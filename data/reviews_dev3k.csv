5	Ah, restaurant week...my favorite! A chance to check out new 'favorite' places...and we found one! \nI often meet friends for coffee at Mama Java's and right down the strip mall I have seen the place...Beckett's Table. But since I am always there during the day (they are only open in the evening) I had never been able to check them out. \nWe decided to go with the restaurant week set menu (which looked fabulous!) I had the zucchini cakes to start (amazingly delicious with green goddess dressing) and my spouse had the white grape gazpacho...very different and VERY good! He had the roasted pork loin for an entree which smelled fabulous and tasted even better!  I had the shepherds pie....not an A+ but pretty tasty. But the desserts were to come....and I had one of the most inventive and imaginative one ever: chocolate dipped bacon s'mores! WOW. An amazing experience! \nThe service was excellent....friendly but not intrusive. And I loved that everyone from the hostess to the servers remembered our name from the reservation. \nThanks for a great evening of food and relaxation! We will be back!
5	I grew up in New Haven, CT with great pizza and have heard about this place for quite some time. We went last night and it was dynamite! The wait was an a hour and a half but next store they have a wine bar to grab a drink and a snack to hold you over. The service was great, the employees who we interacted with had been with the owner for 25 years. The margarita was divine and the wise guy was also tasty. I would highly recommend!
5	I'm what you could call a regular.......\n\nTOP 6! (Hardest top 6 ever composed)\n\n-breakfast: shortstack of lemon ricotta pancakes w/ side of blueberry compote. UM JUST THE NAME MAKES YOU DROOL\n\n-sweet: chocolate covered croissant. think about it. how can you resist!?\n\n-sandwich: SPICY MEATBALL (get meatballs cut in halves, too big to eat whole!) \n\n-salad: oriental chicken salad. the best I have ever had.\n\n-cake: CARROT CAKE!!!! or if it's in season, PUMPKIN PIE!!!! best of the best of the besssssssttttttt\n\n-soup: POTATO SOUP. NOTORIOUS FOR THIS!\n\nTHE END. let me know how it works out. :)
4	Joe's Farm Grill was featured on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives. \n\nJoe's is a very unique place and a must visit if you live in the Phoenix area. Joe's Farm Grill is located on a farm and many of the items on the menu are made with ingredients that are grown on the property, pretty cool. \n\nThey have a menu with traditional items, which are created with unique ingredients.\n\nSome of the best options are the Fontina Burger, the Pesto Chicken Sandwich, and the Portobello Farm Salad. The onion rings are very good, and some of the best I've had.\n\nUnique restaurant with good food, gives Joe's Farm Grill an above average rating of four stars.
1	This place continues to disappoint. For example, today was a nice hot day in PHX and after sitting for more than 10 mins. all I had to show for my time was a menu. This menu of course showed up in the tenth minute of my stay. No H2O. I couldn't stick around to see how long that was going to take. The service at this place is just so so Bad. No really, it's bad. I live in the neighborhood so I like to support the local places but I just can not go back. I worked in the service industry for many many years and am always a good tipper; I'm  always nice to my server or bartender. Spend your money where they appreciate it, these guys apparently don't. How they can get a good review is beyond me.  I'm guessing it's from friends of the employees or owners. It must keep them very busy.
4	Admittedly, I'm not a huge meat eater. At Brazilian Steakhouses, I gorge on the cheesy bread things, mashed potatoes and plantains (and, in Vegas, a pitcher of sangria). This the only Fogo de Chao location I've visited. I'm thrilled that they are open for lunch. I sometimes meet my hubby there (now, he IS a carnivore and makes up for me not eating much meat). It's not crowded, service and food selection are still great, and it's cheaper. Also, kids 5 and under are free. Unfortunately for them, my four year old eats everything. She's in heaven here.\n\nI still think I prefer Texas de Brazil b/c their plantains and potatoes are better. But, Fogo de Chao has palenta. The salad bar area and meats are about equal. \n\nI did notice that the meats are cooked more than some of the other Brazilian steakhouses. More medium-well. The bacon-wrapped filet was great!
5	When I was planning my wedding last year, I was also with child (like Sophie below) so I decided that I needed to find a great tailor that would take care of my dress quickly, because I wasn't sure how much my growing midsection would change within a few weeks time.\n\nI bought my dress 2 sizes too big, because I wasn't sure how much fabric would be needed, and took it to Valentina 2 weeks before the big day.  Not only did she take it in perfectly, but she did it in only a few days and only charged me $30!!  Score one for the prego bride.\n\nI would highly recommend her, she was great, fast and professional.
3	"""I'm not really sure why The Good Egg has such bad ratings.... I've been going here for a very, very long time, and never had any issues with the service or the food. I like this restaurant in particular because they offer healthy alternatives (unlike IHop where you will be eating about 600 calories worth in one double stacked cream cheese pancake whatever). They have really good turkey sausage, as well as delicious bialies. When you're in the mood for something \IHopish,\"""" try one of their plate sized pancakes or the cinnabon... yum."""""""

5	"""Been coming to TexAz since 1985, back in the \Lonestar Steak\"""" days.

1	"""Update:\nDon C, the owner, replied to my comment with this: \Dear Anthony C, Thank you for your rant. Over 2100 guests redeemed their Groupons in the 90 days it ran. Since 1981 I have run D&C's with the guest always in my thoughts. Very happy to honor the $20.00 you spent. Best wishes, Don Carson\""""\n\nMy reply was this:\n\""""Very happy to honor the $20 I spent, is Groupon fine print policy, so of course you are happy to do it. By not honoring the full $40 value, you lost any chance of my being a customer and all of my friends. Which since I've lived in oldtown since 2004 and go out daily to it's restaurants and bars is not a small number of people. There are too many other places that serve a great steak (bandera's, citizen public house, cowboy ciao, etc)\n\nYou are correct, many other people did not get confused like I did. And I am happy for them. They are apparently more clever than I. I tried to come in. I heard your message on a Monday. I got confused. I lost out. If our roles were reversed, I would honor the full $40 groupon for you even if you were the ONLY person who got confused trying to come to my restaurant. Because I thought the purpose of a Groupon was to get new faces in the door.  Especially one that lives walking distance from my establishment and yet has never been in.\n\nFinally, you say you always have the customer in your thoughts? Calling my review a rant is not good customer service. I hope that as folks read your reply they get a clearer picture of your customer service style.  In my opinion my review describes events and my feelings about those events in a logical way, not as a rant.\""""\n\nNow here is the best part:\nGroupon refunded me the $20.  So while Don and Charlie's accused me of ranting, Groupon, who has a FAR larger customer base heard my story and decided a happy customer was worth the refund.  They could have ignored my request given the huge number of clients they have and barely noticed my decreased spending with them.  That is Excellence in Service and I will continue to be a very loyal Groupon customer.\n\nGroupon had this to say when I thanked them for my refund when D&C failed me:\n\""""Hey Anthony, \n\nThank you so much for the feedback! We appreciate feedback in all forms, but it's all the more gratifying when it's positive. \n\nYou've made my day, and we're so happy to have a customer like you. Thanks for your continued support! \n\nTake care, \n\nShannon T. \nGroupon Customer Support\""""\n\nTHIS is what fantastic customer service means. Groupon has my business forever. Not so D&Cs."""""""

2	Oh Amelio's, I remember you from years ago when we used to order pizza's from you almost every Tuesday night, to take advantage of your buy 1 get 1 free pizza special. I haven't had an Amelio's pie in years, so I decided to try them out again by ordering up a large extra cheese & some breadsticks.\n\nThe large cheese pizza tasted ok, but parts of the pizza had absolutely no crust on the end of the slices, it was like eating flatbread pizza with the crust chopped off. C'mon guys, no crust, rly?\n\nThe extra cheese also seemed to be concentrated on just 2 of the 8 slices of the pie, which was disappointing. \n\nThe breadsticks were tasty, but the sauces were way too small to accomodate all the breadsticks. \n\nAmelio's, please make your pizzas better and quit skimping on the sauce sides.
2	Uuuugh. The BF went and picked up food from PF changs tonight because we had a gift card and I still can't go out due to coldy fluish yuck disease.... wtf, I can't shake it. So I got wonton soup (for the throat), the BF got sweet and sour chicken and we shared some dumplings. The soup was so bland.... possibly the most bland wonton soup I have ever tried. The BF thought the sweet and sour chicken was alright.... but the menu says it is pan fried and the chicken is clearly deep fried... yuck. Also, They really don't give you a very large portion for what you pay.... most places I can eat the food for at least two days on what they give you, but the BF finished all maybe 10 pieces of chicken that were on his dish.  I would never pay to eat at this restaurant. Their food is so ridiculously bad for you and expensive. Their double pan fried noodles have just about a full day's worth of sodium and calories... ugh. I do not understand how the PF Changs all stay in business.... they're just not good. I had better chinese food yesterday and the entrees cost 5$....
4	"""The Tom Ka Gai Soup is del-i-cious! This soup makes me so happy you have no idea. Strange huh? Getting happy over soup - it's just that gramazing.  \n\n**Note: When the staff inquire how hot you would like your meal, (even if you like your food spicy - as I do) reply: not spicy thanks. Rather than enhancing the flavor of the food, (if you order your meal \Thai hot\"""" - I think they have 5 levels and I had ordered \""""4\"""") it will make you sneeze/cough unceasingly. They pound the food with pepper and your body will violently rebel."""""""
2	I used to like this place but today it was a big fiasco. \n\nI asked for a table inside but I didn't know that they have a section that looks like a pizza parlor in the middle of Idaho. I was expecting to be seated in the main room but that didn't happened. So we moved to the patio. The weather was hot and I didn't notice anything that could help (idk if there were misters but it wasn't that great).\n\nI had a heffeweizer and it got warm pretty quick, but oh well.\n\nThe edamame was good, crispy and tasteful (I always order edamame without salt).\n\nBut the spinach salad was bad. Lack of taste, the spinach was flavorless, the dressing was boring, all in all a bad salad.\n\nMy friend ordered enchiladas that were ok if you overlooked the presentation (it looks gross, pools of grease, it could look like dog food and the metal dish doesn't help at all).\n\nAnyways, bad salad, bad experience and kind of price for what I got.
4	Love this place! Food is on par every time we go. We love the cheese baklava, but they never have it anymore due to the semi-ok pastries they now make. The service is not bad and everyone there is always so nice. \n\nWe often go to Hookah, which is always fun! I just hate that they automatically add 15% gratuity to every bowl smoked. It wouldn't be a problem if their hookah servers we good every time instead of some of the time.\n\nAll n' All I enjoy going here with my fianc\u00e9e and friends to hang out and have a good time!
5	I discovered this restaurant a few years ago and have yet to find a better Thai restaurant in the greater Phoenix area.  The restaurant is surprisingly slow considering how fantastic the food and service is.  It's not often that you find a place with amazing food and no wait for a table!  My favorites are the tom ka gai soup and curry noodles. \nNearly every time I've gone here, the hostess/waitress always remembers us and is very courteous & friendly.\nIf you like Thai food, you have to check this place out!
3	Really disappointed with this place.  Actually, I shouldn't say that I am wholly disappointed with the place as much as I am disappointed with the quality of service that I get for the outrageous price.\n\nThe wife and I weren't terribly hungry (after a killer breakfast from another of FRC's spots - True Food) but it was lunch time and we weren't going to have a chance to eat again till much later so we wandered over to Zin burger.  Cool place.  Nice inside.  Looks like most of the newer FRC places.  Good vibe, crazy walls, wicked wait for a burger place.\n\nSo we each got a milkshake and then split an order of sweet potato fries and a bacon burger.  The milkshake was a double chocolate mint shake that was excellent.  I didn't think the $6 price tag was outrageous but when it came out and only 1/4 inch of my spoon was sticking out of the glass, I was a bit annoyed.  You know you have shakes, you are the ones who bought the glasses, maybe buy some shake spoons?  For $6 I shouldn't have to fish it out.  Anyways, it was good.  Better than most restaurant shakes, so I was happy.\n\nThe fries came out next.  Thought it was a bit odd since we didn't order them separately but I guess the waiter thought they were our appetizer.  The yogurt dipping sauce is very tart by itself but it a perfect compliment to the fries.  The fries are also bathed in salt so I enjoyed them very much.  In all, the fries were good but the presentation was pretty cheap.  The ramekin of yogurt was sitting on the fries inside the paper-lined basket.  It had spilled on the fries.  I'd prefer a plate.\n\nFinally (and I do mean FINALLY...like 35 minutes after ordering), the burger came out.  It had been cut in half, which I appreciated.  It was cooked to a perfect medium and was pretty tasty.  We gad ordered the Samburger because my wife likes bacon but I really wasn't feeling that bacon.  I wished it had the turkey bacon from True Food because the Applewood Smoked bacon that was on there was hard and tasteless.  In all, it was a good burger.  Was it a good $10 burger?  Not really, but half is enough to fill you up, and if you split it, it is only a $5 burger.  For $5, it is great!\n\nNow to my final complaint and the thing that would normally make me turn this into a 2 star review but I know that they are going to fix it.  Despite their intention to fix it, it was still left this way and still screwed up my experience.  If you sit in one of the booths behind the hostess table, you have a perfect view of the men's bathroom door.  No big deal except, and this is a big except, when someone opens that door to go in...you get a full on view of someone using the urinal.  Now that kind of thing might fly over around 7th Ave & Indian School but not at Biltmore and not for these prices.  I do not want to watch people urinate and do all of the other things that guys do while they are in the bathroom while I am eating.  I'm sorry but it was gross.\n\nLastly, don't have Harold as your waiter.  He was snotty, insistent, and inattentive.  He took plates before we were done, had an attitude when we asked to split the burger, and continually ignored us as he attended to the larger (and subsequently more lucrative) table next to us.\n\nI might give Zinburger another chance but in reality, there are enough burger places along Camelback (Modern Burger, Grind, Culvers, Smashburger, Wineburger, etc) to keep me occupied for a while.
5	So, I just started working in old town Scottsdale, and one of my team members recommended that we have a team lunch somewhere close by in Scottsdale.  Furthermore, she recommended that we go to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, to which I replied, Hellz yes.  Never been there, but it sounded disgustingly great.\n\nMy instincts were correct.  Before I knew it, we were all staring at plates with heavily breaded, fried chicken breasts, thin, crispy waffles and nice sides of GRAVY and mac and cheese.\n\nSweet Jesus - this stuff was AMAZING.  The fried chicken was some of the best I've had, and the waffles, well, they were the BEST waffles I've ever had, done and done.  I ate the fried chicken and mac and cheese first, and then the waffle for dessert.  Epic, simply epic.\n\nThe only thing I didn't have that I wish I did, was a mason jar full of red Koolaid.  It would have been perfect.  I did have iced tea, which was awesome anyway.\n\nThe only drawback to lunch at Lolo's is that I'm now back at the office and experiencing a food coma that at best will negatively impact my productivity, and at worst will snatch the life out of my grease soaked carcass.\n\nFive stars - can't wait to go there after a night of boozing.
5	My review is only for the purchase of a non-disposable diaper at this swim school. As soon as I entered, I was promptly greeted and asked how they could help me. I explained that I was looking for a non-disposable diaper for my lil'un and they asked about weight etc and found the perfect one for her. \n\nThe lady explained to me that the non-disposable diapers are so good that even if for some reason there is an accidental Code Brown, if you know what I mean, they will not charge their patrons. They really believe in the product that they sell. \n\nTheir swimming pool looks nice and clean and this could really be a fun place for little kids. I know they do parent and child classes here also.
2	Well let's see another frozen yogurt shop in the valley....this time at the Scottsdale Quarters. This one won't make my top 10 list of frozen yogurt shops....but it is not horrible.  It is small...quaint....cozy......and the service is pretty good. However it lacks any variety of flavors.....and the color and ambience of the place is not quite fitting for the Quarters. It looks kind of out of place being across the street from H&M and The apple store....but if you yearning for a cold treat it will definitely suffice. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends
2	"""The Grind: sounds like a latex induced club rockin Orgy's - Blue Monday!\n\nHow do you feel to treat me like you do?  This was a Yelp find for me so expectations were high.  At first I thought the place seemed pretty cool - it was dark and dink with a huge bar and flat screens lined up across to catch all the games.\n\nI ordered the sweet and spicy burger while my partner ordered the turkey burger. I'm going to be honest the wait was long, but I guess they were short handed.  Our waiter offered me a free drink afterwards.  Let's say service was real good overall.\n\nThe burger was....huh...plain.  I thought the sweet and sour part didn't really go well.  The burger was huge since the patty itself was a mouth full.  However, mines was dry and crumbly.  I ordered the half and half - herbed fries and sweet potatoes -- it was again okay at best.  \When you lay your burgers upon me and tell me who you are? Those who came before me, I lived through their yelp, from the past reviews, I will turn away.....well turn away. - Enjoy!"""""""
3	I went with a group of people whom had been here before and loved it I thought it was ok. We waited to be sat for a few minutes and the place was pretty empty so it started off just ok fro me. The server/owner sat us while she was talking on the phone which anywhere else would have been so not right, here it actually seemed ok! That being said the atmosphere was very laid back, like there was not a care in the world, and judging by the decore, and clutter in this place I have a feeling i am right on the money. The menu was ok, no greens? I like greens with my southern cookin. I must say the fried chicken was some of the best I have ever had. It was so crispy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside. The waffle was good but had nothin on lolo's. The corn bread was a bit dry and the mac and cheese had good flavor but it was over cooked and mushy! I don't like the dirty taste of catfish but this was not bad, and the okra was okra. I would go back if someone else wanted to go! O the coke was flat!
1	I had been to another location, and while the food was acceptable there (not good, just acceptable) it was HORRIBLE here.\n\nOur $40 got us an order of pastitsio that  was so dried out and overcooked we could not split it with a knife.  Not even a steak knife. The slices of crispy edged gyro meat I was looking forward to in our Greek salad were nowhere in sight.  Instead we were given an undercooked cubed version of the same.  Our Baba ghanoush was not the light whipped consistency it should have been.... it was a smoky thick heavy texture.  No one ate it. It was left on the plate.\n\nThe patio was nice.  It would have been pleasant to sit there and eat.... if the meal hadn't been so horrid.\n\nThe only redeeming quality here was the service.  The waiter a man who appeared to be the manager were terrific.  They were friendly and quick to check on us the whole time we were there.  I hope they find jobs at better restaurants because i would like to be waited on by them again, but I will NOT be going back there.
3	There is certainly a dearth of sushi places in Downtown Phoenix.  I had to find a lunch place in a confined radius, and I wanted sushi, so this is the most promising place I came up with.\n\nLet me start by saying the atmosphere is excellent.  It has a very trendy, upscale vibe to it.  The place bleeds gentrification.  They clearly put a lot of effort into the decor.\n\nThe service was also good, and I was surprised at the server's ability to memorize my order of two rolls, a sashimi, and several nigiri.  As a restaurant, this place is really not bad.\n\nAs a sushi bar, however, this place needs some work.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is how incredibly limited their selection is.  I was really disappointed they don't have uni, and there were a few other glaring omissions (no red snapper, striped bass, etc.).  Clearly, they are not trying to appeal to those who are serious about sushi.\n\nThey did have a couple extra varieties of tuna in, that weren't on the menu, so that was nice.\n\nAbout half way through the meal, I noticed that I didn't have any miso soup.  Of course I didn't order any, but I guess I just assumed that when you order sushi, they just give you a bowl of miso soup.  With how much they charge there ($75 for a light meal for two people, including tip), you'd think they could just throw in a small bowl of cheap soup, right?\n\nThe rolls were OK, I guess.  Nothing special.  The fish tasted fresh enough, no complaints there.\n\nThis place is definitely more about presentation than sushi, and apparently presentation costs a lot.
3	2.5 stars (rounded up to three) for the drink selection, hours and patio.  Points off for lacking authenticity and bland food.\n\nDecent bar, that attempts to bring some much needed diversity to the downtown scene, but ultimately falls a little short.  I appreciate the attempt at  bring an authentic Irish experience- unlike Seamus, it actually looks like a Irish pub, will dark oak wood, cozy booths, but unlike Seamus, it doesn't quite feel authentic yet.  Perhaps after it has a few years to wear in and replace the fresh paint smell with a stale beer smell and the bar stools and booths have gotten and little more worn in.  Also, i find the atmosphere a tad sparse and spread out for an authentic pub experience-  no real intimacy or jostling for position at the bar, even when it is supposedly 'busy'. On the other hand, I will give Turf gets high marks for one of the few pubs downtown to actually have a patio, which is a big plus when the weather is good.\n\nIt's not a bad place to grab a 'real' (i,.e 2- oz) pint of an Irish beer.  However, where thy really shine is their broad selection of Irish whiskeys.  Rumor has it that the have the second largest selection in AZ (one less that their big brother Seamus) . \n\nUnfortunately, the food isn't up to par with their bar.  Yes, the waffle fries are decent way to soak up some of the booze you consume, but the real menu flats flat.  While they have a decent menu, including some attempts at irish classics like boxty, bangers and mash, corned beef and cabbage, and fish and chips (which can be quite tasty), the quality and tastiness just aren't there. This may have worked for Seamus, when it was the only pub in the downtown core, but it  doesn't cut it at turf, whose in the vicinity of several great restaurants and bars (including two in the same building and one right around the corner), which are are head and shoulders above Turf...  \n\nMy advice?  A good place to meet a friend for a pint before diner, or to stop by after dinner on Friday's and Saturdays for the live music, but only rat here if you are desperately hungry.
4	We've been here several times and really like the food. We dont tend to take too many risks when it comes to sushi so we typically order what we like. Anything with tuna, crab, salmon etc...Starters and sides are always good. Everything is always on point.\n\nWith the name comes a little hook. The wasabi they serve is dyed blue which is kind of odd. If you put some wasabi in your soy sauce, like I do...It turns your rice blue and eventually....your teeth. Just odd. You can ask for natural green wasabi and they'll bring you some.\n\nLike others have said, the drinks are a little light. If they loosen the bar up a little and bring me green wasabi....its all good. We'll be back
3	So I come to beautiful AZ for work and this is where I normally stay. It is in a good location in Scottsdale and close to the four offices I work at so it is cool. The service is always pretty good. The overall appearance is out dated but it is not bad looking. The food is pretty freaking food for hotel food. I have ordered salmon which was tdf! This morning I ordered a cheese omelette and it was good too! The pool is nice and so are the grounds overall. The one thing I didn't like was the woman at check in. She was not very helpful and seemed bothered on top of it. I tried redeeming my free appetizer for checking in but there was a catch, the bartender told me I had to sit down for a full dinner to redeem. Sucks!! Oh well, overall it was a nice stay.
2	We were told that this was a good place to go with our 2 kids.  We arrived at 5:45 on a saturday evening, and they were slammed.  The service was slow, I am pretty sure our waitress had WAY too many tables.  I got the bacon blue burger and it was good, although they overcooked, I asked for medium and it was well.  My husband liked his southwestern wrap, until he picked up the second half and discovered a hair on the plate.  Once our waitress returned she immediately took it away and asked him if he wanted anything else, but at that point he lost his appetite.  They did take the $ off the bill.  It took our waitress at least 10 minutes to bring the check once we asked for it, then we paid partly with cash and partly with a card.  We instructed that she take the cash off the bill and put the rest on the card, she returns, cash gone, and full amount on the bill.  Now we stand around another 10 minutes waiting for her to return.  Finally get it all taken care of and get out of there. Definitely not someplace I would recommend or return to.  Maybe it is better during the week when they aren't as busy?
5	I love Tott's. The atmosphere almost makes me feel at home and the guys always working the counter?-- An absolutely wonderful man who always talks to everybody and walks around checking that everything's okay. It's worth it to go just to see his smiling face! But then again, there's the food which is cheap and delicious. Right around Panda Express prices but so much better-- everything feels and tastes fresher and better. The veggies are crisp. The meat is flavorful and good. Sauces are thick and delicious. I can't stress enough that you should try this place. Don't go to Pei Wei. Support this guy and his wonderful Asian food.
4	3 stars for food\n4 stars for everything else\n\nWe wanted to try something new and so we decided to try this place.  First of all, I love the fact that they have plenty of free parking; even on a Sat night.  The restaurant is actually much larger than I thought with the huge back room where we were seated.  \n\nSince it is a German restaurant, we were ready to try their beer but didn't have a clue as to which one...our waitress took delivery of bringing us samples to see which one we favor.  That was very nice of her.  After ordering the beer, we had the imported pretzel, Paprika Schnitzel, Sauerbraten.  \n\n*Pretzel = YUM!  It was crusty on the outside and very chewy inside.\n*Paprika Schnitzel = very much like Japanese cutlet.  Not as flavorful..\n*Sauerbraten = we tried it because we heard that it takes 4 days.  Honestly, the only thing we could taste was the thick sauce, the meat was kinda tough, and the pasta was bland.  On the upside, I liked the red cabbage.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience with live German music, great beer and pretzel.  \nBut would we go back?...probably not.\n\n*Ambiance = Wonderful!  It doesn't really feel like AZ.\n*Food = mediocre...we prefer more flavor\n*Area = good.  in the middle of old town Glendale.\n*Service = great.  we had a wonderful waitress who took very good care of us.
5	You have to do this. If you are reading this that means you are thinking about it. Stop thinking. Do it. Impossibly romantic this Scottsdale hideaway is understated, intimate and refined. Curving walkways through bougainvillea and honeysuckle camouflage casitas and villas all with private terraces. The rooms are Mediterranean Spanish with fireplaces and comfortable sitting chairs at the base of the massive bed. Go for the designer casitas. No two are alike. They are all amazing. The entire resort is filled with nooks and crannies where you can find solitude and luxuriate with a cocktail while you soak in the scented breezes and warm sun. It's like a private residence you have to yourself with a few others. The service is over the top good. Room service twice a day including turn-down with ice buckets and spring water. Need your car? Make one call and it's waiting at the entrance. The spa is small but you have it to yourself. Steam room, jacuzzi, massage. Do it again before martinis and a fabulous meal at T. Cooks, the on-site four star restaurant. In short, for a three day romantic getaway, there is no place I'd rather be than the Royal Palms.
4	"""I don't live in AZ, but have been here quite often and stopped in at the Martini Ranch a few times. It has a nice bar/lounge kind of feel and the patio is well set up. The crowd is 25-35 with a nice blend of tourists and locals. So overall, it's a pretty decent spot.\n\nHowever, I stopped in there on 8/27/09 and was utterly appalled. After hearing a decent DJ play house/techno and a pretty fun band that sounded like a Sublime/Beastie Boys/Lincoln Park fusion, this idiot called \Dirt Nasty\"""" took the microphone. He started screaming lets party, do pills, snort yeyo, etc. and he was completely wasted. I thought Andrew Dice Clay swore a lot, but this guy takes the cake. At least Dice was funny back in the day with his vulgarity...this clown was just downright annoying. He was by far the least talented person I have ever seen perform anywhere. I could have gone up on stage and sang these awesome lyrics, \""""I'm in Arizona, and I drank a Corona, then I got a big bona so I called her on the phona\"""". Reallly? Are you kidding me? Whoever decided to put this fool on stage should be fired."""""""
3	"""This place is right down the street from the office, and I've gone here with co-workers for lunch many times over the past few months.  The place is okay, and seems to have some serious track betting going on here. Several TV's with horse racing on, machines and some betting tickets and such. I'm not much of a better myself, so I'm not even really sure how it works at this place.\n\nAnyways, I'm kind of torn between two and three stars for this place.  For starters, the inside kind of feels dated, and its always dark when we're there. Also, we usually sit in the back when we are here, since our party size is usually between 6 and 9 people at any given time.  Someone always calls ahead from the office to let them know we're coming in, so they already have the table set up in the back for us when we arrive.\n\nMy problem is two fold with Armadillos. First, is that it the service always seems slow, and secondly, they don't seem to have a great lunch menu. It seems to be mostly dinner type dishes, that can be quite big and heavy for the middle of the day.  They have an insert to their menu with \daily specials\"""" but nothing that really caters to the lunch crowd.  I mean, sometimes I want a light lunch, not a huge heavy lunch that makes me tired for the rest of the day.\n\nAlso, most of the time here it seems to take forever to get our bill, and our food. I know their busy cooking it, but being that they open at 11 AM, and when we arrive we're usually the first people to be in there (aside from a few stragglers at the bar) I wish it wouldn't take so long to get our food.  Plus, we only have an hour for lunch!  One time, it took so long to get our bill, we started getting ansy and tried to hurry out of the place. We have to be back at the office by 12:30, and we didn't get our bills until 12:30!  By the time we all got our change and cards back and left, it was after 12:45, and we didn't get back to the office until 12:50.  We were 20 minutes late back from lunch!\n\nI only go here now because once in a while the ladies from work take me, and its not half bad food. I just wish they had a better lunch time menu and that the service would pick up a bit so we don't spend so much time waiting and paying for our bills."""""""
5	One girl was talking to her friend and the friend's mom so I had to re-stand in the line while a few others who walked in after me got waited on by the one poor girl trying to help everyone but she was pleasant. I loved my purchases, oreo fudge, mint oreo fudge and peanut butter in chocolate fudge. Crappy customer service wont keep me away from chocolate, I mean it will somewhat but I will go there again. Ill just make sure I stay away from the one girl and get in line for the other girl.
4	Sweet republic - hands down, it is delicious and good. Get the toffee banofi - leave the place with a full belly, happy. :)\n\nToffee Banofi - Delicious! Sometimes when I get sundaes, they either have too much syrup, ice cream, whipped cream, etc but it's perfect. All the little pieces in the sundae is just delicious. I love the little toppings on top, it's so good. I died and went to heaven. \n\nI give this place 4 stars because for $8, I thought the item would be bigger. However, it's a good size - not too much to cause diabetes or too little to leave me hungry. Plus, we shouldn't eat too much ice cream, we don't want to be part of the diabetes epidemic in US but it's soo hard when ice cream is a food we can die for -- we can stand in the middle of the road and eat ice cream in awe as the cars go by us. :)\n\nI went during the afternoon on Sunday. I came when it was slightly busy. The wait can be long if the line is long because there's only two people and they help each person at a time but they provide good service overall! \n\n:)
4	I LOVE Fresh Wasabi!  \nThis place is consistently good.  Always high quality and fresh.  They have a decent happy hour.  I don't think I've ever ordered something here that I didn't like.  I've tried as many of the rolls, sushi, and sashimi options as I can and I can't even choose a favorite.  I frequently go for the Snow White roll.  The place is small and casual, but clean and the service is usually just fine.  They've also been very accommodating with modifications and even custom-made rolls for one of my veggie-friends.  \nGo here for good sushi.
5	"""I've been to Postino Central about five times in the last two months.  The atmosphere is a cute little restaurant with large tables for groups and outdoor seating as well. I have gone with small groups of 3-4 and larger groups of 9+, and we are seated within a reasonable amount of time. The outdoor seating can get a bit warm in hotter months, though.  The parking is complimentary (complimentary + tip, actually), so make sure you have some cash on hand, or the Light Rail is just about a block away or less. \n\nThe wine selection is nice, although I haven't seen a Chianti on the menu. They also carry hard-to-find beers, such as my favorite, Duval and Raspberry Framboise.  The bruschetta is delicious, and there are interesting choices, such as white bean/tomato/basil and fig/apple/cheese, quite tasty!\n\nUpdate: Since I wrote this, about 4-5 trips later, again, wow, I'm so impressed with this place. In October, a friend came to visit and we had a party of 15 on a Saturday night. I made reservations, but they had the table ready to go by 6:55 pm and didn't mind that just three of us sat down while waiting for the others. The servers were quite attentive, and I've never had to wait. I recently brought my mom last week, and she described the food as \delicious,\"""" and today took part in the 3-5pm $5 happy hour, delish!  Another perk - it's so chill. I noticed many people wearing jeans or shorts at Postino today, yet some people dress up.\n\nThe only thing that can be annoying - if you can't find parking or if the valets are done for the day, be careful about where you park in the street. I've had friends who got tickets."""""""
5	Okay. I think it's safe to say that the Cine Capri at Tempe Marketplace is the best screen to watch any movie. There's usually a couple dollar increase in the ticket price, but it's worth is if you want to enjoy the movie you are there to watch. This theater gets the most attention from staff as well so it's always clean. It's also the best place to watch a movie on opening night. Go see TRON at this theater December 16th.
2	Cadillac Ranch seems like the Scottsdale away from Scottsdale. I've been here a few times and the crowd has always seemed stuck up.  I can't comment on the food as I've never tried it... so all I'm commenting on is the bar hoppers and the bar tenders.\n\nThe bar staff was nice one time... but I think it was just because I went there when it was slow and they (she) would come talk to me. However, the other time I went I may as well jumped behind the bar and made my drink myself... I'm not even sure they would have noticed. Maybe this isn't a slam to the bartenders themselves as maybe they were understaffed... as it was to the owners. \n\nI dunno... I just haven't had the best time here.
4	We went here for my birthday dinner. We started with the pulled pork on corn cakes. Delicious! My husband had the smoked salmon pizza and I have the macaroni and cheese. The pizza was wonderful, the mac and cheese needed a pit more seasoning, but was creamy and satisfying nonetheless. We had the sticky toffee cake for dessert. I bake, so I have high standards for dessert. This was a little lackluster. I'd skip dessert next time. \n\nOverall, a pleasant experience, good service, nice atmosphere and a great wine selection.
2	Not overly impressed.......  It was a large group which I know presents some problems, but the server was not attentive (maybe because he know there would be a Forced 18% tip??). The food was OK, the drinks were OK, although a little on the expensive side. You have to BUY Chips, but thier so-so tortilla's are free.....  Checks showed up severl in a folio, but nothing was said, leading to some confusion. Then the server was indignat about it.  Not sure I would go back, which is a shame as the atmosphere was good..........
5	Hadn't been to BJ's for a few years and I had forgotten how great the food is there.  Went on a busy Friday night, but only had to wait about 20 minutes or so to be seated.\n\nStarted with classic potato skins.  Perfect.  Cheddar, bacon, and cheese with sour cream and/or ranch dressing.   Bring friends, this is not a single serving plate.\n\nFor the entree I chose the Tuscan Chicken Lemone.  It's new on the menu and I hope they keep it for a some time.  Wonderful flavor - lemon and butter, good stuff.  Pasta was tasty too.  And the cheese bread?  Don't get me started. \n\nNormally at BJ's I would have a beer, but I felt like something different so I ordered a nonalcoholic berry cider.  Only lightly sweet and very snappy, it was quite refreshing and a nice change from overly ambitious drinks that crowd out the flavors of a good meal.\n\nToo full for desert so nothing to report.  The service was very good - prompt, accurate, and engaging.  \n\nThe only issue we had was with the fold out extension for our table.  Every time my friend (G.) hit the top of the table too hard (he's a big guy, but still) the magnetic latch would give way and the extension would swing down and whack one of us in the leg.  After a while I just moved my leg out of harms way and was mildly entertained every time G. would get stung in the thigh.  Probably an anomaly, but a stronger magnet might be a good idea.
5	What a great experience. I was able to make a reservation through Yelp while we were driving there.  The decor was beautiful with linen tablecloths and napkins.  There was great soft Italian music playing in the background.  Our table was stocked with our own grated parmesan cheese and olive oil.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  We were really surprised at how fast the food came.  I had the roasted chicken, which was cooked perfectly, with crispy red potatoes, best ever!  My husband and mother in law (who are both Italian) had the eggplant parmesan which they both raved about.  They also have family portions that are very reasonable.  The price was a little bit more than the Olive Garden but it was so worth it.  Especially, when the waiter cleared our dishes and said that since the eggplant parmesan was a classic pasta dish, we would get 2 more to take home.  So, 3 of us ate for $65 and we took home lunch for the next day.  We will be back!
4	Honestly I cannot say I got the full treatment of Chase field.  Faraway seats, and I honestly was a bit sleepy, and it was an exhibition game, so it had only about 20,000 fans.\n\nI will say it is a beautiful field, has a nice jewel-box stadium feel to it.  When the roof and some walls are open, there is a nice view of the mountains.  Workers were friendly, except the guy who spotted we were a section too close.\n\nAll in all, its a great place to watch a game.  I will no doubt go back when I am back an Arizona.
4	Like Red Robin, Carraba's is my go-to Italian joint that I know I wont be disappointed in.  \n\nI love their bread and the yummy oil/herbs that go with it.  I do ask for butter as well, but they always seem to bring out this frozen ball of butter.  I don't get that.\n\nThe best dish they have is their Pollo Rosa Maria.  It consists of two chicken breasts, stuff with fontina cheese and covered with a huge helping of sauteed mushrooms.  Make sure to get it with fettuccine alfredo.  It's a must!... if you don't like pasta, I dont know what to tel ya.  The combo of the two is a match made in heaven.\n\nThey have great salads and their own special house dressing.  Heads up on your ranch lovers.  they do not have ranch dressing.\n\nAs for their deserts, Im not much of a fan until they have their quarterly creme brulet.\n\nGood food!
5	"""This is a real gem in Old Town Scottsdale. Perfect for an intimate date or hanging out with friends to chatter. The perfect place to start or end an evening... \n\nVery charming and intimate, lots of nice regulars (me included), tables and a cute fireplace outdoors, smoking-friendly patio, another private upstairs patio too.\n\nGreat Martinis and mixed drinks! If \Kevin\"""" is working: he'll give you a discount if you mention his \""""fabulous roller blading skills\""""...  :)\n\n(located just east of Main and Brown on the sidewalk)\n\n\n\n*UPDATE* 2009 - now called Brackin's Bar it is just as cool!!!"""""""
5	Siver Mine is up there on my favorite subs list in the valley. I tried Jimmy John's and I regretted not going to Silver Mine. I have tried almost every hot sub they have and my favorites include: Cripple creek (if I'm in the mood for ranch), Frontier (if I want BBQ), Steam engine (meatball mood) or the Buffalo Stampede (buffulo sauce). I have a hard time choosing between these 4 every time and I have to go through every scenario to decide. It's awesome that they deliver so late! I would say my experiences are 50/50, half delivery and half at the Mill location, both awesome!
4	This place probably had some bad reviews when they first opened up.  They probably were issues at that time.  \n\nAnyway, My wife and I have been here many times as customers.  They have improved over the time, and are perhaps now respectable.  \n\nGo on the weekends (Saturday or Sunday morning), and enjoy their dim sum.  It is good for Mesa AZ.  It is not like Hong Kong, but it is good.\n\nAlso, you should go there for the hot pot.  Wife and I went there yesterday for hotpot.  I suggest some kind of combination like the following:\n\nSzechuan Pepper Broth\nChicken\nSpinach\nVermicelli\n\nCreate a hotpot from this.  The only thing that I would recommend to Mekong Palace for the hot pot area, which you cook yourself at your table, is that they provide some recommended combinations on the hot pot menu based upon what they see being ordered.  This may make this more accessible and allow them to attract some adventurous non-Asian customers.
3	My husband and I have been here twice. The first was last summer during the late happy hour. The food was really discounted but still pretty good - the steak sandwich was especially tasty - although I would recommend avoiding the pizza, which had overly sweet sauce, congealed cheese, and vegetables that tasted canned. We sat outside and enjoyed the view of the street. For the price we paid for the food, it was an enjoyable experience. The second time we went was for dinner and the prices for food were a lot higher. Our food was definitely tasty - the lamb shank and steak tenderloin bruschetta were very flavorful - but the prices felt a little high and perhaps more fitting for a hotel restaurant. That being said, the drinks were good, the atmosphere was comfortable yet trendy, and the service was attentive, if self-important. I would definitely return for happy hour or a special event, but probably not for dinner.
1	I've been here twice, once for the grand opening and once more recently.\n\nThe first time everything went pretty well and the restaurant would have received a 4 to 5 star rating.\n\nThe last time I was there was with a party of 8.  We waited 45 minutes for a table after being told the wait would be 15.  The only reason we got the table so quickly was because we asked if something had come available - our buzzers hadn't gone off and no one had come to let us know something was available.\n\nWe were put in a corner where we were quickly forgotten.  It took over an hour to get edamame and two medium sushi boats.  Once it came out we quickly ordered 3 rolls hoping they would be ready by the time the boats had finished.  An hour later they arrived.  An hour for three rolls.  In all we spent 3 hours at Stingray and probably 30 minutes eating.  The other 2.5 hours were spent waiting.  \n\nThe restaurant is nice and the sushi is good but the service was so poor that I would not go back.\n\nOh, and when the waitress finally showed up with the check she told us, out loud, that since we were a part of more than 6 (I think) that an 18% gratuity was included automatically.  That was a bit audacious.  Maybe she was just clarifying the bill but after her terrible service she is lucky that stop-loss policy is in place or her tip would have been tiny.
5	Had a great meal here on 4th of July....could see fireworks all across the Valley from our table, and had a superb meal.  I had heirlooms and burrata, to start, the filet mignon, and nice Pinot.  Every course was delicious, including the bread, and dessert was quite a pleasant experience.  The croquettes were borderline life-changing (in a good way), as were the hazelnut, chocolate creme lollipops that came with the check.  Waitstaff was classic 4S in terms of hospitality, and seemed like quite bunch of foodies themselves.
3	I would really love to give Valley Metro more stars. Really, I would. I am a large proponent of taking the bus when I can. I do own a car, so it is not for lack of other transportation that I frequently take the bus. It is for the simple reason that Stevey stated-- Valley Metro will supply more routes when the demand is there. And Phoenix can't afford to have so much sprawl and no form of mass transit. If we would all just suck it up and step away from our SUVs for one to two trips a week, Valley Metro might have the funds to have a ligitimate system!\n\nHonestly, the buses are nice. Mostly, they are clean and on-time. You can check the schedule at www.ValleyMetro.org before you go so you will know the fatest route to take. You can even plan your route from there. It's cheap-- only $1.25 to ride, and free transfers for the next two hours. You just definintely need to set aside a good chunk of time to get where you're going!
3	I had heard about this place for quite some time and decided to check it out. The pizza was good, but not amazing. The way the restaurant was laid out was quite confusing and I kept having to ask the employees there how to order, where to get drinks, and where they would call my name. The confusion lies in the fact that they let the grocery image of the business run front. I think that is silly since I heard about that via there pizza that should be there flagship business IMO. Anyway, back to the food it was good, but not better then pizza bianco, but I agree it is a nice place to take a date if its casual.\n\nDue to the location and the fact that the pizza is just ok, i probably wont go there too often.
4	"""I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about- I'm wondering if that review wasn't written under a bogus ID that is a front for a competitor of Argentos. The fact that he reviewed three pizza places in one day, and then reviewed two others on the same day 34 days later seems fishy to me- who orders pizza from two or three places in the same day or even the same week? Anyway,  Believe me, if you've read my review of Landini's Pizza in San Diego, then you understand that \I know from pizza\"""" as the saying goes in  NY.  \n\nPizza is one of the trinity foods of the greater NYC area, the other two being bagels and authentic deli.  All three are frequently imitated but seldom duplicated accurately outside of a 50 mile radius of Manhattan.\n\nI moved to AZ for a variety of reasons, and specifically to Buckeye in order to be in proximity to family plus for a great deal on a house.  Why else would I subject myself to the hinterlands of Maricopa County, the epicenter of AZ?  Never in my wildest dreams would I imagine that in a sleepy town best known for farms and rodeo (as well as the only way to LA prior to the completion of I-10) a pizza man from NYC would decide to relocate his family and business. The owner, who is ethnically half Italian and half Albanian (a country across the narrow Adriatic from Italy) cut his dough tossing chops in NY for over twenty years and it shows as soon as you walk in the door- the old school style menu over the counter using plastic letters to detail the numerous subs, dinners, and even Sicilian style pies are a throwback to every neighborhood pizza joint I've ever patronized in my fifty plus years.  There are no conveyor belt ovens, no round pizza grates or pans, just pumice lined pizza ovens fired up over five hundred degrees. \n\nRelatives from NJ just departed after a family wedding; last Thursday one of them had a yen for pizza, a food I normally would not recommend they order away from home because the quality would be dicey at best. Not only could I recommend Argentos, but I encouraged them to order.  The Jerseyites were not disappointed, and in fact they proclaimed the pizza to be excellent and delicious.\nWhat better validation could a pizza shop get?"""""""
3	This is the most organized and cleanest Dollar Store that I've been to! In the gift aisles, all of the gifts were neatly placed on the shelves. All of the similar items were even grouped together (Example: all of the rubber duckies were together). Now that is a lot or organization! \n\nIt was fun to go through the greeting cards and all of the aisles. This store has a lot more products in stock!\n\nStore Hours:\nSunday: 10am - 7pm\nMonday - Saturday: 8am - 9pm
5	For 30 seconds, I get to be a kid again riding up and down the hydraulic smooth glass elevators, with the fountain view. This is the best part about the library. The effecient energy oriented building architecture is probably one of the best example of civic offering from the City of Phoenix. There are plenty of parking also.\n\nFor the real deal, the inside is spacious with plenty of good style seating spread apart. There are about 5 stories of books and media items you can  check out. It is a general purpose library and not meant to be as specialized as a university library. Being a Library of Phoenix card member allows me to go to any of their 12 local branches to check out items and I believe they have an inter-library loan process for getting books from other libraries or US universities. Also you can browse their catalog online and I believe there is also free wifi in all branches.\n\nFor a general multipurpose public library, I can't ask for more.
4	Great Hotel, stayed here for a single night during Saboten Con, very comfortable rooms and hotel staff were friendly and helpful even despite the somewhat hectic and bizarre events occurring during the convention. The room was clean and had very nice accommodations. You pay more to stay here, but you also get more, its worth it if you have the cash to burn for comfort. \nThey also use Aveda products for the complimentary shampoos and soaps, which is a really nice touch imo.
5	Dig it! Good beers on tap. Tasty food. Friendly servers. Cool place to hang out and relax. My fav pasty is the cajun chicken with the spicy sauce. Don't forget to check out the desserts. Towards the back is an iPad where you can pick a few tunes to be played..kinda neat if you're in the mood for something in particular. If you haven't checked it out, you should. I like this location better than the Tempe location because it has more seating and a better scene for visiting with friends.
2	I didn't like this place so much, maybe because I'm Vietnamese? But their food is nothing special really. Very common for a Vietnamese restaurant but their specialty is their rice plates so I would hope it was delicious.\n\nI love my food to come out hot if it is suppose to be hot or at least warm maybe but when I order their special rice plate, the meats came out cold and the rice was a little warm. Didn't even bother asking them to reheat it because the staff there seems no where to be found. I do like that the plates do come with a bowl of hot soup which do come out hot [:\n\nI don't know. If you don't have a Vietnamese mom who knows how to cook rice plates then I would recommend going here but I do have a mother who can do better so I definitely will not be returning.
4	My father and I have eaten here several times and it is definitely a favorite. My father discovered it when he was staying at a hotel nearby many years ago and wound up eating there every night for a full week. The food is always delicious, the drinks are always delightful, the service has never failed to be friendly and inviting, and the restaurant is always clean.  \n\nThe last meal we enjoyed consisted of a chicken avocado sandwich and the voodoo tuna. The sandwich was arranged on two butter hamburger buns that were so fresh they melted in my mouth and the chicken was moist and very tender. The jalapeno mayonnaise added just the right kick and I scarfed it and the accompanying sweet potato fries down within minutes.\n\nEven though I liked my sandwich, the voodoo tuna was a few steps above it. Juicy lightly seared tuna steak with pickled ginger on the top that gave it so much flavor my tongue didn't know what to focus on first. Dad could barely comment on the meal between bites, it was so good. \n\nWe ordered mojitos that were prepared exactly the way a mojito should be, with lots of mint, lime and just the right amount of rum. The complimentary cornbread was freshly baked and delicious as usual. And to top off the evening, we ordered the chef dessert which was chocolate lava cake filled with a thick dark chocolate center that had a slight hint of peppermint. A scoop of pistachio icecream balanced the dish nicely and by the time we had nearly licked the plate clean, we were stuffed and quite content.
4	My friend and I had appointments for blow-outs at the Phoenix location and unfortunately when we got there the hot water heater was broken!  So the owner, Melodi, offered us complimentary makeup applications while we waited for it to be repaired.  The artist did an amazing job on my makeup and was so sweet.  The hot water heater still wasn't fixed so Melodi offered us free thermal styles with the curling iron.  Our hair looked so glamorous and when we went to dinner with our husbands that night they couldn't stop telling us how great we looked.  I was really impressed by how Melodi handled the situation with the hot water and I would definitely, definitely go back.
4	Found this place by accident yesterday while walking in Old Town. Immediately checked it on Yelp and saw it had a great rating, and then we found out why.The gelato here was excellent, and we have had our share of gelato in many places. Flavor choices were very good. Some flavors like Samoa and Roche I had never seen. I had Samoa and my husband had the Roche, which was delicious and tasted like hazelnut. Would definitely go back there to try another flavor or even the pizza we saw being made that looked great.
4	"""Being carnivores, this is only the third time we have been to a vegie restaurant.  We were very impressed.  I had the Mongolian beef.  It really tasted like beef!  Others in our party said the \ham\"""" tasted just like ham and the \""""chicken\"""" tasted just like chicken.  The amazing part is that the \""""beef\"""" and the \""""chicken\"""" had a grain to it just like the real stuff.  I didn't see the ham.  None of the \""""meats\"""" tasted like soy.  This recently opened place does have some problems with ordering and service.  Our server brought four forks and two knives for our party of five.  I'm sure the service will improve after they have been open a while.  Another negative is that the menu provided has no descriptions of the dishes!  What are they thinking?  We will be back the next time we are in Glendale.  I think the AZ natives we were with will be regulars."""""""
3	This dog park is simple enough. It's small and convenient but it has two things that will ruin any good dog park.\n\n1. It's very close to a playground. Kids love to come in and play with (or even pick up) random peoples dogs. Which is not okay. It creates such a hostile environment and makes all the owners nervous. \n\n2. People who have no idea what dog park etiquette is. Every time I come here I experience at least one owner who doesn't watch their dog, doesn't pick up their dogs waste, or gets mad at someone elses dog when clearly it's their dog causing the problem. Also those owners who hover over their dog and push any other dog trying to sniff or play with them away. \n\nMy dogs love this park but I won't bring them here because I'm always terrified of what kind of situation might happen with the inevitable kids and stupid pet owners.
2	This place is old school.  That's good, because it doesn't make me want to spend more money than I have to.  It reminds me of the A&P store I worked at 26 years ago.  \n\nThe deli has a good selection of meats and cheeses, sliced to order, and the service in the deli was very friendly (Christine ?maybe??).\n\nThe lines are ridiculous.  I only shopped here twice and both times the wait was just stupid.  The second time was particularly annoying because I was buying one item and the self-serve checkout wasn't accepting my card (for $1.50), and so I had to go to the regular cashier.  They had NO express lanes, so I had to get behind people doing their shop for the week.  And the few lanes they had open each had at least 4 people in them.  Very frustrating.  Glad I don't have to shop here again.
5	We were able to get a great cut of brisket here, just over 3lbs which is just what we wanted.  It may look scarce when you walk in but most of the meat is kept in the back so just ask.  In addition to pastrami brisket you can get corned beef brisket, chicken, and assorted other deli meats.  They have have a grocer section where we were able to pick up challah rolls (mmm...challah french toast anyone?), matzo meal for latkes and my husband's favorite pickles- Ba Tampte.  There are also lots of other selections ranging from candy to cous cous to egg flakes and cereals.  \n\nThey have a pizza place next door (which may have deli offerings as well...) called King Solomon's but Segals itself is just a pure butcher and grocer.  Having grown up with kosher pizza we opted to not grab a slice because to be honest, kosher pizza isn't all that good.
4	My husband and I love Thai Lahna.  We used to go there every time my husband returned from a business trip.  We live in the wrong part of the valley now, but we'll definitely go back if we're in the neighborhood!  The quality has been consistent over the years, and my husband has been going there since he was a kid.  The coconut milk iced cream is a treat we haven't been able to find anywhere else (as good, anyway).
4	I just had dinner here tonight with my Dad and Brother and enjoyed everything.  We started with the shrimp appetizer which was delicious but just a bit too small, then my dad and brother enjoyed the cob salad which i must say was DEElicious.  I then had the Seabas as my entre and i must admit, i ordered it because the recipe sounds very similar to my favorite dish at Wildfish across the street so i wanted to see how it compared-and i feel like that was poor form on my part.  The fish was wonderful-however because of the incredibly similar presentation of the dishes i sided with my original favorite-perhaps out of being biased but it was also smaller here...\nOther than that-we each ordered glasses of wine and were AMAZED by the knowledgeability of wine our waiter had.  He was unbelievably helpful with suggestions and history of the wine.  It was very refreshing.\nFor desert we all enjoyed the Key Lime Pie which is one of my personal favorites.\nOverall i really have enjoyed my experiences at this restaurant and would recommend this and any other of the Fox Restaurants to anyone.
5	Living in Louisiana, you always want to have something that reminds you of your childhood.  Well, Jamburritos also brought some innovation to the table too for the new age/ adult in me.  I went to the Great Cajun Cookoff and was amazed at what I tasted.  Red Beans and Rice and Jambalaya intertwined into burritos/tacos?  Also, the Catfish was cooked to perfection too.  I just wanted to tip my hat off to this express truck and excited to try something else on their menu!
4	"""This is not a typical Sonoran Mexican food place, so you have to leave that craving at the door.  Rather, it's inspired by a number of regions around Mexico, with great result.\n\nOne tip... They get \heat\"""" and will adjust or accommodate (though some dishes can't be dialed back; they know which ones and can advise).    When the server says it's hot, she's probably not calibrating to some bland Midwestern palate (ie, garlic mashed potatoes are spicy)  but to the desert rat tongue (mas jalapenos por favor).  Even better, they can kick it up a few notches if you ask, and are happy to cook in extra peppers or chiles.  \n\nThey have a terrific selection of tequilas, though these come at a somewhat excessive cost.  It would be nice to match up a few choice  agave spirits with the meal without feeling like I've been rolled.  That almost made it a three, but this place just isn't average, so have your shots elsewhere."""""""
4	Another hit or miss Ross, but I've found some great bargains on Michael Kors clothing here.\nI've also gotten designer sunglasses that I would have paid more for! \n\nA great place for women with patience. I often have to try on several things and only leave with a few, but I've found several great basics of finer quality for my wardrobe.\n\nAlso, the dressing room associates are friendly. No one here seems to hate their job, and the store is kept up nicely. The cashiers are quick.
4	"""A little box in Tempe serving pretty cheese, air, and goo. Read on.\n\nBACKGROUND\n----------------------\nLunch. Me. Bonnie G. \n\nWe're strung out on Cartel caffeine (or at least I am), hit a museum, and start becoming pretty listless and hungry as we trudge through 101 degree Tempe (or at least I was). \n\nI had one dining option in mind. But Bonnie had another suggestion. And I bit. Because Essence was close. And did I mention I was listless and hungry? Onwards.\n\nSETTING\n-------------\nNot a big place at all. One side is all windows which brightens up the place, with some patio seating facing University. No misters outside though. A bunch of two and four-tops, with some one-tops to boot. Counter to the right, with a display case of all the baked goods, including a variety of macaroons. \n\nCurrent art selection: a bunch of San Francisco neighborhood photographs plus a great one of the Golden Gate. Not bad.\n\nClientele: definitely not ASU undergrad Cheba Hut Tempe. More like ASU grad student Tempe, professors, professionals, health nuts, and ladies who probably lunch here after tai chi and painting still life. Definitely bring your mom here for brunch. This has her name all over it. \n\nFOOD\n---------\nI go for the croque madame ($6.95) because I like saying the word \gruyere!\"""" in an exaggerated Three Musketeer accent. I also like to eat gruyere, coincidentally.\n\nI then decide to also order a mashed potato cake, simply because I've never had before.\n\nAlso? Two macarons* - the mint chocolate and the espresso. They're apparently the stars of the grand Essence Bakery show, so when in Tempe...\n\n* I'll disclose now that I've never really liked macarons before but I thought I'd give them another try. Bonnie G hinted they were like crack. And I usually trust what she says, for there's a galaxy of smart behind those glasses.\n\nVERDICT\n-------------\nFirst: the macarons. Or as I call them: frothy discs of air and goo. The mint chocolate was an Incredible Hulk green color which I didn't think was all that necessary, but as a huge fan of this flavor combination in general I thought it was a really good bite. Also thought the espresso was tasty - somewhat like tiramisu in pseudo-cookie form. So yeah, I enjoyed them, even though I usually really hate anything that has a lot of frosting or icing. However, at $3.25 a pop I highly doubt I'll ever walk out with a dozen of these puppies (although the price didn't seem to stop a whole stream of people from walking in and buying just that). \n\nSecond: the mashed potato cake. So basically it's buttery mashed potatoes formed into a cutlet, sans gravy. Or, as I see it, an unadorned, un-spiced aloo tikki. It didn't look all that great on the plate by itself, and it tasted, naturally, like mashed potatoes, just slightly crispy. Now I'm a massive fan of the mashed potato, but this didn't have much flavor (whether it was lacking salt, pepper, herbs, garlic, or whatever), and I don't think it was remotely worth the $4. It wasn't bad, for sure, but still kind of the disappointing part of the meal. I'd recommend getting something else as a side.\n\nThird: The croque madame. Apparently at Essence the croque madame is meat-free, but still hearty: grain toast sandwich filled and baked with gruyere and diced tomatoes, then topped with a fried egg.  I thought this was excellent and I would order it again. The cheese and tomato were a perfect complement and the egg on top was fried just right. It doesn't look all that hearty when you first get it, but this will definitely keep you satiated for some time. And also completely negate the caffeine you had earlier. I wanted to crash so bad after this you have no idea.\n\nFourth: Samples of Bonnie G's food - a caramel macaron (tasty) and the special of the day: a Belgian waffle with strawberry-rhubarb sauce and creme fraiche. Holy crap. That was awesome.\n\nAND THUS, THE FINAL JUDGMENT\n---------------------------------------------------\nAs a well-run cafe serving organic ingredients with friendly and efficient service, I'd say Essence is a nice place with great food. Mostly because I was a big fan of the croque madame and Belgian waffle, and in spite of the somewhat disappointing mashed potato cake. The macarons were definitely tasty and I can tell Essence takes great pride in their quality, but I'd probably take a really good, hearty oatmeal raisin or chocolate chip cookie over a macaron any day. I'm a guy with a solid appetite, and thus I have some needs which airy French-style macarons can't simply fulfill (no offense to the French, Essence Bakery, or macarons). \n\nThat said, the rest of their breakfast and lunch menu looks great (from the oatmeal with flax, pecans, and soy milk to the open-faced steak sandwich) , and I definitely would eat here again. But not when I'm in a mood for some coulette steak & eggs at a tried and trusted greasy spoon. This place and its menu are too pretty for that.\n\nStill, 4 stars."""""""
5	This place is awesome!! I go here often with friends and always have a good time. The food is pretty good but the beer is why you go. My favorites are the oatmeal stout, peach ale and kiltlifter. The pumpkin porter is also good but only a seasonal flavor. This place is pretty busy at night but is a fun atmosphere to be with friends, drink and watch a ballgame. I would recommend the Tempe location far beyond the Scottsdale one as far as atmosphere and actually seeing the brewery itself.\n\nNever been disappointed here and will continue coming back!!
4	I wrote a review of this place back in mid-September and gave it only 3 stars... what the fuck was I thinking? \n\nThe food here is fucking brilliant... especially for a chain. Amazing burgers. Their Diablo Chicken pasta dish is to die for. The cornbread is actually good - I fucking hate cornbread and yet I'll scarf this shit down like it's crack. Their chips and salsas aren't that great - they'll do the job, but I'm still not convinced about them. I'm also unimpressed with the sides that come with the mains, but I don't come to this place to eat the sides. \n\nAs I've said before, their margaritas are awesome. They'll fuck you up though, so make sure you have a ride home or else go see a movie to sober up. \n\nThe atmosphere is low-end upscale and pretty nice and cozy - kinda dark inside and a bit generic, but generic is better than flashy, ugly and distracting. Service is upscale as well and I'm usually pretty pleased with it. They offer free valet parking for customers too which is perfect now that they charge an arm and a leg for the parking structure.\n\nHere's my old review for reference: \n\nGreat margaritas to be had here... really strong and tasty. This location isn't very busy ever it seems... perhaps with Fat Tuesdays around the corner, it's just too much competition.\n\nIt's a good place to grab a strong margarita before heading over to the movies or something. Their food doesn't inspire me to eat there, so all I've had are appetizers so far... mainly chips and salsa.  Salsa sucks.\n\nIt's also got some competition from Macayos down the street which doesn't help. I don't know if this place can stay in business much longer unless it gets busier. It could just be the times I was there though.
3	"""Fajitas is one of those places where you may go for an occasional, unmemorable lunch. Nothing is gross. Nothing is exceptional. Everything is just, well, there. I've tried different variations of the fajitas theme over several lunches (chicken, steak, veggie, etc.) and they were all ok. Not a big fan of their tortillas, though.\n\nIf you work anywhere near there, then I'd say go ahead. It's a safe bet for lunch. You won't puke or curse the world. But is it a joint where I'm saying, \Dude, you GOTTA try this place out\""""? Nah. You've had better fajitas elsewhere...\n\n3 Stars."""""""
2	"""This place used to be one of my favorites. A place to go when I wanted to take someone somewhere special. I loved the atmosphere, food, and service. Unfortunately, my last two visits were not so hot. Food was ok and the service sucked. Excuse my language, but I was severely disappointed. I took a group including my mother, father, and grandmother for a special brunch, a celebration. The service was just horrendous. Lots of waiting, incorrect orders, items not brought when requested. Our bill was hefty, nothing taken off for the problems we had. I received no response from management through Opentable, where I made the reservations. Sorry to say, this is no longer one of my \places\"""" to go."""""""
5	This is the best one yet (out of all of the My Sister's Closets). I've found so many yummy things here. Cashmere sweaters, designer jeans (Sevens, AG and People's Republic), Coach sandals, a Prada moon bag and some Juicy Couture dresses - and those are just the highlights. They're very picky what they accept when you consign, but that's what makes them a good consignment shop and their prices are really pretty good. I always stop here after Last Chance. It completes my shopping day and a good deal makes me happy. Forget Prozac, what we need are Prada bags for $200 (it was a super sale day - and I'm not on Prozac, just being facetious).
5	Buckle is a really cool store.  They carry both men and women's clothing and they have a huge selection of jeans.  From Silver to Lucky, they're all there!  \n\nThey also have really cute tops- from casual to dressier ones you could wear out to a club or bar.  It's nice because this store has its own style...kinda casual, a little funky, but definitely different than anything you'd find at Macy's or Nordstrom's.  \n\nThey also carry some shoes and accessories and the staff is really helpful.  You'll also get a little punch card with your first purchase and after so many punches, you'll get $10 or $15 off.\n\nThe clothes range in price, but generally, I'd say everything in the store is pretty reasonable.  This location is in Paradise Valley Mall- check it out!
5	Last Sunday I visited the club as a guest of a member.  First of all I would like to say this is the nicest health club I have ever been to in my life.  The facility is immaculate, employees are friendly and helpful, locker room has everything you would ever need and the work out room has top of the line equipment.  If I lived in Scottsdale I would get a membership asap and go there on a daily basis.  I belong to a small club in L.A. and now I feel jaded.
5	This is just about my favorite restaurant in Phoenix for casual dining. The salads are large and the best I've had anywhere. The Southwest Caesar Shrimp Salad is nearly orgasmic. The meatball sub and sausage sub are huge and delicious. The pazookie desert is just about the best thing I've ever had, and might be my last meal request on death row. The only downside is the wait, it gets REALLY busy every lunch hour and evening. No call-ahead seating either, so I tend to drive up, put my name on the list, then go shopping nearby for an hour before returning for the final ten minute wait. But yeah, it's just hard to go wrong here, everything I've had ranges from good to wow...
1	Decent food, bad service, dirty bathroom and chairs that fall apart\n\nWe decided to go here because it's right next to the museum but will never go back.\n\nThe service was bad, it looked like they didn't have enough servers on to handle the amount of tables. We never got drink refills and eventually ended up going to the bar to get them even though we had asked the server for them but he never brought any.\n\nThe picnic table we sat at was unstable and I was afraid the entire time we were there that the bench was going to break at any second. The table next to us ended up falling through their chair though, luckily no one was hurt.\n\nThe food was alright but, not good enough to go back for a second time.\n\n My boyfriend complained about the dirty bathroom. If he complained about it, it was bad!\n\nI suggest going down the street to find something better, anything will be better than here.
4	Aside from the fact that Rebecca N. is into Mike the bartender which i don't have any background on other than the review this place is delicious and to be honest the best burger ive had in a long time.  I love deluxe and also places like Stax which is good but not great (deluxe is great btw not Stax), either way the food was great not the service or annoying people next to me but i cant hold the restaurant responsible ( the people behind me made me want to stab myself in the ears with an icepick, service was crap but...)  the quality of burger was GREAT!  Its the best high quality restaurant burger ive ever had, its pricey but really worth it for a great burger.  I cant say enough about how good the burger was, me and my girlfriend whom have different tastes in burgers loved the ones we got and ate them in their entirety, which never happens we always have left overs or split it but we went for it and it was great!  If you need a burger and are tired of eating healthy its a great get away!
4	"""With the addition of Over Easy last week, 40th Street in Arcadia is becoming more and more of a hip restaurant row. Retro chairs [see photo] and space-age stools dot the interior of the cozy joint owned by Sol y Sombra chef Aaron May.\n\nThe place, which is next door to The Vig, recalls a Matt's Big Breakfast feel (and was so alluded in Java magazine) for this side of town and manages to do so in an old 1970s mission style Taco Bell. \n\nI wouldn't have been able to tell if I didn't know. Regardless, the food here is delicious and compared to other places I did not feel like I ingested a tub of butter. I ordered the hearty Wolf Pack with a pancake on the side and I was in heaven. \n\nTwo (count them, TWO!)  layers of hash browns [see photo] with two scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese and strips of bacon in the middle. The eggs were just the right consistency and hash browns were browned just right and tasted terrific with garlic salt and pepper. A fluffy griddled pancake with syrup on the side, fresh squeezed orange juice and a complimentary New York Times at the counter also greeted my morning grumpiness and I was quickly satiated.  Altogether the meal came out to $12 + tax.  A bit pricey, but worth it knowing you get what you pay for.\n\nI briefly talked with the chef's managing partner who went into detail about the tater tots with tomato jam (that I missed on the menu) and the bacon reduction sauce that comes with the brioche.\n\nMy only complaints would be minor.\n\nSmall quarters: With about half of the seats outside on the patio, it's probably a few seats more than MBB.  There was brisk business yesterday on a weekday morning, but on the weekend I can see how the crowds would grow.\n\nA la carte-like menu: This is a trend I'm not particularly fond of, especially for breakfast. Several of the entrees don't come with either eggs or potatoes. The Loretta breakfast sandwich are examples of entrees that don't come with eggs. The Over Easy brioche and omelettes don't come with potatoes. The wait staff just shrugged it off as, \Oh you can just order [blank] on the side.\""""  I disagree, especially when you're paying nearly $10 for an entre or omelette.\n\nSemi-scattered staff:  Everyone was friendly and engaged in small talk with people at the counter.  But after asking twice for my check, I figured it was a small blip in the overall experience.\n\nDelicious breakfast food with a cool hip feel? This neighborhood will be all over it.  I'm looking forward to the next visit.\n\nEDIT: 1/19/08 -- OK, I'm upping this to 4.5 stars.  Service was excellent today.  And the country fries (and tater tots with tomato jam)  were outstanding.  They were deep fried with seasoned salt, parsley...yum!"""""""
3	Back when I was meeting new people, soon after moving here from Ohio, we went here on a Friday for happy hour. I wasn't impressed then; I'm not impressed now.\n\nSylvia's reminds me of that former lover, without whom I couldn't imagine breathing much less going on with life. But after some time apart, you realize that there is more to living. And when you have them back in your life you understand that your time apart was the best time ever. Now, you think it was a mistake to ever get involved. That's how Sylvia's plays in my life. It was there at a time when I thought it was necessary but have grown to understand we were never meant to be.\n\nSorry Sylvia's. I'm taking my class ring back.
2	"""The rap on Starbucks is that they \over-roast\"""" or \""""incinerate\"""" their beans.\n\nAnd I think that might be right...sometimes at Starbucks, it seems like I'm drinking something brewed from charcoal briquettes...it doesn't taste good:(\n\nNow, I will tell you that I am really no connoisseur of coffees...I like coffee, you know...a good dark roast, made with freshly roasted beans:)\n\nBut the beans don't have to come from a specific plant , grown on the southern side of a special hill in Columbia and then eaten and pooped out by a badger of some sort.\n\nNo, I just want a decent cup of coffee at a decent price:)\n\nWhy can't Starbucks do that?\n\nI occasionally need to meet someone for business, and Starbucks comes up as meeting place (and I understand that...they are almost annoyingly ubiquitous:)\n\nI have sat at a cafe table on a street corner in San Francisco, having a cup of coffee at a Starbucks...looking at the Starbucks across the street...Lewis Black calls it \""""the place where space and time folds in on itself\""""...I say \""""why build the Hadron Super Collider to open a black hole?\""""...Starbucks did it a decade ago with a combination of charred coffee beans and vats of money to open a Starbucks for every adult in the United States:)\n\nIn and of itself, that's no reason for a 2 star review...Gordon Gecko said it best...\""""Greed is Good!\"""" and Starbucks exemplifies that credo...they are a generally very successful corporation grown up from the Bay area defectors from Peet's Coffee...I have no problem with success:)\n\nNo, my gripe with Starbucks is that they seem to be all about the marketing and not about the product...their coffee is crap:) So is most of the stuff they serve...it's second or third rate, at best.\n\nAnd just because it's convenient doesn't mean we all need to stop in.\n\nThere is better coffee and better tea and better everything around...at much better prices...it's worth looking for another meeting spot:)"""""""
4	One word to describe this place: Cutesy! Definitely dine on the outside patio, which is near the pool area. The abundance of palm trees and greenery will make you feel like you're sitting in a tropical paradise. I loved the setting!\n\nWe were at a nearby spa and decided to drop into this restaurant, which is located the Firesky Resort, for lunch one afternoon. \n\nThe food: Average. I had the turkey panini, which turned out good, but friends ordered the tuna panini, which didn't turn out that great. Luckily, the restaurant happily took the tuna sandwiches back and gladly offered a replacement for my friends. We also ordered a pizza margherita, which was the size of a large pizza -- definitely a dish for sharing. Oh, and don't skip dessert! The tiramisu was just divine!\n\nBonus props to Firesky Resort for offering to shuttle us back to our hotel free of charge in their private car, when we asked them to call us a cab. LOVED the service at this restaurant/hotel!\n\nSummed up: 3 stars for the overall food quality and taste, but an added 4th star for the exceptional service at the restaurant/hotel, and the marvelous dessert!
4	"""A long time ago, Rigatony's was a Golden Corral. Thankfully Golden Corral went out of business and Rigatony's moved in.\n\nI'm hitting broken record level here, but the oft-repeated \Olive Garden but better\"""" is pretty accurate. Good Italian-American fare with a large, varied menu. Special requests don't scare them, the service is great, and the food is tasty and hot whether you're dining in or taking out. A lot of places just dump your food into containers; Rigatony's packages everything carefully so it stays its best and an appropriate temperature. (And they fill your salads so full the takeout boxes hardly close.)\n\nThe salad is damn near the best salad ever, and if you don't save room for dessert you're really missing out. \n\nBEWARE THE PARKING. Rigatony's is packed just about every night for dinner and packed to the gills on weekends. If you're driving a large vehicle (or just aren't comfortable in cramped lots), consider parking on the street. It's a decent neighborhood, and there's enough activity I don't think I've ever heard of anyone getting broken into."""""""
3	Honestly, this place isn't anything exceptionally special. I expected it to be a bit more upscale for the Arizona Center, but it reminded me of your run-of-the-mill Mexican places you can find everywhere. \nNow don't get me wrong, it was delicious for a lunchtime choice and I'm glad I went because it was tasty but I just wouldn't go back.\nFor one, the salsa was very chunky. Chunky in a way that it was all tomato, cilantro, onions, etc. But the chips served with were interesting in the fact that they were always hot out of the oven and were long tomale-like shapes rather than poured out of a bag.\nI got the Lunch Special #18 and my friends got #20 and #22. Whichever is the chulopa, get that one! Mine was just an enchilada with rice and beans and although it was the cheaper option on the menu, it wasn't exciting. \nI would recommend this place is you're craving just some basic Mexican food and don't have a long lunch hour. I would ALSO suggest this place for HH. I didn't get to drink but they're specials looked bomb!
1	The last time I was in Phoenix I had a business dinner here and ordered their wings and then some special meal (included salad, chicken and something else).  The place was empty and the waitress was actually bothered we had chosen to eat dinner in her section.  To make a long story short - I got sick that night with some type of food poisoning and spent the next 12 hours trying to sleep between throwing up and running a fever.  Will definitely never go back.
4	Bangarang!\n\nNot only does Lollicup serve boba, tea and other assorted Asian drinks. But they also have a wide assortment of inexpensive food.  \n\nWhen you walk into a this place you realize that it must be authentic.  It is always full of real live Asian people who are having the time of their lives.  It is like walking into an Italian restaurant and seeing the entire cast of the Sopranos.  Sure you might be a little scared at first but in your heart you know that you are in for a treat/adventure, or a treatventure according to the word I just made up.\n\nI got the Thai Iced tea and The Steam Pork buns.  I have only had better Thai iced tea at the Thai Hut in Phoenix, but in all fairness that was after a night long bender in which one of my friends may have gained carnal knowledge of a melon. So it really is not fair to compare seeing as how my mind was already blown that day.\nThe Steamed Pork Buns were amazing. They do take a little while longer to make than normal. But when you cram that much awesome into a little bun thing it is best not to rush.\n\nThey also have an assortment of games that you can play while waiting or eating.  More places need to have games available. You here me Rose and Crown?  I want to play games!\n\nThere is a Bigfoot like rumor about free Wi-Fi here as well.  This has yet to be tested.  I will assemble a crack team of battleship playing nerds to asses this claim as soon as possible.  Stay Tuned.
4	A friend and I went to Zinburger for restaurant week and I am so grateful I finally got to try this place out.  When arriving I thought we might have a long wait but we had just the right amount of time we grabbed a beer at the bar and watched the game right about halfway done they called us for our table.  \n\nWe had both checked out the menu online so we knew what we wanted.  I ordered the Zinburger which had Manchego Cheese, Zinfandel Braised Onions & Mayo.  I got it medium rare and it was amazing.  The juices were dribbling down my arms and it was messy just like a real burger should.  We both got fries to share one order of sweet potato and one of the double truffle.  The sweet potato fries were good but the dipping yogurt was just ok.  Tasted a lot like tzatziki sauce.  The double truffle fries were really good we finished them all.  \n\nFor the dessert I had the Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Shake that had Vanilla Ice Cream, Madagascar Vanilla Bean, Fresh Cream & Crushed Caramel.  OMG that was my heaven in a glass.  That is one of my favorite desserts and turning that into drinkable goodness I was very happy.  \n\nI left in a total food coma and can't wait to go back again.  The service was on point and the food was great as well.
2	Cheba Hut. I think this place is okay. The pokalolo was my favorite sandwich. I have gone into this place many times, but always felt like something was either missing or needed to change. I don't think I ever really picked up on what that thing was. I will say that there is a lot of people who love this place. \n\nI think it is a bit overrated and got tired of the whole weed theme behind it. I also felt slightly disgusted by some of the people who made my sandwiches there (taking a shower is too mainstream for some of them).
5	Vaughan's Southwest Custom Tours saved our vacation!\n\nWhen our tour company cancelled on us last minute (literally 5pm on Sunday before our Monday Grand Canyon tour), we were nearly inconsolable.  After all, we'd planned a trip to Phoenix expressly to see the Grand Canyon and Monday was the only day we could do an all day tour!  Luckily, after making some calls, we were incredibly lucky to snag the last two spots on a tour with Vaughan's!\n\nOur tour guide, Tim, picked us up from our hotel lobby promptly at 7am, and we were off!  The scenery was captivating and ever changing on the way to the canyon.  The entire way, Tim kept up an interesting commentary about the history, the culture and the flora and fauna of Arizona.  \n\nThere were plenty of bathroom breaks along the way.  We stopped about an hour and a half in for coffee and then continued another few hours to reach a Navajo trading post, where we had a tasty lunch and a chance to see some genuine reservation-made crafts.  I found the prices and quality to be better than Scottsdale/Phoenix, so you may want to hold off on purchases until you see the stuff at the trading post!\n\nThere was an accident in front of the Park entrance that wound up costing us quite a bit of time, but Tim was a consummate professional and still made sure that we had plenty of time at the park even though it added about 2 hours to his workday.  He took us to the best parts of the park and even pointed out some wildlife.  It was absolutely gorgeous, and we even got to see sunset in the Grand Canyon, which was a real treat!\n\nPARTING THOUGHT: If you are trying to decide on a tour company for the Grand Canyon, look no further!  Vaughan's Southwest Custom Tours is extremely reliable with knowledgeable guides, comfortable vans and competitive prices.
1	"""Let me start off by saying that I have never written a review before, but this place made me so upset that I had to. I have a 2 year old semi-aggressive rottweiler who needed to be spayed. I forewarned them when I made the appointment that she would be nervous but I would leave her in the car until they called us back and I would have a muzzle on her. The first tech was nice and understanding and my dog seemed to like her. We had the whole back area to ourselves so my dog would feel more comfortable, which was a plus. The tech understood that my dog was nervous but was gentle with her, and that made me and my dog more at ease. THEN the vet came in and said, \Why does she have that muzzle on her face?!\"""" I stated the obvious and said, \""""Because she can get a little aggressive if she feels nervous.\"""" The vet decided that she would do her exam after she sedated her and i agreed. Instead of trying to gently approach my dog and pet her to gain her trust, she and a different vet tech decided it would be best to crowd over her, and then grab her and hold her down. My nervous dog didn't understand and decided it would be best to fight. She had her muzzle on, but she still was extremely frightened and did not understand what these people were doing. The vet then proceeded to poke my dog with a needle and repeatedly try to inject a sedative. That failed and instead made my dog bleed everywhere and make her scared of the staff. They put her in a kennel, not sedated. Then the vet proceeded to lecture me about my prong collar! (Which I ONLY use in situation like this and it works great for strong dogs if you know how to use it PROPERLY) Ohh and she hates prong collars, and I SHOULD BE using a \""""gentle leader\"""" instead. I would LOVE to have her walk my dog with a gentle leader in a situation like that! Either way, I shouldn't have to explain myself to a vet who is supposed to only take care of my spay. She also tried to refer me to a behaviorist that she knows. (Let me also add in that when I took my dog to my actual vets office, she did not act this way, was loving to the staff, and I took off her prong collar and muzzle and they were able to do a FULL exam without a sedative.....because the staff was actually knowledgeable on how to handle nervous/aggressive dogs.) Before i left, i made sure to sign my dog up to have her nails clipped because they had never been clipped before because she doesn't like when people grab her paws. (I was most excited for this, because they do it while shes sleeping, and it was much needed!) I also said she could get her rabies vaccine, but that was it. I planned on taking both of my dogs to my vet to do vaccines at the same time, and a thorough check up. After I left, later in the afternoon, i got a call from the vet and I was on speaker phone, \""""Hi, I hope you can hear me, I have your dog on the table right now!!! I saw that you aren't getting her distemper/parvo vaccine, and I need you to reconsider! I cannot stress how important it is and bla blah blah for the next five minutes.\"""" I was shocked to receive this call at home with my dog on the table and I had already denied the test! Instead, I felt pressured and agreed and said fine, just do that too. When I came to pick her up with my boyfriend I asked the receptionist how things went. She said the surgery was fine but when they tried to go in her kennel and sedate her for the second time, she went after them. She proceeded to tell me that all of the staff had made repeated attempts to inject her with a sedative, but she wouldn't have it. Finally, the vet cornered her and got it done. (She tells me this with a smile.)  I was so upset that my dog had to have this completely traumatic experience at a \""""vet's office.\"""" I went to pay and the bill was a little more than expected, I asked why, and she claims that  my dog was in heat! I found this funny, because my dog just got out of heat about two months prior,and we waited for it to finish to schedule this appointment. They find any way to squeeze a dime out of you! They took me back to get my dog, and she was in a kennel that had a big sticker on it that said, \""""CAUTION\"""" and she had poop all over her butt. They honestly couldn't clean her up while sedated? She couldn't even get up for god's sake! After we got her home, we looked at her nails, and they barely clipped them, and didn't clip her two back paws at all! I am so mad at myself for putting my dog through that bad experience, and for giving them any of my money. If you truly care for your dog, then pay the extra money and take them to your vet with whom they are comfortable and familiar with. The North Phoenix Spay and Neuter Clinic should only be dealing with cats and puppies. The staff cares more about the money than the animals. Remember that having this major surgery is a scary experience for dogs in the first place, so take them to someone who actually cares about them."""""""
2	For what it is, cheap easy family friendly food with a bit of a yuppie bend, its not bad.\n\nBut they messed up a grilled cheese sandwich.\nHow do you do that? My mom, god bless her, can't cook to save her life. None the less, she can still make a pretty damn good grilled cheese.\n\nIts not rocket science. Let me walk Sauce through this:\n- Cut slices of cheese. Precut is pretty gross.\n- Put bread around cheese.\n- Apply butter to the outside.\n- Grill til melted.\n\nYet, my girlfriend's grilled cheese was horrible. Bad bread, thin on the cheese, and it tasted like heated cat turds.\n\nI'm just not that impressed. I know lots of you love this place, but I don't for the life of me know why.\n\nIt would have been 1 star, but the mac n' cheese bought it an extra star. \n\nWhy is it so hard to find good pizza in Phoenix. You'd think with its mob proximity to Las Vegas that it'd have better Italian food. And yet, not so much. I blame the Mormon influence on this town. Too many years of Kraft products and special underwear have really killed the food talent here.
1	As the ONLY service company and installer for Kinetico Water Softener Systems in the Phoenix area - I would highly DISCOURAGE one from using this company or purchasing a system from them. After purchasing a house with an old (13+ year) Kinetico water system, we were well aware that our system could be a money pit - however were assured by each of the 3 service reps that came to fix it that it would last us many more years with a simple fix. After spending $700 last year on service, the system flooded our just emptied septic tank (costing us another $660) and the company is now claiming that we should purchase a new one ($3500). And when I called to speak to the manager he basically said I should have been standing over my water softener system to ensure that it was working properly, offered no apologies and no responsibility for the fact that the $700 spent last year was no fix at all. Save your cash and buy a cheaper system with a company that understands service.
4	I haven't been to Timo in a few months, so I was excited to come back for our twin mom's night out. When we got there, they already had our table set up.  I am usually the first one, hey, I need a drink, but this time there were a few other moms already there.  We ended up having a table for 15.  Our server, Alexis was very nice and efficient.  I shared a couple of things with one of my friends.  Timo offers a great deal on Mondays, a bottle of wine and flatbread pizza for $19, an incredible deal.  I had to share the bottle, as much as I like my wine, I can't drink a whole bottle by myself.  I had a carb overload night, it was delicious.  I had not had carbs in about 4 weeks, so I could feel the bloat before finishing my last bite, but it was so worth it.  One of my friends had a delicious cocktail made with pineapple infused vodka, muddled mint and lavender.  It was very refreshing.  Last time I was there, the menu was a lot smaller, I am happy to see a great variety and food looked delicious.  I can't wait to come back.
4	I never thought I would get a brazilian.  My worst fear was the pain.  Well, I am not going to lie, it is not painless, but it is tolerable.  I try to take a couple of ibuprofen before I go.  Emma and Rachel are wonderful.  They make you feel at ease while you are spread eagle on the table.  The wax they use is not as hot and I love how sanitary it is.  No double dipping on the wax.
3	By far not my favorite place, but others seem to love it.  Stopped here for dinner last night.  Chips and salsa are average, prices are high.  Best thing to me on the menu is the carne asada, but it costs about $17 for the meal so I don't get it often.  Had the combo #2 and have to say I liked it.  The beef taco was good, and the ground beef enchilada wasn't too bad either.  Think the plate was about $10, and came with a side of rice, but no beans.   They have made some changes to the decor since I was last there, but still think that the food is average at best.  I will say that even as busy as they were, food came out pretty fast which is great when you have hungry kids.  FYI - parking sucks.
3	"""This place is called T Roosevelts now. We were there on a Sunday afternoon and were the only people in there. Not a good sign. We got a coupon for a free appetizer and got the spinich dip. It was typical. We had a corned beef slider...good but a tad salty. Then we shared the prime rib dip. It was so good with gardinera on it! Hand cut fries were good, too. We decided on banana crepes for dessert. Yuck!! The \bananas\"""" were actually plantains with no flavor. The crepes were super thick, almost pancake-like. They ran out of tomato juice, no bloody mary,  so my friend and I decided on sangria. The 1st one was good but 2nd was tooooo sweet. The server was fine, although he never told us his name. Also, the kitchen was open so you could see the cook on his phone the whole time he made our lunch. Very unprofessional in my opinion."""""""
1	Went here for a weekend getaway. Deal was too good resort credit equal to the room rate.....good right....well not so much. \n\nArrival- very dated facilities I'd say circa 1980. Key card didn't open door back to lobby we go. 1st room right next to main stairwell and elevator with kids running up and down it....new room please.\n\nSecond room....burn holes in the carpet, bathroom was in a word gross.\n\nOther comments....one pool...that's it. One tiny pool for everyone at the resort.\n\nCalled the front desk said we'd like to cancel our reservation as the resort does not meet our expectations. Thank God they did because I was prepared for a fight. \n\nIf I could give this palce 0 starts I would. Old and disgusting.
5	The red curry chicken is delicious!\n\nThis is a great lunch spot. It's in an old converted diner, so it has a very unique feel to it. I cozied up to the bar, and was happy to have hot, tasty soup and an egg roll immediately placed in front of me when they brought me a menu. For a drink I ordered an iced tea, which was a flavored brew, not your run-of-the-mill fare often served at quick lunch spots.\n\nThe red curry chicken is delicious! Oh, did I already say that? The main course was served extremely promptly, and the entire dish was wonderful. Great cuts of chicken, mouth-watering sauce, fresh vegetables. \n\nI was really impressed with the speed of service, too, which would make this a great spot to hit if you need a great meal in a hurry.
3	This place has been around for a long time. Ever since I lived in Phoenix it was here and I know it was here at least 20 years before that. So I think it is safe to say it has been here 50 years plus.\nIt used to be called Christown Mall, which I actually like better. \nThe parking is a bit on the crazy side here. As if it is the only mall in town. Which of course it is not.\nThey do have a lot of stores inside. Penney's being one of the main ones. There is a few name brand chains in here,but mostly one hit wonders.\n It is on the less expensive side as well. The clientele can be a bit shady at times.\nAs they say in New York, ladies watch your purses. \n They used to have Santa Claus there which I liked when my kids were small , plus the giving tree, but in the last few years,no.\nI still go here, they have a Pets Mart, Costco, Target, and Walmart.   Walgreens, radio Shack and so on.\nit is not all bad, But, I am always on guard when I am there. Which does not make my shopping day pleasant.
4	One of the best bundt cakes or cake in general around.  The cream cheese frosting really makes this cake.  The cake is moist but the frosting just knocks it out of the park.  I usually get the mini cake or if you can get the baby bundts which are bite sized and always a big hit at parties.  They come in beautiful party box and could not be tastier expressions of your affection.  Always serve the cake room temperature but I do pick up a couple at a time and put them in the fridge or freeze them if they last that long.  Of course they are on the sweet side, it is cake after all, but worth every bite.  They are a perfect treat to share with that special someone (you have to really really like them though to share these tasty guys) but when I don't feel like baking I'll make the drive to this friendly store and pick up as many as I can.\nThe lemon poppy seed is beautifully balanced.  Red Velvet is a crowd pleasure, but my favorite is the carrot cake.  Ribbons of cream cheese frosting gild the lily on a cake that it not too heavily spiced and not too healthy tasting.  Hungry just thinking about it...
4	I wish I had only eaten the pizza here and nothing else, because then I could give a completely positive review.  I've eaten here several times, and most of them have been fabulous!  \n\nI'll give my bad experience first.  I once ordered a pasta with shrimp in it, and the shrimp was completely overcooked -- to the point of being chewy. Yuck.\n\nNow on the good!  The pizza from this place is awesome!  I always order the same one -- prosciutto and artichoke -- so I can't talk about any others.  The prosciutto and artichoke pizza is absolutely delicious -- always!  I always call ahead and just in run in get it so I can take it home and devour it in the privacy of my home.  I'm glad my daughter thinks artichokes are gross, because that just means more pizza for me!  Pair it with a nice glass of wine and a movie, and I have my very own date night (clearly I'm speaking from experience)!  \n\nI would put that prosciutto and artichoke pizza up against any pizza from Pizzeria Bianco any day!
2	Why bother to ask what kind of sauce I want for nuggets at the time of order if you aren't going to add them to my bag at the drive-thru window. Not just isolated either, its EVERY time.  I always have to remind them about the sauces even though its on my order ticket.  I can't even remember a time when they got my order 100% correct.  Took my son there today.  Time was around 2pm so not busy at all.  Went through the drive thru.  Ordered a mighty kids meal for a BOY and when asked what kind of sauce for his nuggets I specified sweet n sour.  Also ordered a #1 combo with diet coke.  Think thats a pretty simple and straight foward order right? Well of course I get to the window and no sauce in the bag so I ask for the girl for some sauce.  Hand my son his mighty meal and he freaks out because they gave him a princess toy!  This is not good!  So I have to now park and go inside just to swap the darn toy!  I sure hope that management reads these reviews so they can make the changes needed.
4	"""A tree grows in Peoria, uh I mean Brooklyn.  A Brooklyn deli settled in Peoria of all places?  WTF is that all about?   \n\nIt's savvy business sense is what it is.  This corner of the Valley is starved for a New York / Italian deli - and from the throng of a lunch-time crowd I think my hunch is right.  This Denver-based deli is new to town, but is taking the Arrowhead area and this Golds Gym strip mall by storm.  If you get there between 12-1 you're looking at a wait about 10 people deep. \n\nNERD-ALERT ADVERTISING ASIDE\nYou might recall the two-stage clever billboard campaign about a year ago with with a UPS packaged look to it simply messaged with the words \Something is coming from Brooklyn.\"""" A ripped corner on the billboard a few weeks later revealed the logo and location.  Ok now, back to the review.\n\nI had heard about the bread here, but didn't take those comments too seriously.  I swear to God.  I have never seen bread so huge, fluffy and decadent.  These freshly-baked loaves sit at the counter taunting would-be customers with their beauty and scrumptiousness.   The marble rye roll was as big as my face.  The sourdough, wheat and white slices must be an INCH AND A HALF THICK!  You walk up to the counter, place your order with your own sandwich maker - which Heidi's has at about 10 staff members deep!\n\nThe sandwich selections are typical of New York or Italian delis and the feel of the place with its clubby dark wood booth atmosphere there evokes Brooklyn alright.  I've had the Transplanted New Yorker and Cajun Turkey Avocados sandwiches.   The TNY comes with five Italian meats, provolone and a spicy chipotle aioli.  Holy crap was that sauce HOT.  I mean, I like my food spicy, but I got a big wad of that in one bite, and WOWEE it made me wince a bit.  Another more popular sandwich there (which I want to try next time) is Hells Kitchen - which silly me, I thought was a trendy Manhattan nabe.  The HK is egg salad, bacon, swiss, avocado and the spicy sauce.   Sounds weirdly decadent yet tasty all at once.  The best named item would have to be the \""""Make Your Own, But Don't Be a Pain in the Ass\"""" Wrap - a more clever way to put it, eh?\n\nIf you're a Nathan's Famous hot dog fan, you can get your fix for that here too.   They don't mess around when it comes to portions - with meats on the heavy side.  But at $7 each the sandwiches aren't cheap either.   So you get what you pay for here.   The desserts are similarly fresh-baked, huge and delicious -- having had both the 5-inch square brownies and cookies.  I spied a delicious cannoli here, so keep that in mind too. \n\nAfter $9 and change you've got yourself some good deli grub, and probably might consider yourself a newly devout fan -- like I do.\n\nYes folks.  A tree grows in Brooklyn.  And a Brooklyn deli now grows in Peoria.\n\nP.S. Biltmore and Downtown locations are opening later this year."""""""
1	"""I am a dive bar expert.  I love me a good dive bar.  The darker and older the better.  The surly regulars on the fringes of society are my people.\n\nThis place is shit.  Not 'The Shit'.  Actual shit, as in a piece of crap.\n\nWe ordered wings, after the bartender bragged how they were the best in town, and the regulars started laughing about how they just cooked a bunch of fish they caught locally in the frier, and that our wings were gonna taste fishy.  Not in a \we're fuckin' with you\"""" way, but more of a \""""we have no sense of self\"""" way.\n\nHomo say what!?!?\n\nThey did taste fishy!  We each ate only one.  Everyone was having a great time about it.  We left an entire plate of uneaten wings, and nobody gave a shit.  Fine, no problem.  \n\nWe finished our beers and left.\n\nEven if the wings weren't trouty, they were way too big.  Bigger isn't better in the case of wings.  They aren't actually buffalo wings, and shouldnt resemble some bloated and abused fictional beast.  They should be from chickens.  SMALL CREATURES CALLED CHICKENS.\n\n\nThe end."""""""
1	yogis is to sushi/japanese as panda express is to chinese.\n\ni have been in here twice. the first time the service was alright, and the food was lackluster. the rolls were small and looked nothing like the ones plastered all over the wall. they were served in a styrofoam box. the second time i went in the food was even worse. the girls in the back were chatting while i waited up front for about 2 minutes to order. she was extremely unpleasant. it took them about 5 minutes to make my simple teryaki bowl which was filled with little, thin, fatty strips of dark meat and topped with [yuck] green onions. the sauce was alright. not even siracha could help this bowl.\n\ndisgusting.
5	A wonderful new option for lunch in Scottsdale!\nI stopped in on their second day open and my experience was flawless. It was a Thursday and the special was Italian Beef with Au Jus. I had to try it. I ordered the half size for ($4.25) and it was plenty.\nIt arrived piping hot with melted mozzarella on really great Italian bread. The Jus was the best I've had outside of my ma's kitchen and the sandwich was perfection. The beef was so tender with no bits of fat.\nThe restaurant is small and clean. The owners are the real deal. They were making sure everything was just right. \n\nI am so excited to have this wonderful option for lunch with a great price point ($4.25 - $9.95) and amazing food. They have daily specials that are awesome.
5	Hands down the best restaurant we had on our Memorial Day vacation. \n\nAfter recovering from a day in the Salt River and a heavy night of drinking our friends all being ASU Alumni decided to take us to Four Peaks, which in a nut shell they said its the BJ's of Tempe but better. We'll see about that my friend.....\n\nCame in and it was pretty packed already, with the sun going down after a huge Laker victory (that's right I said it :D) I'm sure the people in there were drinking away their sorrows as yet again the Suns fail to proceed to the Finals. But enough NBA drama, we were seated towards the back where it literally resembled a warehouse. We're talking about pallets with hops, and giant steel brewing machines brewing up the house beers. \n\nOur friends recommended the Peach Brew Beer which had a very strong peach taste to it but still a pretty interesting taste. A buddy and I split of pitcher of it before placing our orders. I decided to go with the French Dip tonight with fries. The sandwich came out split perfectly in half with cheese laced throughout the tender meat, I was salivating at this point. \n\nThe Au Jus was hot and salty, very good, I took my first bite and literally a scream of joy exited my mouth as I was trying to chew. One of THE best French Dip's I've had in a long long time. I made sure all of my friends took a bite to confirm my theory. \n\nI definitely will be coming back for ASU football games this season and will make damn sure that I visit Four Peaks again :)
1	Tried it a few times.  Hardly a warm welcome from the young girl up front. Thought I'd give it another chance since I love how close it is it my home, only to find out that when they say they are open at 7am, it's a tentative 7am.  I didn't want to drive around looking for another dry cleaner so (like an idiot) I waited till 7:30 and still no one.   Needless to say, it's time for a new dry cleaner.
1	There is nothing simple about this airport. Security sucks. if you are connecting from one airline to another, you have to go through securtiy again. and they don't care how short a window is for  your connection. \nIf you have to go to another terminal to connect, there are no signs to tell you which airlines are in which terminal. Employees are not helpful. \n\nI hate this airport. I would rather have a root canal than to fly into/connect through sky harbor.
1	Go to this McDonald's locations drive-thru and order 3 things.... chocolate shake, vanilla cone but in a cup - for my boys and fries.  When I got to the window to get my food nothing was ready... you mean with 3 people in the restaurant your staff can't get this ready? Then I look up and realize there is one person already pulled over waiting for what they ordered which ended up being one of their iced coffees. Manager finally comes out with my shake and the boys ice cream, forgets the fries and a straw.  You are a manager? Really? Are you that out of touch? Did you just bring me a shake and no straw and totally forget my fries.  I guess you just can't fix stupid.  I will NEVER go to this location again. Reading the other reviews this store seems to have an evil twin, one really good at what they do the other they just can't get their crap together.
3	Tons of TV's & a good menu of bar food. We went here to watch a NW college football game and eat/drink before the Territorial Cup at ASU. The draft beer selection is just okay but there are a ton of TV's so you can get whatever game you want on a conveniently placed screen. As a California native I'm always a little weirded out by bars imitating a California beach bar outside of California, like Tavern on Mill, but at least this bar supports the Chargers. The crowd at the bar seemed full of tools & bro ho's but I'm not sure if that's the bar or if that's just the ASU football game crowd. The place was practically empty when we got there around 1 pm but completely full by 5:30 (7:30 ASU-AZ game). I had:\n\n- Spicy Caesar Salad: Decently fresh but rather small. The menu doesn't say it but the salad comes with a mini quesadilla which was a nice addition. I thought the dressing was yucky and would recommend just using some salsa instead.\n- Taco: I subbed black beans in for the meat and overall it was a good taco. Nothing special but not bad either. It comes with unremarkable chips,\n- Mozzarella Sticks: Normal mozzarella sticks with good marinara sauce. If you're looking for an app to share I would recommend the nachos instead.\n- Tater Tots: Love bars that have tater tots because they are never bad.
4	"""Whenever the fellow jurors plan to grab coffee (Starbucks is at the bottom level of the court house), I get all sweet and doe eyed and uppity state \oh no, let's support a local biz instead!\"""" and we've bounced around a few coffee places since.\n\nI get girly caramel or mocha nonfat lattes, and they are good.  I THINK the pricing is better than Starbucks (after all, how would I know? :D), plus the Yelp checkin deal is really nice if this trial goes WAY TOO LONG (Day 6 so far).\n\nI would of thought this place was a corporate empire, if it was not for the Yelp reviews.

2	"""Spent a casual afternoon in the area and decided to stop by Culinary Dropout for a light bite and a glass o wine. Weekday afternoon - not busy at all. We decided on a seat outdoors. Our server brought out the menu, took our drink order and we asked for a few more minutes to fill out the fun \sushi-like\"""" menu to design our very own antipasti. Waited a really long time for our server to return, my hubby had to go chase down the waiter. We finally ordered one meat, one cheese, some grilled asparagus and bread and olive oil. TONS of bread and very little of everything else. Not great or over the top ingredients - we could have done better at AJ's or Whole Foods. All in all, very poor service and more talk than walk on the food. Don't think we'll go back to try anything else as it was pricey for what we got and again, the service sukt."""""""
1	My friend and i drove 25 miles to get to a yoga class at 2:00pm, we get there 5 minutes late and they did not let us in.  We did all we could to get there on time and the lady at the front desk asked us to leave and to arrive on time next time.  \n\nI asked her since we drove such a long way to come to this place can we get in?  She still said no.  I felt so hurt at all the effort we put in.  She was looking at us funny because I am Mexican and my friend is Black.  We have both practiced yoga for a while now.\n\nSince then, I will not got back due to poor customer response.  I will not recommend this place to any of my friends.
1	My son and I love frozen yogurt and U-Swirl had always been one of our favorites because of its good selection. When we went in yesterday it was a bit disheartening because the tattoo -headed man at the register seemed like he was doing us a favor ringing us up. No greeting,  thank you, smile or small talk. Thought maybe he was just  having a bad day until he went out of his way to be overly friendly to the single man he rang up next. Maybe they just dont like kids. Kind of sad for a yogurt shop though.
5	I can't say much about this place because I do the same damned thing every time.  Pull up to the drive through window, smile at the nice lady, order a teriyaki combo or two and some rolls, and peel out with my food in two minutes or less.\n\nI can't imagine it's the toughest thing in the world to make consistently good teriyaki, but I'll tell you what, those people are friendly every damned time I roll through.  And the food is always still hot and delicious when I plop down on my sofa to dig in.  Oh, and the salad dressing for the combo salad is yum.  God, I think this place might have been around back when I was in high school.  Way to keep it rolling!  Five stars, baby!
5	This is Tempe's greatest kept lunch spot secret.  \n\nThe food is always super fresh and delicious.  The service is awesome and its family owned.  They also use a lot of local fresh food.  For example, they get their hoagies fresh daily from an Italian deli nearby.  And it's some of the best bread I've ever had.\n\nI've tried everything on the menu and I've been a regular for several years.  If I had to recommend one thing on the menu it'd be the Italian Cheesesteak (add mayo, lettuce, tomato to make it 'hoagie style').  They grill that bad boy up fresh every time.  The soups are great too, my favorite is a tie between the Albondigas and Broccoli Cheese.  My wife enjoys the tuna or turkey.  You can't go wrong, check it out!
4	I saw the really great reviews for this place in Yelp and decided I had to try this place. Honestly this might be the best budget Asian Buffet I've ever been to. Some of the items I've tried were far better and more delicious than what I can get at the four closest Chinese sit down Restaurants to where I live. I'm not saying this is the best Chinese food anywhere but I'm just saying most of what I tried was better than what I can get near me and most of what I took was very good. I note I DON'T KNOW if they were just having a good day or if they are like this all the time or not since I fear endorsing any budget Chinese Buffet.\n\nThis new Buffet has over 150 items and is DIRT CHEAP as they charge $7.99 for lunch and 9.99 for dinner Monday threw Thursday and the weekend 10.99. On their website they say crab legs are included on the weekend but during the week they charge you for optional crab legs $1.49 a 1/2 Lb. and $2.49 a Lb. Drinks are extra.\n\nWhen we walked in the servers were VERY WELCOMING and friendly. The place  seemed clean and is cute and has a slightly different look.\n\nOf course I couldn't try everything but I did take a variety of stuff. I note this is the very first budget Asian Buffet I've been to where the salmon was actually edible and not funky tasting and dried out. The salmon was moist fresh and tasty and was a shocker for me. The chicken and broccoli was actually delicious and so was the yummy Asian Eggplant dish. I would have loaded up my plate differently if I was aware these were so good. They had flounder on this buffet and it really was flounder and not some mystery fish. Nothing I tried was oily. Someone can actually cook here and make some good food.\n\nOnly a few things I tried I didn't care for such as their tempura dipped vegetables as it had too much flour in it. Also they had a large variety of sushi and most were passable but not all I thought. Not the greatest sushi but better than the packaged supermarket sushi. Desserts aren't so special but you can take fruit. \n\nWhy hasn't Yelp's Buffet Guy Rand been here yet?\n\n This place seems like a winner!
3	I can't resist a new Thai restaurant that comes across my path. Thus, I had to try the new Thai Orchid Garden that recently opened a few doors down from my favorite salon (Bella Rouge). \n\nTwo other friends and I went to Thai Orchid for dinner a few nights ago. They were already seated when I arrived. I parked and approached the door, and an older gentleman was sitting out front smoking a cigarette, which immediately turned me off. He started talking to me, greeted me, and opened the door to the restaurant. Ahh ... he worked there.\n\nTurns out he more than worked there - he was the owner. He walked past our booth and sat down in the booth behind us. The smell of cigarette smoke was overwhelming. \n\nAfter a while, the odor dissipated, and our waitress took our order. I had my old standby, Pha-Nang curry with beef. Cara had the Pad Thai, and Jenny had some kind of chicken and eggplant dish. \n\nMy dish was wonderful. We all devoured our meals and enjoyed each other's company. The only times I felt less than thrilled was once when I asked the waitress for more rice - she looked at me like I was crazy but then brought more rice - and when the owner came back over to our table and started passing out his business card. We were in the middle of a conversation, and he had interrupted ... it was just weird. \n\nWill I go back? Yep. The food was good. But, more likely, I'll place an order to go when I'm over at Bella Rouge and then enjoy my Pha-Nang at home!
3	bahahahaha I love the comment about the cougars. My friend and I had the exact same observation.\n\n I have been twice, the first time was the best. we had the perfect spot on the patio. We ordered one of their pizzas (really tasty) and the hummus (decent). It was nice to just enjoy the atmosphere and the food. We split so it wasn't very costly and was the perfect portion.\n\nThe 2nd time it was bit more costly and not really worth it. I had the bacon wrapped pork (really yum) and my friend ordered the scallops (he said they were too salty and not worth the money).\n\nSo, basically, my review is eat here when you want a great patio and view and split an appetizer and course. otherwise, it's not really worth the money.
5	I was there for dinner, got there around 7:00 pm, and this place was packed. I sit at sushi bar right in front of a chief who I believe is the owner. I ordered Okinawa Soba, which I think not too many people order that, so it might take some time for them to cook. I was waiting for about 10 - 15 minutes, the chief gave me some beans to chew on to kill time. I was impressed.\nI would suggest to make reservation or at least call to make sure that you don't need to wait for a table.
5	Coming from LA, I am familiar with La Grande Orange in Pasadena. However, I never had their pizzas until I visited this little shop in Phoenix. It was delicious and the novelty and combination of taste - AMAZING! Between the 3 of us, we ordered:\n\nMushroom pizza: Pretty good, lots of 'shrums for those who like mushrooms\nCorn and Avocado: Now that was delicious covered with chunks of goat cheese! I love goat cheese, tastes almost like cream cheese :)\nThe Gladiator pizza: Pretty much an all meat pizza\nThe Tomato and Basil: Yum\n\nThey even have vegetarian options for those who don't eat meat. It's a great late night snack. I don't usually eat the crust but they made it so well that I wasn't picky about it. \n\nOh, and we also ordered chicken wings - it was alright but I would say stick to the pizzas.
5	I LOVE Penzey's.  My entire spice cabinet is from their shop.  The quality is excellent, they carry things you can't get anywhere else, and they have amazing spice blends for almost every occasion.  I do agree with Dan that the store should have longer hours now that it is in Tempe Marketplace, but for me the convenience of having their store so close is worth the inconvenience of the hours.\n\nI'm telling you, once you try Penzey's you'll never go back to the stuff at the supermarket, and frankly there is no need.  The prices are not that different and the quality is light years better.
3	This is DEFINITELY a bar - not a restaurant.  I wish I'd read the small print a bit better before hauling my family there on a Friday for happy hour.  Was definitely dark and we were a bit put off by being pounced upon immediately for fundraising raffle (before our drink order); though I will say kudos, the waitress came by right away with a big smile ready to please.  I would definitely go back here, but make no mistake, it is DEFINITELY a dive, but looks like a FUN one, and I am looking forward to trying the food... \n\nAlmost forgot - there was MINIMAL seating left by the time we arrived, a Friday at appx 5ish.  Two round tables with four chairs a piece and then TWO HUGE TABLES were reserved for some private party.  So.. we'd have to sit at the bar which my senior citizen mother was not going to be doing.
1	"""Its official, Biancos has \jumped the shark\"""".  We used to eat at his place when he was in a strip mall on Camelback and watched his business \""""grow\"""" to what it is now.   I jokingly say \""""grow\"""" because he probably has less tables now than he did before.  The only difference is that he didnt have a wine bar to send his customers to wait for 2 hours.\n\nIf you've been to Biancos then you already know the game but for those who dont, here goes:\n\n1. You won't get in unless you stand outside for about 90 minutes before they open.  (Please)\n\n2. If you get there when they open, you'll be waiting for 2 hours. (Please)\n\n3. To make your 2 hour wait better he has a wine bar, which miraculously accommodates all the people he cant seat, where you will probably spend over $100 in booze as you wait.  Sort of like the beverage equivalent of the slot machines in the Vegas airport.\n\n4. When you jump through all those hurdles, you'll get some awesome food.  You'll also notice that he only has a few tables which is why the wait is so long.  I can appreciate the fact that he wants to maintin the quality of his food, resulting in limited production but is it \""""all that\""""?  For outside visitors with time on their hands it's probably worth it to go once and check the box.  For locals like me, go somewhere else.  For smart locals, start another, larger pizza place across the street;"""""""
4	I love Valle Luna! I only give 4 stars because they don't blow me away good. We have so many mexican restarants in the valley to choose from  but what does impress me is that every time I have gone, the food is consistently good.Good chips and salsa which is very important. I love the margaritas there because they are never watered down tasting in fact, they tend to be a little heavy on the liquor which is a good thing but know that  before you plan to drive. I personally don't drink if I am so I always go there and make my husband drive ;-) It is a great place to meet people for food and drinks because they never rush you and it is very relaxed and friendly there. I for one will keep going

1	"""James Beard would have cut the corn.\n\n  --Okay so I know you must be wondering exactly what that means.  We went to the restaurant on a wed night--picked up a great rose from AZ Stronghold at public market to avoid the corkage fee and was looking forward to a new dining experience.  \n\nThings started out fabously--the wait person was well informed and helpful with the menu.  We decided to split three dishes.\n\nWe ordered the scallops appetizer--they were perfect!  done to perfection which is not easily done with scallops.  We split them --put one on each plate.\n\nNext came the jerk chicken salad--again--a wonderful complement of spicy chicken and mangos--the perfect marriage of spice and sweet.\n\nwe commented we had made the perfect choice of the Rose from AZ Stronghold and looking forward to the next course.\n\nand so it came--jerk prawns, grilled pineapple on slaw--with a half an ear of corn--ahhhhhh there's the rub.  the plate would looked lovely, but because we were sharing--I asked the wait person--if the corn could be cut in half--don't get me wrong, i really liked my dining companion, but could not just bring myself to  nibble on the same ear of corn.  the wait person took the plate  back to the kitchen--we were salivating because the prawns smelled really wonderful--\n\nthen the plate came back--and the ear of corn was still in tack--\nduring the course of rest of the evening we were given several reasons, why this simple request could not be accomodated\n\nahh-the chef is an artist and cutting the corn would have upset the balance of the design of the plate.  we could not cut the ear ourselves because there were no sharp knives.-- there are only two chefs and there isn\t time to accomodate special requests\n\nok--this is a restaurant with maybe 10 tables--by the time we left there were only 2 people left in the restaurant.--so special requests can't be accomodated?  Also we would have eaten the corn, but instead it was wasted.\n\nI am self employed and my customers are everything to my livlihood.  If I can accomodate I will even though it might not be exactly what I want to do--because the more important thing is I want to establish long term relationships with  them and have them come back again and again and again.\n\nUnfortunately--I will not be going back to breadfruit--the food was generally good--but I would rather spend my dining dollar in someplace the recognizes that it is so easy to accomodate simple requests and the benefit to do that is repeat customers.--it would have been so easy to have satisfied customers, by simply cutting the ear of corn."""""""
1	I love BBQ and cook my own at home on my Weber Bullet quite often.  I went to the location in Laveen on 35th ave.  I had very low expectations due to this being a redo of the terrible Shakey Jakes that was in this space previously.  Since I live in the area I first asked to get a to go menu so I can order from my house and do a pick up.  Unfortunately they did not have any menus printed up (this was a bad sign since the restaurant had just opened).  I decided on the ribs for myself and got the smoked turkey sandwich for my wife.  This place has an open kitchen which usually inspires confidence in me eating there.  Sadly what I saw made me want to cry.  The chef takes my ribs out of the fridge and cuts off some and proceeds to put them in the microwave!!!  At this point I should have just asked for my money back and left but I will always give a new place a chance.  \n\nWhen I got home with my food it was even worse than I thought.  My wife's turkey sandwich was smoked deli meat on a bun.  I am not kidding here.  You know how deli meat has that really salty processed taste, well this is exactly what this place was serving.  My ribs were no better.  Being a self proclaimed BBQ connoisseur I like to try my meat without sauce which will tell me if the cook really knows what they are doing.  I don't know if it was because my ribs were cooked in a mic or that they were already ruined but my ribs were dry and tasted like they were days old.  The sides we had were no better.  The potato salad was store bought from Costco or Safeway for sure.\n\nIn today's day and age I would have thought that privately owned restaurants would know that when customers come into their business they are looking for fresh made food.  Not pre-processed sides that I can get at Applebees or ribs that were made days earlier that are microwaved.\n\nLast word.  I was in the area yesterday and decided to drop by this place to see if they had to go menus........they still don't and I don't think I will ever be back.\n\nI love The Veen (Laveen) but we have absolutely no good restaurants out here.  Sadly Memphis adds to the list of substandard food choices in the southwest valley.
3	I don't share the enthusiasm for Camus as the past reviewers. While I agree with them on the food, it is top-notch, the service wasn't all that when I stopped in for dinner. \n\nWe sat at the bar and were half-heartedly greeted by the bartender with an attitude. My friend loves Chambord so we asked him what he could make to which he rolled his eyes and only offered a French Martini. This was surprising because I had heard from friends how the bartenders were creative and extremely knowledgable. \n\nAnd although it wasn't crowded, it took an extra long time for us to receive our food. He didn't even bring our salads out first! He waited to bring them ourwith the main meals. \n\nI plan to give this trendy place a second change because I did love our entrees and everyone just raves about Camus. Hopefully the waiter from hell has moved onto work at Denny's.
4	It would be 5 stars for the delicious, inexpensive food and the huge portions of their lunch specials (big enough for at least two people) for under $5. The food is always hot and tasty! I always recommend it to my friends and they all love it too. The building is kind of gross looking but the food is soooo good!\n\nThere are only 2 thing that are not as good as they should be.One is the wait even if you order over the phone and they say it will be 10-20 mins and you get there in 20-25 mins and they still make you wait another 15 mins like they are just getting to your order. The reason to call ahead is to have the order ready when you arrive. This happens every time we order. And quite often the orders are not correct. SO, you always have to check the details of your order before you leave.\n\nSecond, some of the women who work at the counter are incredibly rude like they dont care if anyone ever comes back to their restaurant. Their service is bad enough to the point that if their food wasn't incredible my family and friends wouldn't go there. The Asian women behind the counter are always friendly and smiling and I pray that they are working when we go there (and not the rude woman and her daughter who we think may be the owners.) I wish those two cared about customer service at all. You shouldn't go into a restaurant feeling like you should have to provide the staff with customer service so you get your order straight and so you dont get snide comments from the staff because of their mistakes. It's kind of ridiculous. Yes to me this is the fatal flaw with Chen & Wok. That is what took the 5th star! \n\nBUT! I will absolutely still keep going there because the food is soooooo good and I will still keep praying that the nice Asian ladies will be behind the counter so that I will get decent customer service.
2	Very disappointed . A nice environment wasted and not represented well. Our 15min wait turned into 30 and that was just the beginning to a not so great experience.\n\nI've had horrible service the last two visits I've made to this location. The service was extremely slow, and we were forgot about when sitting at the Sushi Bar. So my suggestion would be to sit at an actual table, so you're not disregarded. \n\nThe sushi was good but wouldn't say it was great for the money spent. A lil bland and the pieces were few. I've been to a good amount of sushi spots in the valley both 'commercial' and divey locations and this really missed the target all together on customer service and presentation. \n\nI will not be going back.
4	went with my cuz for thanksgiving dinner.  (not a traditional turkey lover)\n\nGood times.  Really liked the decor.  Very trendy and modern.  Loved the piano player. I wish there were more bars like this around here.  \n\nFood was GREAT.  service was real good too.  I had dumplings and pork lomein and my cuz at a spicy veggie tofu dish.  He could not stop raving about it.  All in all we feasted with a few other dishes and spent about $75 total.  Well worth it and we have decided we will go back sooner than later.
4	Had been wanting to try Marcellino's for awhile, but the last time we tried, it was closed as the owners were away in Italy.  Finally got around to a very overdue visit tonight.  Dinner was excellent. Started with a special app, buffalo mozzarella wrapped in proscuito served with roasted peppers, fresh basil and fresh tomatoes.  It was perfect.  The mozzarella tasted home-made.  Tried the mushroom linguine and red lingunie for entrees.  All of the pastas are made by hand in the restuarant.  Both dishes were very good.   Rounded out the perfect meal with a perfect slice of tiramisu.  They also gave a number of service items including, bruschetta with fresh tomatoes and basil before the app, and a shot of homemade limoncello with biscotti after desert.  With wine, it was about $65 pp which was reasonable.
5	"""Over the past couple years of my life, I have spent way, WAY too much time at fair trade. Reading books and drinking coffee is like my 3rd job, and I prefer to do it at my neighborhood cafe. \n\nIf I want drip coffee (which is almost always) I will go out of my way to come here. It's simply delicious. If I want something else I might go elsewhere, but nothing else in central/uptown/downtown Phoenix can compare to a Fair Trade Iced coffee. \n\nThe barista's are sweet, the live music on Saturday afternoons is a joy, the community computer has saved my ass at least a dozen times, it's \coffee with a conscience\"""", and it's a 2 minute walk from my apartment. Of course it gets 5 stars!"""""""
4	I enjoyed taking the karve class. The instructor was really friendly and helpful throughout the class, adjusting my positions. They use a ballet barre, which really adds something that other classes don't have. I was pretty sore from lifting weights two days before (I'm always more sore the second day), but thought it would be fine. For the most part, it was great. I would definitely try coming by when you aren't sore, or stretching for awhile before hand. We did have a lady leave after about ten minutes. I guess she couldn't hang. I don't think that should scare anyone off, though. You really can adjust this class to fit you. \nThe studio is light, clean and modern. They ask you to leave your purse outside on a peg. I was fine with it, but I would have preferred if they had lockers. One of the best things is the online sign up feature. You can manage all of your classes from their website. Really helpful!\nI'd like to keep coming, but I'm afraid $20 a class is too expensive a habit to start up regularly. Maybe every other week or so. It will also be a great place to go with girlfriends before lunch in Old Town. I'll be back for sure.
2	"""Friday ntght about 7\00.  We entered and said to  the person at the door (who we were informed was the owner) and said \""""Table for three.\""""  Without a word he looked us over and led us to a table / booth.   Our waiter came over, asked if we wanted anything to drink and we said we would probably have wine with dinner.   Okay.\nWine list was way overpriced, lowest entry around $46 but most were way above $60.  Selected a bottle which we were pleased with, after the waiter first came back and said they were out,   My wife and sister-in-law weren't too hungry and they asked to share a salad and order of spaghetti and meatballs.   I ordered the chicken/sausage cacciatore.   First came the wine (did I mention they had to go back to find the correct bottle).   Then the salad (pretty good actually).   Then a wait, and I mean a wait.   Probably  over 30 minutes minimum.    Wife and sister=in=law had a hefty portion of the spaghetti and meatball, but it was dry, devoid of any sauce \nnot a hint of red.  Looked like a meatball with spaghetti around it.   My meal was okay, nothing to write home about.  Meanwhile the owner was making his way around the place chatting up the customers (never said a single word to us the entire evening.   Oh yeah, the waiter gave us a coupon to use as my wife had left hers  in her car.  Best part of the evening.  Won't be back"""""""
4	Fun place for groups! Benihana wouldn't be my first choice for sushi or for going out at all really, but if you have a special occasion for some friends it would be a good place to consider. Pricey food, but I thought it was good. Haven't tried the sushi yet. \n\nBenihana is known for it's tables which are centered around a stove. You get your own chef who comes over and prepares your whole meal for you! They do lots of crazy tricks and entertain the table while cooking. Lots of fire tricks too! \n\nIt's the kind of place you can say you have been to and it;s a fun experience, but you don't need to go back after that.
4	A really nice Chinese restaurant in Arizona :) It was recommended by people in my Chinese church, and it makes me feel like home (Hong Kong) every time I go there (the food, the music, the people...)!! :D \n\nI personally think that the dim sum is better than C-fu and China King (but dinner in China King isn't bad :p, just that I think the dim sum's better here). Me, my family and my church friends frequent this restaurant ever since. :)\n\nHaven't tried eating dinner here though, but will try that probably tomorrow night with family! :p
3	"""First the good: Local Breeze Patio Caf\u00e9 has a wonderful patio, exceedingly friendly and prompt service, and some absolutely amazing house-made breads. Nom nom nom. \n\nBut it's that \patio caf\u00e9\"""" thing that gets me. If this were a diner full of chrome and half-aprons, I'd be all over giving them four stars. You expect a greasy spoon to be, well, greasy. Local Breeze, on the other hand, has a nice cozy/homey/island thing going on. So when my fried egg shows up in a pool of oil and my country potatoes are coated in enough oil to make two or three more servings, I can't help but look at my plate and think, \""""Damn, that's not what I was expecting.\"""" \n\nThe bacon and the toast were the heroes of my breakfast. The bacon was perfectly done and delicious. The toast, from their house-made buttermilk white, was unbeatable. I'm craving it again now just writing this review. The butter was nestled in with my potatoes to help soften it up. (Twenty points for Gryffindor!) The egg was edible and cooked to my order. The potatoes... the potatoes. Oh, the potatoes. They were wonderfully seasoned, but they were so damn greasy and inconsistently cooked I just gave up on them after a couple mouthfuls. \n\nNow, to be fair, they've got a variety of breakfast foods (like the amazing-looking challah french toast) that have no foreseeable possibility of exiting the kitchen drowning in refined rapeseed juice. I'd definitely go back and have one of those, and I'd certainly give Local Breeze a shot for lunch. But for a basic breakfast of eggs, toast, meat, and starch, they hit a little off-target for me.\n\nI should probably note here that the greasy egg would have been completely forgiven if it were fried in butter. Butter forgives a lot of sins. Oil's just unredeemable."""""""
5	My family and I very much enjoy the Phoenix Zoo. My children are all teenagers. We have maintained a membership for several years now and go 6 to 10 times a year. Zoolights is also one of our favorite holiday evenings. The young ones (and us oldies) also enjoy the splash pad to co off in the summer.\nMy husband and I plan ti rent one of the bikes soon with a picnic lunch at the lake there.\nWe also recommend ending your day at Papago Park watching the sun set from Hole-in-the Rock.
4	"""OsKar with a \K\"""" was our server and was super prompt with all of our orders and had a nice personality.  This place is casual and could use a lot more in the decoration department, but the food is what's more important and the food..... was GOOD!!! So fresh, healthy, just plain YUMM... My cousin eats here on the reg and had been trying to get me to try this place for the longest time.  I think I tried everything on the menu!! got some sesame bread and eggplant dipping sauce (it looked gross but tasted good so try it!!).  Tried the lentil soup, some cucumber-red onion-tomato salad (amazing), and a lamb dish with delicious white rice.  It's sad how i actually used to LIVE in Ankara, Turkey and my memory of the dishes left me!! Glad we finally went because places like this are far and few. It's right by a tattoo parlor and old bar but I don't see this all deterring diners.  Also- it has an \""""A\"""" grade posted in case you are curious.  Go here and enjoy!!"""""""
1	I've been here a couple of times, hoping that it'd get better, but it never does.\n\nThe food is greasy and very unappealing.  Well, if you like bland, flavorless grease, then it's ok.  There *is* a difference between a hard taco and a soft taco.  When they bring you the wrong kind and you politely point it out, then *do* offer to remake it for you, but they act like it's the biggest burden in the world.  \n\nWhile waiting for our order, I put my elbows on the table.  The table was so greasy, my arm slid across the table.  Ewww, gross.  Use more than an old dirty rag to wipe it down please.\n\nThere's one waitress that's very rude, and somehow I seem to get her.  I did notice that on my last visit, my debit card was charged and extra time for something I didn't order.  Classy.  I wonder how many times that goes and people just don't check their bank statements.  Luckily my bank is fixing that one.\n\nI'm still in search of a good Mexican eatery.
5	We stopped in here one night looking for dinner that strayed away from our usual fare of home cookin' or fast Mexican food and Maui Dog EXCEEDED our expectations!  \n\nThe seemingly unusual combinations of meat and fruit were matched perfectly and the flavors are unbelievable!  We got huge dogs, three sliders, a large tot and drink for less than $20.  \n\nWe had plenty of food and not only were our bellies happy, but our taste buds and brains were happy to have a chance to stretch their legs!  \n\nI can't WAIT to go back!
4	"""Alrighty, if you've been down to \The Bean\"""" anytime in the last year, you've more than likely seen my mug around there. It has slowly become my home away from home, so I feel fairly competent in giving a well rounded opinion. \n\nFirst off, as has been said by others, one of The Bean's best qualities is the fact that it is open 24 hours on the weekends (Friday 5 am - Sunday 11 pm). This works out wonderfully for us 21+ who don't want the night to end after the bar's throw us out to the streets. Basically, its a \""""you can't stay here, but you can go to The Bean\"""" kind of situation. For the rest of the week, it is open from 5 am till 11 pm, giving us night owls a place to hang around. \n\nNow I can get a bit into the drink and food. If you're coming to The Bean, you know the coffee is alright. It's certainly not the best cup you will get in AZ, but they do roast their own beans on premises a few times a week (ensuring a pretty fresh cup of joe). You can tell the roasting days by the smoke coming off the chimney, and the acrid, dizzying, and often intoxicating scent, suffocating the area. If the coffee is to your liking, you can purchase it to bring home, whole or pre-ground. Offering your standard array of drip, french press, espresso, latte's, cappuccinos, etc..., all available served hot or cold,  Xtreme Bean has your coffee fix, well, fixed.\n\nFor those of you not coffee inclined, the Bean offer's a large array of loose leaf teas, which you can mix and match to make your own creation (May I be allowed to recommend a Black Currant/Moroccan Mint blend, on ice?). Green teas, decaf, black, the have it all. Also offered: creme blended drinks, italian sodas in a plethora of flavors, Naked Juice.\n\nFood wise, they keep it pretty simple at the The Bean. Made fresh every 2 days, they have salads, sandwich's, and pita wraps, as well as a grand assortment of pastries (if you get there before noon, after which the pastries are usually gone) The wraps are alright, sandwich's are ok. It's all edible, and priced a bit higher then what its worth. Bagels, muffins, doughnuts, cookies, slices of cake, and usually some sort of banana bread all grace the food cooler. \n\nMoving on to seating, its pretty sacred reality if you get there during peak hours. With plenty of electrical sockets inside, in the floors and in the walls, The Bean is highly lap top friendly. The Internet connection is free, but it can border on agonizingly slow when there are numerous people using it. The aptly named Vault (The Bean IS located in what at one point was a bank) is generally known to be the quiet study section. Outside, there are your standard tables and chairs, most of which are falling apart, or wobbly, or bent. During the nights it can be difficult to impossible to find a spot, especially once it gets nice out. If you aren't a fan of smokers, then you may want to sit inside as nearly the entire patio is smoker friendly (even if the ashtrays mysteriously disappear every few months). \n\nEvery few nights, they have some sort of live music being played. Monday nights is given over to the piano and classic show tunes crowd, who, as you guessed, sing show tunes and take turns playing the piano. Loudly, might I add. Loudly, and incessantly, and they take over the majority of the seats inside. If you need to get work done on a Monday, move into the Vault (where its kind of quieter) or go outside. Friday nights are a rotation of performers, usually a single guitarist with an amp. These performers usually add more ambiance than annoyance to the atmosphere, so even if you are going to the shop to sit and talk with people, you can do just that without getting drowned out by the musicians. Be sure to request Freebird, one day someone will actually play it. \n\nI'm beginning to think I've rambled enough for now, but I'm fairly certain you've gotten a decent picture. Good for the people, the socialization, the place to go on weekends after, literally, everything else in Tempe has closed. If you're ever down to The Bean, feel free to say hello if you see me on the patio!"""""""
4	Yes, agreed, it is a chain restaurant.  However, it is convenient and the food is not bad.  I must say the servers must be challenged by the crowd that flocks in, especially during the weekend.  I have never seen a server just hanging around, they are always moving.  Ok, occasionally they may make a mistake, so what?  Who hasn't?  I love the patio, eating outdoors has a special feel to me.  I have been a goer of IHOP for many years.  I hope it i s around for a long time to come.
5	Ohhh Rokerij, how I love you so!\n\nTo begin, I do not think I have ever encountered an unfriendly or rude server here. The staff, both upstairs and downstairs, is incredibly friendly and helpful.\n\nThe wine list is amazzzzzing. So many yummy wines to choose from! Start with a glass of wine, then choose a couple of appetizers like the Brie Toasts or the stuffed mushrooms. Then, as a main course, go with the Garlic Plate or the Gumbo. Sooo good. Or the Porterhouse, or the Sea Bass, or the Pasta Heidi.. Can't go wrong with any of those. Even their House Salad is amazing. \n\nAfter dinner, enjoy some berries and gelato. Not too fattening but absolutely delicious!
2	"""All right.  It's come-to-Jesus time.  It's hard to watch a thriving business implode, but that's what is happening here.  I've been a regular at this Teakwoods for about 7 years now.  My husband and I liked the atmosphere, food and friendliness so much that it's safe to say we even considered this when we bought our house (within walking distance) back in 2007.  Everyone who worked there was welcoming and hard-working, from the bartenders to the servers to the bussers.  The wings (and other dishes) were great (especially as sports-bar food goes), beer selection was good, prices were reasonable.  We've seen staff (and management) come and go, but we've remained loyal, and actually have stayed good friends with many current and ex-employees, who have become like family to us.\n\nBut things have been steadily going downhill, and now I think they've nearly reached rock bottom.  \n\nIt started with cosmetic stuff.  Leaky ceilings, scruffy empty shelves behind the bar for a long time, mismatched and shabby (and some downright uncomfortable) furnishings, tatty bathrooms.\n\nThen, the food.  We used to look forward to the daily specials; now it seems management is finding ways to \repurpose\"""" leftovers or overstocks in new and unappealing ways and, frankly, in weird combinations.  Sliced hot dogs on a lavosh? Really?  Even one of my previously favorite appetizers, the caprese (oh--now spelled \""""caprice\"""" on the menu) tastes bland and worn out.  I used to LOVE the creamy, cheesy, meaty cheeseburger soup when it appeared on the menu, but I had it just a couple of days ago and was disappointed to find it watery, virtually tasteless, and sorely lacking in the meat department.\n\nPrices were raised (during the recent Arizona Beer Week; talk about opportunistic!), and a rash of regulars left in protest, and have stayed away.  But I and a dozen or so other regulars remained, largely because of the friendly and efficient service of a few remaining long-time servers there, along with a few awesome bartenders and wonderful bussers.  The service in general had also gone down over time, but management seems to want to drive it right into the dirt, as they decided this week to get rid of two of their best servers.  That was the last straw for pretty much all of the regulars who had remained.\n\nI feel like I'm going through a divorce.  It's sad and depressing to watch, slowly but surely, a decent business and a fun place run into the ground (going much the same direction, apparently, as the recently closed Maricopa and Phoenix locations of Teakwoods have gone) by bad management and poor decisions, who put \""""profits\"""" over people.\n\nWhy did I even give this place TWO stars? For the handful of wonderful staff who remain--AND for the wings, which are still great.  But if you MUST have them, I'd advise you to get them to go!"""""""
5	I love this store!!!! I wish they had 1 in California. This is the closest one to me!! So I only come out here once a year, when we go to AZ for spring training. This place has the cutest stuff. And a great selection on old school candy! I didn't go to the restaurant this time but I have been before. They had good food as well, such as chicken and dumplings, which I consider cozy and a great home cookin' meal!! I'll be back next year!!!
4	For some reason, drinking and loud music just seem to go together. \nYou know what else goes with drinking and loud music?\nYoung people.\n\nPersonally, I like young people. \nThey just seem so much happier than old people. \nYoung people are fun too, as they're often quick to experiment with alcoholic concoctions guaranteed to knock their dick in the dirt. (presuming of course there's a dick involved).\n\nThis is why I go to Sapporo.\nNo, not to get my dick knocked in the dirt...hell, I can do that at home.\nI go there because they have a discounted happy hour menu, costing about half of what others charge for this stuff, and, yes...to watch young people get their dick knocked in the dirt.\n\nI wish I could offer some guidance as it relates to menu items but I can't.\n\nIt seems that while the two or three take-charge type A's in our party are dutifully filling out the order form, I'm dutifully filling my gut with sake and beer. \nUnfortunately, I don't know what I just ate and for all I know, it could be filet of sharpei.\n\nIn short, if you're young and like to party, and, have a dick sorely in need of getting knocked int he dirt, you might want to try this place.\nIf you don't have a dick, bring your boyfriend or husband. \nAfter a few sake bombers....you'll have a dick on your hands for sure.
4	The food was really good.  I had the chicken lime salad, the kids had a cheese crisp and beans and my sister-in-law had a big burrito that she loved. \n\nThe atmosphere is really nice as the new location is a vast improvement over the last location. \n\nWe had a new server so you want to give them the benefit of the doubt but she was pretty bad.   Ordering a margarita from her was a bit of a nightmare - not going to lie.  I had to send it back and of course got the excuse that it was the bartender's fault. \n\nDon't order iced tea though if you are not a fan of sugar or sweet n low - that's all they have.
1	Food-wise, I think this place may have deserved 2 stars. I'm from the Bay Area, and the Thai food there is delicious!\n\nThe coconut soup wasn't what i expected-- the taste was okay, though a bit watery. I liked the lemongrass in it.  then we had Rama's Favorite, which was basically beef with peanut sauce. more like peanut butter-- the peanut was overpowering. \n\nthe WORST part was the food poisoning-- both my fiance and i subsequently got vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. i even had to bring him to the ER, it was so bad. I see Thai Basil is generally well reviewed here on Yelp, so maybe it was just an off day? but just warning you-- something we ate there was bad, and I think it was the Rama's Favorite.
5	I can't make any claims of wealth, but when it comes to grocery shopping, I like to support local as much and as often as I can.  So when I'm not at the farmer's markets trying to put what money I do have back into the local economy, I'm at Whole Foods buying the products grown and made locally.  I'm also a huge supporter of organic, so short of being a rebellious hippie living off my parent's trust fund money or a trophy wife with nothing better to do (that's the Whole Foods stereotype, isn't it?), I will admit that I love trips to Whole Foods in most capacities.\n\nThis isn't my go-to Whole Foods - as I live in Chandler (lucky for me, the Chandler Whole Foods is just as awesome), however much I wish it was, but I can feel safe knowing that when I find myself in N Scottsdale/Phoenix/Glendale, I have this big hulking beauty of a grocer to visit for anything I may need.
3	At one time this place was an outrageously good value. \n\nI used to work within a mile of Chen and Wok and it was a common lunch destination for a lot of people in my company. The quality was noticeably better than other strip-mall Chinese places. You could get the quality of a sit-down place from take out. That was the magic of Chen and Wok.\n\nIn the last few years it's become more or less equal to its competitors. You still get a lot of edible stuff for a little money, but it's just . . . edible stuff. . . . \n\nThe only remaining advantage is delivery if you happen to be in the Cent Pho area, though their minimum order for delivery is now $15, and I think a charge applies.
3	The food is always good, I am only doing 3 stars because of the service. After about 6 different visits, I can honestly say the service is terrible. Most recently we did take out, and well that took 30 waiting in the lobby after the time they said the food would be ready to actually get the food. When we have sat down, the service is pretty slow and seems to take quite a while to get our food! The food is great and the portions are a good size, but wow, bring your patience!! I hope they read the reviews about their service and step it up!
1	Maybe the ONLY good thing I like about this place is that the person at the door  stamps your whole family's arm with a number that can be viewed under a black light---that way Peds or Weirdos don't try to leave with a random kid if the number doesn't match under the glowing black light.\n\nDon't try to walk in with a juice box in the open--they won't allow it. They want you to buy their sugary sodas for the kiddies.  If you do sneak in a Juice Box, Capri Sun, or bottle of water, be sure to conceal it in your purse, pocket, or diaper bag. They treat the situation like you are sneaking in a case of beer or something!\n\nThe pizza is really disgusting! The crust is so nasty, not sure WHO thought this even tastes good enough to eat. Cheese Whiz on a saltine is gourmet compared to this CRAP!\n\nMany of the games were OUT OF ORDER....and there were way too many teenage girls crawling through the kiddie play tunnel for actual little kids to get in it.  \n\nHey Chuck E Cheese, how about some carpet deodorizer??? There is nothing like the smell of stale vomit lingering in the dining area when trying to consume overpriced nasty pizza, how appetizing! Yum!
4	"""Tasty new addition to the Old Town Scottsdale area. Went on their opening day for lunch, then back again for dinner. They're still working out new-place kinks, but nothing serious.\n\nFor lunch I had the spicy brat and sweet peppers. For dinner the chorizo sausage and chutney. You can't go wrong on either the basic or premier sausages, but if you're unsure what to try go for a sweet/spicy combo. Like the spicy brat and a sweet topping, or sweet brat and spicy toping. If you like sauerkraut, it's all homemade (like the sausages) so give it a try. If you don't like sauerkraut, you're a strange person and should probably not go to a bratwurst house. And I feel bad for you. I'm sorry.\n\nWhere was I... oh yes, their belgian fries are great, and I am a fan of the sriracha aoli dipping sauce. Of course, they pretty much had me at \sriracha\"""". \n\nTheir beer list is very well rounded. I'm not a huge fan of belgians and german beer, so was a little worried, but there is plenty of great beer there to drink across the whole spectrum. Chatted up Ben The Beer Baron for a while, and he definitely knows his stuff. Don't be shy about asking him for recommendations."""""""
5	"""This place has the authentic feel of a country mercantile or a general store.  Always a friendly welcoming vibe and clearly a neighborhood anchor and community gathering place.  They celebrate the traditions of making and growing things with your hands, of recycling and repurposing... Living a sustainable lifestyle in all the right ways.  The co/op is filled with one of a kind items of good quality and reasonable prices, thoughtfully presented.  Quality wins out over quantity here, with vintage and modern items displayed side by side.  They showcase the work of some wonderful jewelry artists and have both mens' and womens vintage clothing.  You can find affordable craft tools, buttons and supplies, vintage linens and unusual antique curiosities.  There are opportunities to see artists at work and of course to participate in the ongoing care of the farm outside that extends right out to the curb.\n\nEvery piece of clothing or jewelry I have bought here has generated many comments of \where did you get that?\"""" from complete strangers.  I am happy to direct customers over to the GROWop as I know they will enjoy it and return again and again!  This is a fine place to shop local for yourself or for unusual gifts and it is great to know that your purchases help support the farm and cooperative."""""""
5	I am a ruined woman.\n\nWe went to Mastro's last weekend for my husband's Christmas party and I have not been able to stop thinking about that luscious, juicy, cooked to perfection New York strip ever since that night. I have dreamed about it night and day with mixed feelings... happy to have had the experience, yet woefully sad that it is over.  That was undeniably the best steak I have ever had and I fear no food will ever again hold joy for me and pale in comparison next to that absolute masterpiece of red meat!\n\nEverything about that night was perfect. All the food was top-notch, from the steak to the sides (garlic mashed potatoes, creamed corn- which was incredible- and steamed asparagus) to the cheesecake to the heavy handed cocktails.  The service was outstanding! The staff was truly professional and knew their craft, without coming off as stuffy or snobby like so many other Scottsdale eating establishments do.\n\nMy only complaint is that the placement of the private rooms being right off the kitchen means that the room gets stuffy as the kitchen really heats up. It also means you better mind your P's and Q's when walking to and from the bathrooms cuz you will be maneuvering past determined and busy wait staff.\n\nI have no idea what everything cost since like I said it was a company Christmas party, but regardless, I would love to rent a private room for my b-day when I hit the big 4-0.
4	I've eaten at Hanny's now a few times and I've never been disappointed at all. The restaurant is perfect for lunch if you want to actually sit and have a conversation without having to yell over the crowds or loud music. The decor is very contemporary and clean which is nice and refreshing.\n\nI've had their flatbread pizzas and everyone is fantastic! The regular BLT was also very good and don't forget to treat yourself to the homemade donuts! They are delicious! Give Hanny's a try next time you are downtown for lunch. The prices will certainly surprise you as well as they are cheaper than most places downtown as well!!!\n\nI can't wait to go back again!
4	Need a place to get your heart rate up, blood flowing or work off your dog's excess energy?  This is a great option.  I'm here just about daily and usually TWICE per day with my puppies for a two mile or so walk around the perimeter and interior paths of this well manicured, well lighted (at night) park.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a much better option than a dog park even though it isn't an off leash area.  Also, if you drop by late at night with a blanket, this is a GREAT place to lay on your back and gaze at the stars without light pollution to interfere.
3	I have to qualify this review up front.  This is a review from a non-drinker and non-bar-hopper.  I just happened to be there because the team wanted to explore the area near the JW Marriott Desert Ridge.  So, as far as I could tell, it was clean, open, with a variety of seating, a decent-sized dance floor and terrible music.  It was very popular perhaps because there wasn't much in the way of competition around.  It was, as far as nightclubs go, very loud.  I would give the Blue Martini a higher rating if it weren't for the terrible music; 3 stars seems about right because everyone appeared to be pretty happy to be there otherwise.
4	What a great spot! We did #evfn here last Friday on the suggestion of one of our attendees. Mike and his crew treated us right the whole way!\n\nFood: well... I didn't eat that night. Not that it didn't look fantastic. The Sloppy Fries look like something I could sleep in. The burgers were massive. And every table that had wings didn't talk until they were devoured. I'd say that was a positive.\n\nBeer: GODS! Any place that keeps Arrogant Bastard on tap is going to get bonus points from me. But they've got a great tap selection of local craft brews and national favorites. Discriminating beer drinkers -- that would be me -- will not be disappointed. \n\nI'll be back!
5	I know that there's a movement for people to be more green and therefore live simpler and consume less, but dammit, Fashion Square makes it really tough. From the moment you walk through the glass doors all you'll want to do is consume, consume, consume!!! \n\nI LOVE THIS MALL because it's literally got everything you could ever want under one roof to please your ego and buy some self-esteem!\n\nNeed to treat yourself because you've got three kids? Grab yourself three pairs of shoes at Nordstrom's. (Yup, I did that and I do deserve them!)\n\nBad boyfriend who needs to make it better? Make him pay big time at Louis Vuitton!\n\nKids in high school treat you mean, and now you're a tech millionaire? Vrrrooooom vrrroooom into the Tesla store.\n\nFood, shopping, and levels of stores so expansive you will get lost and not know where you got dropped off by your taxi! (Yup, that happened to us as well)\n\nEnjoy your time shopping here and a word to the wise: WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES!!!\n\n31 Yelps Challenge: #22/31
4	"""Great addition to the area! North Scottsdale needs more quick and easy lunch places like Which Wich. \n\nWe had lunch there a few days after it opened. The place was packed, but the manager helped move the line along by explaining how the ordering system worked. First, you select a brown paper bag based on what type of meat you want, then fill in the ingredients. Next, pay and hand the bag to the cashier. Finally, collect your sandwich at the end of the counter.\n\nI ordered a turkey sandwich and had some of their homemade chips. Great sauce selection that includes A1, hummus, honey mustard and spicy ranch! There are three sizes: 7\, 10\"""", and 14\"""". The regular 7\"""" runs around $6, which includes cheese and all veggies (avocado costs extra). Not the best sandwich out there, but superior to the average sandwich chain. Will definitely make this a regular lunch spot!"""""""
3	Arrived at 4:30 for my own not-so smart incident. I think i need stitches!  \n\nFour other patients in front of me. The nurse on duty said they would be right with me.\n\nGot called by the RN at 4:59, back in the waiting room at 5:08. Got my bracelet and clean gauze. At least there's a plug-in or two in the waiting room to the left of the front door to charge my iPhone.\n\nFront desk nurse offered something to drink for another patient, then offered drinks to us all in the waiting room. Not a bad policy!\n\n5:52 made it to an examination room. Waiting for the doctor.\n\n6:22 Dr Tejada came took a look and agreed, stitches. \n\n6:26 moved to a procedure room and received two stitches and bandaged up.  \n\nOut the door at 7:04. Not too bad a wait, friendly and professional staff.
4	In my 37 years I have never been to a Waffle house, I know crazy right?? Went their sat night and being a true geek sat at the counter to watch the cooking go down.  I of course ordered a waffle with chocolate chips & whipped cream,,yea that's how I like it! Got me some loaded hash browns with ham & onions and coffee, man so good luv it!!! Service was fast and friendly; it was great late night snack on a Sat Night! Ill will be back!
5	This place is unbelievable!  The man and I were out and about and stopped off at Lux for some coffee.  While we were outside enjoying the GORGEOUS weather we finally have, he noticed the sign that they had margherita pizza, so we decided to give it a try.  And we're so glad we did!!  This place is i.n.c.r.e.d.i.b.l.e. for the following reasons:  \n1:  She spoke to the chef in italian when she told him our order.\n2:  Our order came quickly and she offered to bring it outside instead of us having to wait for it.\n3:  We got a Coke and a Sprite, which was actually Mexican Coke and Sprite in the bottles made with actual sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and they were cold and delicious!\n4:  Everything she brought us from the plates to the silverware is environmentally friendly.\n5: She brought two little pieces of homemade chocolate with toffee in it.\n6: Now what you've been waiting for...  The pizza.  We were a little hesitant about the crust just by looking at it, but one bite in, we were in love.  The crust was flavorful and light and crispy but not too crispy with a hint of sweetness and that glorious wood-stone oven flavor.  You could tell that the marinara sauce was homemade and it tasted like they'd picked the tomatoes fresh from their garden that morning.  The mozzarella  had just enough pull to melt in your mouth instead of getting caught in your throat and the basil was fresh and glorious.  It was seriously the best pizza I've ever had.  \n\nIf you're in the mood for something authentic, fresh and AMAZING, go to Pane Bianco.  Support this locally owned business.  You won't be disappointed.
4	Thanks Yelpers for recommending this place. Spent four nights here. What value! You get a cooked to order breakfast every morning and a cocktail hour everynight. The bartender will make just about anything for you. Great way to meet other travelers.\nStaff is very friendly. Grounds are well maintained. Rooms are dated but adequate. Very few channels and movies. Shower stall is very small. Mattress was very comfortable. Nice jacuzzi to deal with aches and pains from a day of hiking.Several pools.\nWill return
3	The plates are all very tasty but my god, the servings are SO SMALL! \n\nThe first time I ordered two soft tacos with rice and beans. It was about $9. I finished my meal in about 3 minutes and was still hungry so I ordered two more tacos, finished them in about 2 minutes, and was still just barely full. So I concluded that I spent about $13 to eat Mexican food at a walk-up restaurant. The sides of rice and beans were about 4 spoonfulls total.\n\nThe second time I ordered a more substantial plate but still did not leave feeling full, or feeling like I got my money's worth. The food is good- definitely 4 stars but the price compared to the portion size and tastiness is definitely 2 stars.\n\nI've never seen a walk-up Mexican restaurant cost so much money. I'd expect to pay that at a sit-down place and have leftovers.
3	I was seeing all the great things about this burger spot and had to try it... I arrived to a very packed and busy restaurant the line moved fast. Came up to the counter to order and I went with the Double Charburger with Sweet Potato Fries and an order of French Fries. It was really impressive how fast the food did come out. This Place seems to be a place for families and kids they were running all over. I rate the food as followed.\n\nThe Habit Double Charburger B+\nSweet Potato Fries B\nFrench Fries D+ \n\nIt was a nice change in burger spots but will not make me change my #1 burger choice.
5	After watching Man vs Food, there was no way we were about to let another weekend go by without checking out this place! About a 5 minute drive from our place, we arrived around 7pm on a Friday night... it took us 10 minutes to find parking! That was our first indication it was going to be good! We were promptly seated in a cozy, nothing fancy table. Families to our left, couples to our right, Marc Anthony special blaring from the TVs, get the picture?\nThis is one of the only places in Phoenix I've been to that doesn't serve alcohol, it didn't take away from the experience at all, but a good thing to know before going. \nOur tortas were awesome awesome awesome! So reasonable, tasty, authentic. \nWill be back again soon =)
5	To this day, all I can think about is their Shrimp Enchiladas. If you are going to order one thing from this restaurant, make it that. They come in a Fiestaware bowl...caked with a melt-in-your-mouth green Tomatillo sauce, topped with Sauza cheese. To make it even better, the inside has fresh shrimp, cooked just-right tortilla and topped with a fresh, crisp cabbage slaw (not mayo rich, just enough -- thinking they use sour cream instead?) So, I had this my first night and I could have eaten it for the next three nights while I was there. Heavenly.\n\nThe outdoor patio is wonderful, relaxing and even though it was chilly, there were plenty of heat lamps and I was a bit jealous of the folks that nabbed the fire pit. Live music pretty much every night (I'm not the one to judge this considering I don't venture much into guitar cover band land.) Service was a bit flake the first night, but the the second time we dined there the waitress was top notch. \n\nI heard that local folks often eat there even if they aren't staying at the hotel and I could see why. It's a beautiful setting, relaxing and wonderful local flavors.\n\nP.S. Breakfast is good too! Opt for the al-a-cart breakfast if you're not a big eater in the mornings, the buffet seemed a tad much and overpriced for the amount of food you could actually eat from it. But, that's the American way!
4	Fun Saturday night music venue with good food & beer for only a few $. The music is fun and tunes everyone knows. The 1$ carne asada tacos are straightforward; meat, cilantro, onion, grilled jalepe\u00f1o - delicious! Saw some lucious burgers being served. Will have to try one next time.  Will definitely be back!\n\nAs with any outside venue, as a non-smoking asthmatic I appreciate adherence to the 50ft from door rule. I'm sure other non-poluters would appreciate as well. As seems to be the norm, smokers only care about smoking. I can appreciate that its an addiction, but think of others occasionally please.
3	im not a hater in any way, shape, or form...\n\nim just sayin, i kinda grew up with chicken and waffles since i was a kid...plenty of spots in Oakland for some quality chicken and waffles...\n\nive had much better elsewhere...\n\nkinda reminded me of the hype of when i went to go have chicken and waffles at Roscoe's in L.A....after having it, i wasnt impressed either.\n\nthe chicken itself was cooked perfectly...the batter wasnt all that great...\n\ncrispy? yes.\n\nneeded more salt and other flavors...i mean, when you get chicken and waffles, its a play on sweet and savory, right?  flavors gotta be poppin off in your mouth, but the flavors just wasnt there for me...might have been an off day or something...\n\nvery friendly staff tho...
3	I went to Cyclo due to a review I found in a guide book.  It seems whenever I'm on the road, I'm in search for pho.  The decor on the inside is cute and modern,  not what you'd expect looking from the outside.  Reading from previous reviews, I guess I met Justina.  I love her originality and eccentric-ness.  But I didn't love the menu prices.  Sorry, but here in OC I can't imagine paying $9 for pho!  It was good, but the soup wasn't hot enough for me.  The beef was pretty darn tasty though.  And the Vietnamese coffee was just right.  It was nice that they served it in. . .actually, I don't know what it's called.  The coffee drips into a cup of condensed milk.  Then you mix it and pour it into a glass of ice.  Now I wish I had ordered a dessert.
3	Good theater with on par service.  Friendly smiles all around, and young people who actually do their jobs!  They work hard to keep the theater's clean, and patrons actually help out (most take their trash otu with them -- who'da thunk that one?)  Overall, a family friendly movie theater with easy access for disabled patrons.  Pricey, but heck -- isn't that the case with all theaters these day (Anyone remember when you could get into the movies for under a buck?  Agh!  I am dating myself...I digress.)  Tip - save some $$ and buy your tickets through AAA.  Discount tickets are good for most shows, except for special engagement viewings.
5	"""i've been meaning to write this review since i first stepped foot into Ish Salon back in january of this year..... a part of me selfishly feared once i wrote it, my rad hair guy would suddenly be so booked-up, i wouldn't be able to get an appointment. \n\nhowever, i can no longer keep my hair happiness to myself. ryan deserves the accolades : )\n\nhair is the very first thing i notice about people.\n\nand there is nothing more glorious than a healthy, shiny, well-maintained head of hair. most girls i know are borderline obsessed with theirs, and i'm no exception. \n\nhowever, i totally screwed up...... \n\nwhen i left my incredible hair salon back in san francisco, and moved to arizona, i had no idea where to go to get my hair done. i was nervous, scared, unsure. i asked every girl around and pretty much all of them suggested some fancy frou frou salon in scottsdale filled with overly tanned girls named britney who think the striped highlights and anchorlady helmet poof thing is attractive. ugh.\n\nso one day, when i was finally sick of destroying my hair with the boxed color from walgreens, i just bit the bullet and did a search for salons in the ahwatukee foothillss, where i live. lo and behold i find Ish. not a lot of reviews, but the ones they had seemed good. i went for it.\n\nthe first time i met ryan i was immediately taken in by his warmth and charm. he also made me laugh.... \OMG what have you DONE to your hair?!?! STOP USING BOXED COLOR!\"""" hahaha i swear he was *thisclose* to kicking me out of the salon for horrible, damaged box-color hair. \n\nas he did his magic on my crying locks, i took in the salon's over all vibe. liked it. turns out ryans dad owns the salon, everyone is nice. \n\nthe true test of ryan's genius was when he pulled out a big hand-held mirror and led me outside into the natural light so i could see the beautiful blonde miracle he had performed. i gasped. a lady walking by had to shield her eyes from the bright platinum hair glowing in the glare of direct sunlight.... it was like looking at a thousand suns. hahaha\n\nok, i'm kidding.... but not about how gorgeous my hair turned out. \n\nlet's just say, ryan has won a loyal fan for life..... and if all of a sudden he starts booking up solid for months on end, i'll regret writing this review. \n\nbut as i replied back to his text last night confirming i would see him today at noon, i was giddy thinking how terrific i knew i would feel walking out of the salon today. sometimes that's all a girl needs in this world.\n\noh...... and a funny side note. i stopped watching MTV's the real world sometime back in my 20's, but it turns out ryan was on this show a few seasons ago.(the new orleans one i think?) which of course i could totally see with his tall, fun, rock star self : ) thanks for making me feel pretty!"""""""
5	I ate here in January while at a work-conference in downtown Phoenix.  The meal and overall experience was perfect.  CIBO feels like a home, and I think it actually is a converted home.   \n\nThe staff is extremely nice, with a bit of hippie-quirky, which we enjoyed.  You could tell that they were passionate about food, fresh ingredients, and health.  The food was great (i had salad and a pizza), and the portion sizes were very large.  I would estimate 2 pizzas and 1 salad for 3 people next time.  I will definitely be back there whenever I'm in Phoenix.
5	"""Last night was AWESOME! We celebrated Binnie's birthday at Rice Paper on 7th Street and had great food, great beer and - of course, great company.\n\nStarted with Fire Cracker Shrimp, Crispy Calamari and Wings as appetizers (the wings were DEFINITELY my favorite, though all were great) then moved on to the spring rolls filled with Tuna, Soft-Shelled Crab and Shrimp. GOD, YUMMMM! From there, we did the Pho (which gets REALLY spicy with a big dollop of \the red stuff\"""") and finished everything with cupcakes that they let us bring in from Urban Cookies.\n\nIf you haven't been there yet, GO! It's small, but WAY cool and Derrick, our waiter was THE BEST! Since none of us were really used to ordering Vietnamese food, he was really helpful and SO friendly. This spot for me is a definite repeat, despite some of the comments about service and prices on Yelp. 7 of us ate till we were STUFFED and 6 of us had beers. Total bill was $122 (plus tip). So, I don't think that was bad at all..\n\nSO MUCH FUN, and Happy Birthday Binnie!!!!"""""""
2	I am a member of another gym which I frequent for most of my work-outs but I needed a pool, too so I got a membership here, as well. The pool is good, it's kept at a cooler temperature, which is nice (gets your more ready for open water swims in events) and it's not crowded. Overall, the gym layout is odd and wending your way through the mess of cardio machines to get to the locker rooms is a little bit tough. The locker rooms are eh. They aren't very nice and are very basic, but that's fine since I don't spend much time in there anyway. Their class schedule, which I have reviewed but don't intend to use is very sparse! My other gym has over a dozen classes a day but this place has a dozen in a week. However, for convenience of a morning swim on my way to work, it is fine. Though it's not top notch by any stretch and I have had to avoid a cleaning crew vacuuming around my treadmill which was a little annoying for what it is, it's fine. And the prices are decent.
3	Great breakfasts if you stick to their strengths--bagels, challah, potato pancakes, lox, etc. The breakfast sliders are fantastic, and my wife is a huge fan of the breakfast tapas.\n\nSkip the skillets, scrambles (with the possible exception of the Leo), omelets, and regular diner fare; this really isn't where Chompie's talents lie and they've been a disappointment every time I've strayed.\n\nOh, and watch your step getting out of your booth. Why they thought it was wise to make you step up 6 inches to sit in them is beyond me.
5	"""Coming through PHX on my way home to So. Cal. ,it was time for Dinner.\nI didn't want a sit down, give a tip,or have good table manners,  we just wanted a drive thru.  My wife spotted a bill board with \ Steaken Burger\"""" on it and we just had to stop. \nHey, this place was very good, in fact we split the wings, and a burger with fries. The meat  was cooked perfect and  the wing's were spot on. \nHere in So. Cal we just got a 5 Guys around the corner , but your SteakenBurger kills .LUCKY YOU !!!\n\nT"""""""
4	Pricey, but worth every penny. \n\nI like going here when I'm not busy. I get fois gras almost all the time, and the oysters are good too... I forget what else I order, but it's always good! I have yet to try out their entire menu but I'm stuck ordering the same thing coz it tastes so good. \n\nEvery time I've been here the service has been pretty awesome... Except this one time my waitress didn't refill my water for the longest time. I thought I was going to die from dehydration. :( But other than the ONE TIME they've been darlings. \n\nThe one thing that I HATE *GASP!* is the enormous plates they use for the entrees I order. I mean. I got the kumamoto oysters and they're wee cute little oysters. Four of them, barely the size of my thumb all nestled on this plate of ice the size of TITANIC. Okay, not that big, but it took up 1/3 of my table! I was like. Are you serious? I don't even have room to eat. :(\n\nI still love this place though, complaints are minor, just a pain when I bring my boyfriend who doesn't eat anything I like to eat. It makes me feel ronery at the table.\n\nI hope they expand their restaurant size in the future, possibly install table grills to make Okonomiyaki?\n\n*Hopes&prays&wishes*
5	If you like spring rolls, you have to go to Rice Paper. For those of you who don't know, spring rolls are the non deep-fried type, rather, they have fresh lettuce, mint, cilantro and such inside a rice paper shell. Think of it as a Vietnamese Burrito. At Rice Paper they have it set up almost like a sushi bar. You have your choice of about 20 different spring rolls (all priced under $4). You check what you want and they make it in front of you. The spring rolls come in all types from sushi grade tuna, to fried crab, to shrimp and vietnamese sausage. Each comes with a special dipping sauce catered to the roll. If you don't like spring rolls, I recommend the Bahn Mi, which is a Vietnamese sandwich that you'll never forget served with sweet potato fries. Or try the Pho noodle soup, or even (I can't believe I'm saying this since I hate salads) the salads are great. They make cocktails infused with lychee fruit like the Lycheejito (a twist on the mojito). You can't go wrong here, and the great thing is is that everything is so refreshing and healthy, you feel great afterwords, especially on a hot Phoenix summer day.
4	My review is only for the bar and drinks! \n\nMy girlfriend and I came here upon hearing that they serve Irish Coffee. We recently visited San Francisco and had Irish Coffee at the Buena Vista Social Club and wanted to relive that amazing night. \n\nThe Irish Coffee here of course wasn't as good as SF but it was very good! The bartender was very friendly. The drinks were pretty steep at $10 each but they are meant to enjoy at a leisurely pace.
4	I tried to hit this place with Julie P. on opening day, but traffic was backed up from the entrance all the way to 29th Ave, along Indian School Rd. We retreated to another supermercado, our dreams of tacking a whack at the opening day pi\u00f1ata completely dashed.\n\nFortunately, Helen Y. and i were combing the area before going to Tim Finnegans, so we checked it out. The layout is almost identical to the Ranch Market on 16th st. and Roosevelt, with the same amazing produce and aguas frescas. The seafood bar isn't as snazzy, and I'm not sure they have grab 'n'  go containers of salsa -- you can buy it by the pound at the salsa bar, which would take an extra 30 seconds or so. \n\nWhat's cool about this location (besides being a ten minute drive from the Melrose District), is that the Costco Business Center shares the parking lot, and they sell dirt-cheap restaurant supplies. A trip to both places could outfit a barren fridge and kitchen for about 18 bucks. Since I plan to cook five nights a week until things turn around, 33rd Ave. and Indian School is recession-busting headquarters.
2	If you decide to eat here, definitely come during happy hour for their great deals.  We ordered items from both the regular and happy hour menu. We started with the usual edamame which were a little overdone, but tasty.   The highlight of the night was the saut\u00e9 roll and lobster salad roll.  The spicy tuna roll and Philly roll were mediocre at best.  On to the main courses:\n1) Salt and pepper cod tempura style - Tempura batter is supposed to be light and crispy, but this dish was nothing like that. You would think that since the dish has the word salt in it's name, it would not lack on the seasoning- also not the case. Because it was so bland, I had to ask the waitress to bring a side of tempura sauce for me to dip the fish in to make it edible.\n2) miso sea bass:  to do miso marinated fish properly, you have to marinate it for at least a couple of days. This tasted like the fish was just broiled and brushed with some sauce that tasted off somehow (not enough miso maybe?)  \n3) kung pao chicken: this was spicy with bold flavors, but had a very americanized taste to it.  I think it would've tasted better if they didn't call it kung pao.  \n4) fried rice: this was pretty good. The rice was al dente, and seasoned well, but also had an Americanized taste to it.\n5) rice pudding: this was tasty, but a little on the dry side. I think it had coconut milk in it which gave the good flavor.  My advice is to save your appetite and money for another establishment.
4	The place was very busy for a Thursday, but we had a table within a few minutes.  Our server was very prompt and attentive, and the drinks and food were well paced.  Their margaritas are very good for a chain. The food was also quite  good, with the steaks done medium rare properly and the sides were tasty.  My pulled pork was a huge serving and was moist but not too greasy.  The rolls were good but did not seem fabulous as others claim (warm and fresh, but a bit too greasy on the outside).  Overall a great non fuss dinner out for a reasonable cost.
3	"""I went to Ko'Sin for restaurant week. The resort is located in a remote area off of 202 & 10 - the location/setting is solid, that's for sure. Knowing this, I requested  a table with a view as I made the reservation. The restaurant was more or less empty when we were sat. A few minutes later, an older couple exuding wealth and affluence walked in and were sat right next to us, directly in front of the window. \Best seat in the house - enjoy,\"""" remarked the hostess. Gee, thanks.\n \nThe selections were decent, but nothing amazing - we had the salmon and gnocchi, and they were both mediocre. Nothing special, quite bland to be more specific. Same with the appetizers. What was amazing, however, was the \""""Elvis\"""" - this was a treat: Peanut Butter Blondie/ Roasted Banana Ice Cream/ Milk Chocolate with Crispy Bacon Shards. I figured I might as well honor the namesake and lick the plate clean, which I did, minus the yellow paint that seemed to have been sprayed on with some fancy confectioners air brush (no idea if such thing exists - making it up). I really hope this becomes a permanent fixture on the menu, because I'd totally go back just to have it again.\n \nDuring the course of the meal - one of the servers spilled a drink on me. I was wearing a white shirt. He apologized profusely, and grabbed me a towel to dry myself off. I wasn't expecting a handout or some kind of a comp. considering the menu is already set quite reasonably, but I was surprised that I wasn't even offered one. When I dine at finer establishments, I'm normally offered free dry cleaning or an appetizer/drink of choice. Not the case. I don't think the server even elevated the issue to anyone - am I weird for having expected a customary table touch?\n\nMay return to check out the resort for a weekend, but I will not be returning to the restaurant."""""""
3	So I pull up in my Ford Taurus, get valet parking, and watch them park it in-between a next years model Ferrari and a Bentley. Entertaining to me. :)  We walk through a very charming little place to T. Cook's and enjoyed a nice meal.  Service and the atmosphere were great.  The food however was just ok.  For the price, the food was not at all worth it. However, being what T. Cook's is, I would have to say that it's a great place for a special occasion or a date for the average Joe. Very impressive dinning experience, I just wish the food would have been better.  Atmosphere - A+ Food - C-
4	Mickey's Hot Dogs is a slightly gritty Taqueria during the week. Ironically, The guy with the mesquite and the grill doesn't show up until Friday! Sonoron Dogs rock! I have to be the first to confess that mayo in a squeeze bottle DOES wierd me out a little, but the bacon and cheese thing is pretty yummy! If you come during the week for the taqueria, be prepared for everything from lengua to barbacoa etc. Really down home, good salsa but not fresh hand made tortillas.\nThere is really no atmosphere. It is a little gritty. The food is worthwhile.
4	We've been coming here for years and the food is consistently yummy.  The service can be a bit hit or miss sometimes, but their complimentary banana bread and rolls surely make up for it!  Fresh baked and super tasty these pre-dinner freebies are one of my favs!\n\nI usually always get a seafood noodle dish (Nagasaki Sara Udon or Yaki Udon) and am always delighted at the flavors and large portions.  \n\nCherry Blossom is a quaint place, where you can watch the chef's at work and always good for a tasty meal.
5	This is definitely the best place yet for home fitness equipment. Fitness 4 Home Superstores has stores in Tempe and Scottsdale. Bob Lachniet, the owner of Fitness 4 Home Superstores - has done something I have yet to see in other stores. Most other places I've visited, are focused on making the sale - and pushing product through their doors. WIth Bob and his staff,  they make sure you get exactly what you need - and they keep it within your budget!  The service I've received from his staff should act as the benchmark for what any store should provide a customer.
3	7/15/12\n\nWow, this location is SMALL!  My first taste of Four Peaks was at the cavernous Tempe location, which I found to be too large, too loud, and too busy for my taste (plus there's not enough parking spaces!).  This one in Scottsdale is more to my liking.  Intimate and not too dark inside (outside, however, I couldn't tell if there was patio seating since it was so dark), open sight lines from most points in the restaurant, the women's restroom looked and smelled clean, AND parking isn't a problem.\n\nCame in to order a pint of peach ale, knowing that I can't buy it at stores.*  I inquired about the possibility of taking some home and was told that I may purchase a growler.**  A pint costs around $4, but during happy hours cost $3.25 (pitchers $14/$12).  Reverse happy hour starts at 10p.  Please note that their register's clock runs slow, so you may have to wait a few minutes longer before you can start getting happy.***\n\nFYI, if you've misplaced your driver license, you may use a passport to get past the I.D. checker at the door.\n\n*Whole Foods sells growlers now, and most keep peach ale on stock.\n\n**Growlers are pressurized receptacles that hold 64 oz. of whatever beverage you want to take with you.  A new growler costs $14 and can be refilled for $10.  It is recommended that people finish the 64 oz. within 24 hours of opening, but I was told that the beverage will stay fresh for longer than that.  BTW, peach ale is offered for takeout AND isn't a seasonal variety like I thought it was.  FYI, I didn't enjoy the ale here as much, since it wasn't ice-cold, like the one I had at Tempe's Lucky Break.  I'll have to remember to ask for a frosted glass, if it's available.\n\n**Drink because you are happy, but never because you are miserable.- G.K. Chesterton, Heretics.
1	"""There are way to many amazing places to go to Bandera.  When calling in to make a reservation I was informed \they don't do that\"""" when asked what their corkage fee was.  The place had a normal busy Saturday night crowd but it seemed there staff was not trained for that.  We had multiple servers where we had to ask for menu's, silverware, drinks & plates. At one point even stopping a cook.\n\nThe food was ehh and no I would not go back.  Because like I said before there are way to many amazing places in the valley to go here."""""""
3	My favorite thing about this place way back in the day was it's famous BBQ Chicken Chipotle Pizza. It was by far the best tasting pizza I had ever had and was the main reason I went. \n\nI recently went back for old times sake at this location, and to my horrible dismay, they had replaced the style of that pizza with one that emulates how other restaurants had done it. No longer was the unique taste there, but instead, a water-down, blah-fest, full of corn. I'm not kidding - actual corn filled the pizza to the brim.\n\nDespite this, the beer here is great. Sometimes, on weekdays, they open the vats and filled the restaurant with the aroma of brewing, yeast infected beer. While this may make some of the more hardcore beer patrons happy, it usually sickens everyone else.\n\nThe prices are legit and I don't feel as though I'm getting molested by the waiters/waitresses. \n\nBack in the day, this place was a 5, now it's still a solid 3...but not much more.
4	"""I decided to take the wife out on a \date\"""". Zinc Bistro was the choice for dinner. Used Opentable for the reservation, flawless. We were seated right away and Sally our waitress was very good. We were in the courtyard to start but with the threat of rain she moved us inside.\n\nWe had the iceberg salad and onion soup for starters. And for entrees the flat iron steak with pomme frites and the short ribs with a potato gratin. WE shared a lemon souffle for dessert. The food was delicious. The portion of the short ribs seemed small until you realize the bones have been removed, all meat. But be aware the gratin has a strong nutmeg flavor. I liked it but was turned down by my wife.\n\nMy only disappointment was the background music selections. The decor is french bistro'ish, the food is french influenced then tell me why I had to listen to base pounding club music while eating dinner? Not the kind of background tunes you expect with this atmosphere. They should at least take note of the music they play on their website. I gave experience a 4 star because there are no half stars. Change the tunes and it's a solid 4 star."""""""
5	Walking in I felt like a kid in a delicious adult candy store! Although I've seen most of the beers before there were definitely a few new and interesting ones. They had  nice little selection of Utah beers, which are great if you've never had the pleasure. We bought some Flagstaff Lumberyard IPA, Abita Pecan Harvest, and a Bear Republic IPA. \n\nNow on to the good part: the downstairs! The setting is perfect. The beer selection is perfect. The prices are even pretty damn good. There was nothing on tap too tempting to me that night so I spent the night back and forth to the fridge choosing  bottles and presenting them to Frank, the awesome bartender. The bartender will open your beer and pour it into a glass. \n\nOverall, one of the best ways I can think of to spend a Saturday night. Cool people too, but the crowd was really small. As in, me, my husband, and two other couples. However, with  bartender as awesome as ours, you definitely don't need a crowd to keep you happy!
5	I had bought a used van from a long time family friend. I live in AZ but bought it from them in NM. Half way back to AZ the check engine light came on. Fearing the worst I looked on Yelp for an honest mechanic. Yelp did not lead me astray. I dropped the van off Tuesday night, after hours with a note explaining the situation and saying I was hoping it would pass emissions so I could register it in AZ. \n\nI spoke to Tim late on Wednesday and he told me it was a throttle position sensor and he would have it replaced that evening but wanted to make sure it would pass emissions and have it ready for me on Thursday by Noon. We had a situation come up where I needed to take the kids to daycare by 10am and needed the van to do so. I called Tim at 8am and asked if there was anyway he could have it ready by 10 instead of noon. He said he would see what he could do. At 9:30 he called me and said his guy was on his way back from the emissions testing location and the van passed and it's ready to go anytime. \n\nWOW I had no idea that he was going to take it himself to the emissions center. Talk about a double relief not only did I not have to worry about it passing but I didn't have to even go myself at all! Tim added on the emissions testing cost to the bill but added NOTHING to the price he quoted me the day before. I will definitely be bringing back any issues I have with my vehicles and recommending him to my friends.
5	Delicious food! Sweet potato fries are to die for, wish I could make them myself just like theirs. They come in a little mini-grocery cart, so cute! I remember we had these seasonal beer samplers - I think you get like five samples of beer or something; they tell you all about each one. Very cool. I like sitting outside so you can people-watch. Gelato Spot is a must afterward (100 feet away or so).  \n\nMy only complaint would be the size of the place. You are in close quarters with everyone and can't really get the intimate feel if you're on a date.
2	Melrose pharmacy is a charming locale, so long as you enjoy retro-tchotchkes and candy.  With pharmacies, it is with service and competent fulfillment of your 'script that the rubber meets the road.  I never got to do business with them, sadly, because of the following:\n\n--2 bungled phone calls, one where I was placed on hold for 15 minutes and forgotten when calling in about having a compounded medication made.  The 2nd phone call, the tech who took the call couldn't answer my questions competently.\n--Each time I spoke to somebody, the price for the Rx increased a few dollars.\n--Finally I drove to the pharmacy to get more information in person, and had to wait while the counter person spent far too long socializing with other people who didn't appear to be transacting any pharmacy business.  I finally interrupted the party, and I was boredly given a 3rd price for the prescription - higher than the previous 2 quotes - and was told that the person who could answer my other questions was unavailable.  I asked if this person could call me upon his return, and was told I would have to call back.  I was handed a marketing pamphlet for my trouble.\n\nAt which point I immediately took my business to another compounding pharmacy in North Phoenix.\n\nCasual business style is fine so long as it doesn't devolve into sloppiness and overt favoritism of your friends over new customers.  The proprietors are welcome to contact me.
4	Great Happy Hour deals on wine and some appetizers. We ordered a bottle of wine ($13.50!) that was delicious. We ordered the pesto caprese bruschetta ($5.00) and greek fries ($3.00) that were both on the happy hour menu.  The bruschetta was very nice, and greek fries were cooked well and crispy, but could have used more garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice for flavor.  The feta cheese used on the dishes was very tasty.  For meals, we ordered a falafel sandwich which was authentic with hummus and tehina that were nice, a chicken schwarma that was just right, and a pesto caprese burger which was outstanding. The desserts were good too, our favorite being the one with phyllo dough filled with mascarpone type cheese...mmm.  The prices were affordable, the staff were very friendly albeit a little slow, but it was a laid back enjoyable evening spent on the patio.
5	My friend took me to this place because we are both huge fans of micro brew beer. Papago Brewing has a magnificent and ever changing seletion of brews from all around the country including some of their own creations. I highly suggest the orange blossom, it is to die for. \n\nWe also had one of their Pizzas and ended up fighting over the last peice because it was so delicious. Great service and atmosphere capped off an already wonderful time, I will be going back often for sure.
4	"""We happened on this place after seeing a 40 min wait on a Tue at the \other wine cafe\"""", went right around the corner and glad we did.  For an appetizer we had the best wings in Phoenix; very tasty - baked, fresh Caesar salad.  We split a gluten-free Margherita pizza with fresh basil that was delicious.  The only reason La Grande Orange didn't get five stars is due to parking; however not having to give your car up to Postino's long valet line is a plus."""""""
4	I've sadly become one of those people who turn to the Food Network for restaurant recommendations. Okay, not all the time but when a segment airs about thick cut bacon and huge burger patties cooked in butter, I immediately start making travel plans.\n\nWe arrived at Matt's for a late-lunch. Being that it was a weekday and close to 2pm, the restaurant was nearly empty and we didn't have to endure the wait or the harried service. In fact, other than a mix-up with toast, the staff was attentive and eager to please (or get us out so they could go home).\n\nI ordered the jalapeno burger with kettle chips and Jules got the Hog & Chick - 2 eggs with bacon. Her hash browns were buttery and sweet. My burger was juicy with a nice kick.\n\nI don't know if I'll jump on the plane the next time I see a tempting food segment but am I glad that we made a trip for some bacon and burger? You bet.
5	We attended a private event here on the upstairs patio, which they had rented out. My review pertains to this experience, which included drinks and appetizers. I can not comment on actual meals, or wait service. \n\nThe patio itself was cute ,with its own bar upstairs, and the ambiance was lovely at the sunset hour. Everything here is TRENDY and we liked the lollipop chicken, bacon/Ruben melts, and artichoke dip. \n\nThe drinks were great and I liked my margaritas a lot. The bartender was friendly and made drinks quickly. I think this woukld be a great area t consider renting out for a rehearsal dinner or work event.
5	"""Smeeks is enough to make any grown adult throw a tantrum, drool sugary syrup down the front of their white T-shirt and spend their entire allowance.\n\nThe tiny corner shop has an entire spectrum of peculiar and obscure candies, toys and gifts in a carnival jamboree setting.

3	My review for this place is going to be a little odd. I didn't stay here, I was an exhibitor at a convention here.\n\nPros: \nNice Meeting/Ballrooms. Plenty of space for a smaller convention to hold its events.\nPer the Con organizers it was the right price too.\n\nCons:\n\nLocation - In Tempe, tucked away, people were saying they had to drive by 3 or 4 times to find it.\nParking - fills quickly and then you have pay to park for overflow. The convention was NOT the Phoenix Comic Con and people do not want to have to pay to park.\nStaff - They did not have the rooms ready on time as they agreed upon with the Convention organizers. \nRestaurant - Little pricey.\n\n\nSo why you ask do I give this place 3 stars? I am so glad you asked that question.\n\nBecause any of the actual hotel staff I dealt with were really nice and helpful. The convention staff/organizers short of only 2 people were extremely poor. So telling where the fail here was is pretty hard but the more I dug into it the more I would say the convention organizers were at fault.\n\nWould I stay here as a hotel? If the price was right, absolutely.
5	Long story short, the quote to do the maintenance and a few repairs on my RX at Bell Lexus was $800 less than at Scottsdale Lexus and they could guarantee me an RX loaner (I needed the rear air and room for the stroller). Now I'm frugal so I would have driven all the way up there from Ahwatukee to save $100 but $800! That's crazy! Not only that, but they found things that Scottsdale Lexus didn't find and they were real, honest-to-god problems because my car quit making the exhaust leak sound after they fixed it (when it never had an exhaust leak). I'll definitely keep driving up there. It's farther away but it's by far worth it for the quality of service and the savings.
3	I have eaten at pita jungle a few times in the past, each time has been an overall good experience... the food has almost always been delicious, with the exception of one botched sweet chicken lavosh pizza(bit burnt).... Their pitas and hummus are always an excellent choice as a starter before your meal.... or even as a cheap meal if you're exceptionally poor i suppose...\n\nmenu is a bit flooded with vegetarian and vegan foods, however some dishes do include meat... I suppose it caters to the crowd that tends to frequent the place, usually see alot of the indie/tree-hugger types... It's only further proven by the 'for sale' art on the walls...\n\nIt's a good eat... but i tend to take mine to go...
4	I swore off Sprint stores after several bad experiences in the Bay Area. After my trials, I I then decided to only work with Sprint by phone or online for any issues that I had. \n\nUpon moving to the Phoenix area, I was told the Sprint store in Tempe was different. My opinion has now changed, at least for this Sprint store and the Technial shop next door. \n\nI've had to go to this location a few times when my phone was having some issues a few months back. My phone issues were resolved and the customer service was very good each time. The staff was very nice and helpful. A big change from my previous experiences.\n\nI went to the Sprint store on 11/27 to combine my plan with my wifes' plan. The store was pretty busy since this was Black Friday. Even with all the people, we were able to meet with a customer service rep within a few minutes and were still in and out of the store within 15 to 20 minutes. \n\nI received a new Sprint phone as a gift yesterday and I had to head to the Sprint store to get the phone activated and transfer over my contact list. I was very pleased with the process. The duration of my time in the store was less than 10 minutes.
4	On a receommendation - we went to CC...was told that the chopped salad is to DIE for!  No joke - get this salad.   It is the best.  People that don't even eat salad eat this.\n\nI also had the mushroom and the crab.  Crab needed some acid and the mushroom was great - except where were the cool mushrooms.  They listed lobster, black trumpet, yellow foot, etc...and all I ate were portobello and button.  Nothing wrong with that, but if those other shrooms are really not going to be in there, then don't list it and I'll eat something else.  Dessert was ok as well.  Their shining star - for sure that dang salad!\n\nOur server was awesome too - loved her!
2	I wanted to like Bison Witches.  \n\nUnfortunately, the best thing Bison Witches has going for it is its clever name. \n\nLet's start with the high points.  The sandwiches are large--the half sandwich is easily what you'd make for yourself at home and would call a sandwich.  The menu has a pretty large selection of sandwiches, and there are some other options, like soup and some appetizers.  There's a fair bit of outdoor seating to enjoy the gorgeous spring weather.  And, if you like beer, they've got a pretty good selection, even sporting a Hoegaarden on tap (a personal favorite).  They have some pretty decent happy hour specials... as such, if you're looking to waste away an afternoon hanging out with your friends, chatting over a few beers, and enjoying the day, you could do worse (especially being near Mill Ave.)\n\nThe place is really more bar than sandwich shop--the inside is a rectangular space lined with booths, with a a square bar in the middle surrounded by free-standing tables.  A couple of TVs strewn around the bar is a nod to a sports-bar environment, though I wouldn't ever visit with the real intention of watching a game.  As for the booth we sat in, it was broken, and I spent a fair bit of my time moving the seat back in place and wondering if it would tip it over.   \n\nAs renowned as the sandwiches are, I was disappointed to find them to be all bread.  The bread is fairly enjoyable, actually, as it's fresh and the slices are sizable and toasted.  But when they pair it with the rest of the sandwich, it's really not much to write home about.  I didn't feel any desire to try another sandwich after sampling the beef & brie on wheat--a little too sweet, too much bread.  My friend was none-to-impressed with her club, an easy sandwich that should please all comers.  The service was mediocre at best, perhaps bordering on curt a couple times, but I did appreciate their leaving us to be and drink for some time after we finished eating.\n  \nYou could do worse with your time and money, but you could certainly do better.  I wouldn't make plans to go to Bison Witches again, but I might go there again if pressed.  Certainly I'd be happy to sit there and throw back a couple Hoegaardens with friends and not worry about all the stuff I should really be doing...
5	Talk about spoiled rotten! My lovely date, Angy B., and I walked into the private party space and were immediately greeted with champagne. That's how you know you've hit it big. I could barely get my nametag on before we were happily sipping our way to the tables. After the nearby chairs filled with more joyous Elites, Larry, the manager of iPic, took a seat and explained a little more about what was to come... plus shared some incredible stories. Hilarious stories! I'll have to come back to hear some more of those stories.\n\nFood started being passed around and I would list all of them, but I'm pretty sure you'd rather salivate over the pictures instead. I WILL, however, tell you which my favorites were: the savory prosciutto and olive platter, crispy tempura fried brussell sprouts, incredible pan-seared scallops, delicious braised short rib, and the heavenly red velvet bread pudding dessert (and I don't even like bread pudding!). I still can't believe that's not even the half of it! Michael, the General Manager of Tanzy, sat next to me and gave us some very detailed descriptions of each plate that came out, but we insisted that our server, Isaiah, would come by and give us his version. He was so passionate about describing every piece in the most mouth-watering way! Sorry, Michael :)\n\nLet's at least touch on those wines. OH. MY. STARS. Those were real pours! Riesling, pinot noir, chardonnay, syrah/shiraz, and that final red... maybe a zinfandel? Perfect! If our glasses were empty, Michael or Larry was there making sure they were refilled by Darren. Angy and I pulled ourselves away from all things yummy to go participate in the White Elephant gift exchange and laughed our way through Lindsey picking the mooning gnome (which was stolen by a girl with the last name of Butts! Well deserved), met some more Yelpers, and walked away with some neat gifts. \n\nWhat a night! THANKS TO EVERYONE! Tanzy, iPic, Yelp, and of course Lindsey! I can't wait to take Angy on another date to iPic with our super fancy complimentary tickets and grab some Tanzy food to say hi to our new friends. Because you know I need some more of those scallops.
3	"""This is a really cute non-scene place perfect for a casual drink. I can't quite recommend the food as it wasn't available. I say this while trying not to shout out \moronic service\"""" based on my experience tonight. Thanks to the magic of Instagram I know we arrived at 10:15PM. After taking our drink order our server stopped by twice and inquired if we had any questions about the menu. \n\nAt 10:25 I was unable to place an order as \""""the kitchen closed at 10PM\"""".\n\nUm, ok?\n\nEither the kid doesn't own a watch or is in la la land. Another ding for not asking if we wanted another round the 2nd time he stopped by...and only asking when we had money piled on the table as we were clearly ready to leave. \n\nBummer of a disappointment."""""""
5	LOVE the chandler location!\n\nParking is definitely easier than the Tempe location!\n\nThe lady at the counter was super helpful. I kept forgetting the flavors and she went over everything with me...even twice! \n\nI wanted to bring some paletas home (I live 15 minutes away) and she was super helpful in packing them for me. They give you ice when you take home the yummy popiscles, delicious!!\n\nI love this location and the paletas - they are delicious, unique and full of fresh fruit/flavors. LOVE IT! BRING IT TO CALIFORNIA! \n\nCali needs some of this!
2	I grew up going to this theater. All of the amenities are standard and seats are comfortable. However, I am 26 years old. I will concede that I have a young face but getting ID'd at the ticket booth for a rated R movie is mildly laughable. It went from laughable to annoying when a young teenage girl wanted to see my ID and ticket stub before allowing us to take our seats. Just so you know, we were seeing Youth in Revolt not Showgirls.
4	"""I returned here recently for lunch.My girl wanted to have a lunch \date\"""" since we would be traveling in separate universes for the next six weeks. No half nelson required. I had been dreaming of pupusas and ensalda since trying this out for the first time a week earlier.\n\nShe did a version of when Harry met Sally, and had what I had last time out. (You thought she faked the big \""""O\"""" didn't you?) She pronounced the relleno, one of the best versions she had ever tasted.\n\nThe big \""""O\"""" was me after eating the pupusa, covered in the slightly sweet, spicy cabbage condiment. No faking required. Pure bliss.I had a pork dish, which included some of the best plantains I had ever put a tongue to. Shiver me chicharr\u00f3n this is some good tasting food."""""""
4	So today was my first time ever getting waxed. Now you can probably guess I'm not talking eyebrows. As everyone mentioned, it's spotless which is important. They didn't try to hard up sell me, but they did talk me into some serum that I question I need, but I did like the way it felt on my tender skin. My girl was Alex and she was fantastic. Very informative and made me feel very comfortable. Also she looked like a younger Rachel Weisz with tattoos
2	Hmmm....where do I start...SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! \n\nHonestly, if you don't mind paying through the ear for a mediocre meal, then feel free and pay a visit, but don't say yelp reviewers didn't give you fair warning. \n\nSo I was taken here for my birthday, and I was super excited! I had heard good reviews and could not wait to get my hands on some stew chicken!! \n\nWe started out with the drink menu, the mango drink with mint is very good and reasonably priced compared to everything on the menu. \n\nSince we heard the portions were small, we decided we would each get an app, share, and then each order entrees. \n\nThe Festival with mango chutney...taste was good, price was ridiculous!!!!!! They seriously make 2 tiny breadsticks, cut them in half and stick it in a small bowl of chutney. I don't care what fancy ingredients you use, but for $5.95, at least add some more breadsticks!!! \n\nThe plantain and avocado rolls were also small, the plantain was not even fully ripened, and the cost was $7.95..., these ingredients are not fancy, or expensive, and the flavor was disappointing. \n\nI decided that I was going to get the the jamaican patty with fish, but after being slightly confused by the waitress I ended up ordering the chefs special appetizer...OMG what a MISTAKE!!! \n\nThe chef's special was fish springrolls with mango and spinach(or some other green) served with a spicy sauce...the flavor was bitter and it needed more fish...especially when I saw the price after the bill came..12.50!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for the smallest spring rolls in the world, and the fish in it? Probably the scraps left over after they get the filets off the bone for an entree. \n\nThe stew chicken that I was soo excited about? ehhh...i've made better with a half ass recipe. \n\nThe only thing I found that was rare and delicious, was a boiled green banana that is hard to find in phoenix. Although a roasted sweet potato or yam would have fit in as well. \n\nThe curry chicken and dumpling is a joke! you get about 4- 5 small pieces of a cut chicken breast and a big dense dumpling, I was afraid to take too much when I asked if i could taste, so i took a sliver or chicken and a sliver of dumpling....not impressed. \n\nThe rice and plantain on the plate was ok, but again, the plantain was not fully ripened. \n\nThe best thing on my plate was grilled piece of cabbage and the boiled banana. \n\nNow that I think of it, for a restaurant that is is focused on local ingredients and the experience of eating your food etc...why the heck would they serve mangoes, plantains, and green bananas and anything with fish for that matter...seems at odds with the philosophy \n\nAll in all, 3 diners, 0 repeat customers. \n\nThe space is nice, the service is friendly. \n\nFood is ok, prices are ridiculous. \nI would not recommend it to my friends.
5	A couple of things about my recent visit.\n\nFirst of all, I had the Teriyaki Brown Rice, Local Vegetables, Sesame & Avocado with Tofu.  Since I'm vegan, it was one of the options conveniently marked as such.  And it was delicious!  Flavorful and hearty, I truly enjoyed it.\n\nI took my mother here for her birthday, and both my mother and brother enjoyed it.  I've been a couple of times for lunch, and I have enjoyed it, but neither my mom nor brother eat a lot of food that follows this concept.  My brother, a near carnivore, liked the steak tacos, but thought that the tortilla was bland.  We ordered a bottle of delicious wine, and thoroughly enjoyed the strawberry hemp-milk ice cream.  That should definitely become a permanent selection, because I am vegan and I did not see another vegan dessert option.\n\nAnd finally, the waiters and staff were awesome.  Our waiter was friendly, polite, and incredibly helpful.  I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for some local selections, a unique mix of (mostly) healthier food, and anyone wanting to enjoy a good meal.
3	We went late on a Sunday afternoon and just made it in time for their lunch specials. Three mini tacos was the perfect amount of food and it allowed me to try three different kinds. I got the steak, shrimp, and chicken tacos. The steak and chicken were really good, the shrimp taco was good too, but I'm partial to the Baja Fresh shrimp taco-that one is my favorite. My boyfriend got the carnitas taco and said it was really good too. I wasn't too impressed with the salsas. The green one was my favorite. The atmosphere was great for either a quiet afternoon lunch, but I could also see it being a really fun place for night life too! I can't wait to go back and order a margarita! I love the simple, straight-forward menu and the extremely reasonable prices. Our server/bartender was very nice too!
3	If you go to Tott's enough times the GM will eventually know you by name. He's always there and lives on a cot located in the back room.\n\nIf you bring a date he'll know her by her name too and he'll have no qualms flirting with her. \n\nStill, shouldn't every Mom n' Pop restaurant in your neighborhood be like that? \n\nTott's has more ambiance than your average Mom n' Pop place. I kind of see it as a small corporate place that just isn't named Pei Wei. After all, the restaurant is connected to Starbucks. \n\nRemember, this isn't a Chinese restaurant. It tries to cover the Asian gamut by offering some choices of Thai and Japanese food. You won't find sushi here, but you can get a big bowl of udon and there are a variety of thai curry sauces to choose from. \n\nI usually get take out from here but it's got an elegant little dining area and the outside patios with its metal tables really are quite nice when the weather allows. The dark wood tables and non-traditional flooring makes you feel like you're eating in a place fancier than you really are. \n\nTott's has raised its prices more than once over the last few years though. Pei Wei moving into the same parking lot didn't help matters. \n\nAlso, the workers who you see on the same regular basis are not nearly as friendly as the GM is. It's not that they're nasty, but you don't have to ask me my name on a take out order if I just paid with a credit card (with my name on it) or if I've been there (and seen you) multiple times that month. \n\nPeople I've taken there like his personal, friendly approach and enjoy the food. Tott's serves some non-traditional dishes though and it's not for everyone. \n\nTwins Pork has jalepenos and bacon. The Lo Mein has somewhat of a smoky flavor to it that I think blows YC's out of the water. Also, some of these dishes are spicier than people are used to at a Chinese restaurant. Other dishes are very thick and syrupy over meat (stir fried crispy beef). \n\nThere are a number of items I really enjoy on the menu. I notice that portions differ though. My black plastic box on take out never seems to be all the way stuffed and lunch specials are made to be bigger than they are by giving you half a plate of rice. \n\nWhen prices go up and I feel I'm getting lesser portions I have an issue. \n\nI've also never heard of paying extra for friend rice with a lunch special until I started eating here. The brown rice, which is free, is good though. \n\nI don't eat here as often as I used to. It's tough to pay nearly $9 without a drink and not be completely filled up on a take out order. \n\nI find that some of the thai dishes tend to be very saucy and are more of a value. \n\nI give it 3.5 stars. A few years back I would have said 4.5, but it's just become less of a bang for your buck and in these recessionary times, that matters.
1	I was visiting Phoenix a few weeks ago and I visited this bookstore. Although they have a nice selection and the prices are fair, I had a disturbing incident with a man I assume was one of the owners. I was looking at a group of books on the shelves and there happened to be a desk nearby which I stayed away from.\nI continued looking and the man came running over to me and told me in a very harsh tone that the books in that area were not to be looked at. The area I was in just looked like a regular part of the store and there was nothing stating that the section was off limits. The man was so rude and so hysterical that it completely embarrassed me and made me feel like I was doing something terribly wrong. I told the man that he should rope off any areas he didn't want the customers to look at and he agreed. But I left feeling very angry and embarrassed and didn't purchase the books that I had intended to buy.
4	The Oregano's Gilbert is a brand new location. Great news for Oregano-lovers on this side of town. Great news for anyone looking for yummy pizza and pasta and a warm, friendly setting.\n\nOregano's has a fun, retro look, and the patio dining is recommended except for the warmest months of the year. Their menu offers the typical choices: salads, breads, wings, pizza, pasta plus some original takes on traditional Italian dishes. The soups are definitely a cut above what most Itallian eateries offer -- wait, most DON'T offer. Try the Jumbo Gumbo or Itallin Wedding Soup, both are terrific.
2	"""If it wasn't for the cute shopping cart of fries, they'd get a one star. Went in an hour after they opened today so it wasn't busy at all. All the servers and host were standing around looking bored out of their mind. My server was nowhere to be found so I waved down a server that was standing right next to me with nothing to do, he shook his head at me and replied \I'm not your server,\"""" and went back to staring at the damn ceiling before asking if he could help me with anything. I couldn't read his name tag but I think his name was Ali or ali-something. Finally my server showed up after a few minutes and took my order. If it wasn't for my friend wanting to try this \""""popular\"""" place, I would had walked out of there. Overall, service was below a one star.\n\nAs for the food, I got the delux burger since it was their popular item with an order of sweet potato fries. I ordered the burger medium well and it came out way over cooked. It was extremely bland, I had to add a lot of salt and pepper just to finish half of the burger. Oh, the BACON was nowhere to be found in my burger. Over $10 for this dinky tasteless burger? I rather go to in-n-out. The fries was okay since the sauce was good. My friend got the chicken panini sandwich, which she said was nothing special. With that price, you could've gotten much better for less elsewhere.\n\n\nOverall, we're never coming back."""""""
1	With 4 stars on yep I was hoping for a tasty breakfast but after a long wait I got a plate of overcooked eggs, weird tasting greasy bacon, completely undercooked potatoes (how hard is it to cook taters until they are brown?) and the toast they served tasted just like the greasy grill, terrible. It was all really inedible as was the Menudo that my girlfriend ordered. Disgusting. Also people are in there at 10am drinking large beers, very weird place. Is it a restaurant, store, bar? Not sure.. I am sure it sucks though and I will never go back.
1	I used to love the Good Egg. My husband and I were regulars but after the ratio of bad meals went from 1 out of 10 to 5 out of 10 then 9 out of 10, we're done. \n\nThe service is lousy: If they mess-up or forget your order, you get nothing more than a half apology. \n\nThe food is bland and poorly cooked: Their eggs are unseasoned and sauces are made from powder mix. Their poached eggs are watery making whatever they put them on a runny mess.\n\nTheir prices are high and getting higher: Many dishes $10 and no longer come with potatoes. You have to buy your side for an additional $1. Their not-so-clever attempt to raise prices without anyone noticing is insulting to our intelligence.\n\nI am casting my vote to stop bad breakfast in Arizona. I will never eat at Good Egg again. They need to go out and make room for people who actually care about putting out a good plate of food.
5	"""Let me begin by telling you about my horribly debilitating fear of going to the dentist.  It's epic.  Weeks before an appointment I start having nightmares.  Thinking about sitting in the dental chair makes me break out in a cold sweat.  I require nitris oxide for a simple cleaning. The sound of the drill is enough to make me want to claw my face off.  Basically, every visit has been the worst experience ever for the past 30 years....\n\nEnter Dr. Marcia Blazer.  I read about her online when searching for a local dentist here in Scottsdale.  I literally googled \dentists for anxious patients\"""", and her name popped up.  Her website appeared too good to be true.  They offered nitris (plus), offered non invasive options for dental procedures (double plus), and offered a staff used to accomodating those with a healthy dose of dental fear.\n\nI went in for my first visit (a cleaning and exam), and I was amazed at how comfortable they made me feel.  They were warm and friendly, and put me at ease immediately.  During the cleaning, my least favorite part is always when they use the scrapy,pointy torture device to stab off all the plaque at the gumline.  How happy was I when they used an air abrasion tool instead...felt like a cool stream of water on your teeth, and BAM, they're clean!  They were so calming, that when I was informed that I had 2 cavities, I didn't even have a panic attack at the thought of coming in.\n\nFast forward two weeks to my filling appointment.  I had requested nitris (hey, I was feeling better but still SUPER anxious), which they had all set up in the room for me when I walked in.  Now here's my favorite part.  As I sat in the chair, the assistant brought over two big boxes full of dvd's and asked me what movie I would like to watch during the procedure...What?? So I picked a lighthearted comedy (50 First Dates).  I was then given noise eliminating headphones to use (goodbye horrible drilling sound), nitris (hello happy gas), and a few hand signals to recognize if I was supposed to open or close my mouth.  And we were off!  She didn't try to maintain conversation (soooo annoying when dentists do that), and before I knew it she was done and I was disappointed because my movie wasn't quite over!  I was even told that had my dentist not needed the room I was in for another patient, that I would have been welcome to stay and just finish the movie!\n\nI have had several interactions with this office since then (regarding billing and follow up), and every time it is a pleasure to deal with them.  I highly recommend this office to anyone!"""""""
5	This is my 99 cent store that I go to for all my 99 cent needs.  It's not in the best of neighborhoods and there is always someone asking for money or selling something in front of the store, but I just ignore and do my thing.  I like their selection of food, makeup, cleaning supplies, and toiletries.  Oh and their selection of spices!  They have a lot of good cooking spices here.  Love it!  Their store and bathrooms are clean.  The cashiers are really nice and helpful.\n\n\nI like it, I love it, I want some more of it.......
4	I'd been hearing about Postinos from some food snob friends of mine so I decided to try it out this past Friday night.  Got there at 7 p.m. and scored a table with no wait in the middle of the dining room.  Immediately I realized it was a little too loud for the audience with the music playing, but stuck it out.  I was meeting my friend's parents who were in town on vacation and thought it would be a nice, casual place with hopefully great wine and food.  They loved the architecture inside, with the exposed pipes and brick and large, open garage doors.  The patio was probably not quite as loud, but was full so we were definitely stuck inside.  \n\nI had a glass of $11 Malbec, which was fantastic.  We ordered the bruschetta and I im in love with the artichoke version as well as the apple and brie.  I was not blown away by the mozzerella and tomato, which I thought I had heard was a guaranteed good time.  I also got the turkey panini though which I got with a salad.  It was bigger than any panini I've ever had and I took half of it home.  It had  a pesto sauce that made it the best panini I think I've had in my lifetime.  (Maybe I've had ten paninis though in my lifetime so take it for what it's worth.)  The salad I was not blown away by and was not disappointed when the waiter took it away while asking if he could take it away.\n\nService was a little slow, but again it was a Friday night.  The wait staff is a friendly, helpful group and didn't rush us as we sat and chatted while eating for three hours.  \n\nValet is $3, which is fair, but what is a riot is when you walk out, if you had your keys, you could walk the twenty feet and get your car yourself.  But instead, you have to wait behind five people for the valet to hand you your keys and THEN you walk to your car.  AFTER tipping of course:)\n\nOverall, I will go back for the paninis, maybe try a few other bruschettas.  It will be hard to not to to LGO next door though...
4	This restaurant gives you a lot of food for the price. We ordered the mushi pork, pan fried noodles and mixed vegetables with black mushrooms. The mushi pork was great  but the pan fried noodles were overwhelmed with the sauce. The mixed vegetables was okay I should have ordered my favorite, Chinese broccoli. We brought half of the food home except for the mushi pork that we devoured.\nOne thing I really disliked was the plastic chopsticks. It was a test to see how much food you could get to your mouth before the food would slide off the chopstick.
5	"""So, a guy walks into a UPS Store with a Scuba Suit...\n\nYes, this actually happened last week while I'm filling in the forms that I had emailed ( my printer died last week) over to The UPS Store near Tarbell's and Sportsman's on 32nd & Camelback.  The guy was shipping the suit and was very concerned about insuring it.  \No problem\"""" says 1 0f the 2 men college age guys working there.\n\nIn the meantime, I also had to copy my AZ Drivers License and a Thai Massage Certificate (proof of 25 hours of CEU's) for my AZ Massage License.  And here is the cool part and why they receive a fiver in this review, No Charge For The Printing!  It is less than a buck, I get that, but it is also a simple gesture of great service.  \n\nSo... does anyone know of a great, inexpensive tech that can fix my dead HP printer?"""""""
2	"""I think giving this 2 stars is being generous.  For a chocolate affair, there really wasn't a whole lot of chocolate vendors.  It was pretty disappointing.  There's a whole bunch of these type of \festivals\"""" throughout the year and we've been to two of them (the Glitter lights being the other) and both times I have been thoroughly disappointed.  Parking sucks and PRICEY which i wouldn't mind if they weren't such a huge disappointment.  \n\nThe choco vendors that were there I guess was pretty good but I'd say maybe 30-40% of the vendors there had anything to do with chocolate.  Boo.  :("""""""
5	"""It was great. In fact, I'm near speechless... The guides were VERY respectful while still being laid back and personable. Great at pairing horses to individuals' backgrounds so if you're more experienced, you have the opportunity to be with a horse that likes a faster gait. We only had four people plus a guide so it made everything much more personalized than the traditional \nose to butt\"""" trail. Went through forest, open land, over logs, up/down hills, through rivers... the experience was BEYOND amazing. Nothing dull about this ride especially because we were able to trot or even gallop, if we wanted to. Will DEFINITELY be back to ride with them in Paulden, AZ!!!!!"""""""
4	"""Ahwatukee and Chandler can not have enough Italian restaurants.  That was sarcasm.\n\nSo when this one gets four stars its the sign of a good thing.\n\nItems I really like:\nAppetizers: (my favorite part to any meal)\nFried zucchini - thinly sliced and lightly friend with a great dipping sauce.\nFried calamari - fresh and again lightly breaded and fried. Must have the spicy pepper and lemon butter sauce.  Must.\n\nEntree's\nSpiedino Di Mare: Scallops and shrimp are perfectly cooked.\nChicken Marsala - wonderful mushrooms and sauce.\n\nI enjoy both their vinegrette and creamy Italian for the salad starter.\n\nI recommend the lenti and sausage soup should you feel like something warm andn spicy.  Very yummy in your tummy.\n\nThey are a \scratch\"""" kitchen as they call it, which means they can accommodate any food dislikes or allergies.\n\nIt's kind of dark in the dinning area but comfortable."""""""
5	Was here on a Friday night. It was a default restaurant, because the one I wanted to go to was no longer there. This place was packed and was an hour long wait. I grumbled and whined, because I thought it was going to be like the Olive Garden. Boy was i wrong! The service was awesome. While the crowd waited, they passed out pizza samples and made sure everyone that wanted one got one. Once seated our server Clint (shout out to Clint!) was the best waiter I have ever encountered. Even though the restaurant was packed, he sat down to explain all the good things to order. We ended getting a small greek salad, Half Mama spinato & The Combo pizza, and a small cheese pizza. Everything was delicious. Shockingly, the stand out was the Cheese pizza. Will definitley be back to this place. Don't let the long wait scare you away. It's worth it.
4	i'm a huge fan of Roy's and have eaten at several locations throughtout the US. Went to the chandler location for fathers day had gift cards to use so started at the bar with the $5 happy hour menu and drinks. the Hawaiian Martini is great and wonderful choices on the food side we had spicy tuna roll. ..preceded to the dining room for dinner and did the spring prix fix for $39 each salad, entree and dessert. we shared the meals 2 salads 2 entrees had the fish and hanger steak. and both desserts. everything was good..service, pace of the dinner  & atmosphere. ..we had 1 small problem when the steak came out ice cold cook correctly but the plate also cold as the server placed it on the table saying extreemly hot be carefull ..once i was able to let the server know the problem they went into lets fix this mode. although we choose to take the steak to go the manager came over and gave us 2 $20 gift cards and then at the end of the meal took another $20 off the bill. nice job i'll be back and i recommend giving them a try..hawaiian fused food in AZ makes u want to hope a plane for MAui...
3	Don't get me wrong, White Chocolate Grill is good and definitely a place I will go back to, but there is something that just doesn't click. Everything tastes good and the service is fast and efficient but it is more of a relaxed dinner that a meal you get excited about. I can't say for everyone I really don't like waiting a half hour for a table. Call me impatient I don't care,  I really do not think many restaurants deserve that title even on a Friday night. I do love that they have an entire menu for gluten free diners. It's so hard to find gluten free in restaurants don't even mention an entire menu! I was impressed! I ended up splitting artichokes with parmesan (ask for no bread crumbs) with my mom and got myself a chicken caesar. Both were decent. We did end up ordering a gluten free chocolate souffl\u00e9 (make sure to specify that you want it gluten free because they had a normal version as well) which was amazing and I would definitely go there just for that. Overall a good family weeknight restaurant that is that is above average meal. Definitely a place to go if you have celiacs or are gluten intolerant.
3	"""The fianc\u00e9's and my first place together in Phoenix was just down the street from this place and we thought we lucked out when we found out we lived so close to this Gallo Blanco.  I was searching for an apartment for us since we were moving from Texas and I remember calling her saying 'you won't believe what I found next to this apartment I just checked out'.  It had a positive influence on our decision to move into the nearby apartment complex.  But after the first few visits, the curtains feel down and what was revealed was a sort of shock to us.\n\nMeal:  I usually stuck to the tacos and chilaquiles.  The fianc\u00e9 went for the tacos and the burritos.  And like clockwork, we always started our meal with dressed Tecates.  We would get cocktails everyone once in a while in the evenings with chips and salsa.\n\nTaste:  The food is hit or miss here, and I am not talking about comparing menu item to menu item.  It is more of a \if you don't like the beef taco on Tuesday, they might be made right on Friday\"""".  There was no consistency.  Some occasions, it was the perfect meal.  Some occasions, it didn't taste that good.  The cocktails are decent but they are nothing to write home to momma about.  7 out of 10.\n\nValue:  The food a little pricey end of the spectrum, but I have come accustomed to that when going to hipster-like restaurants.  Drinks prices are ok.  It is just . . . an ok value.  3 out of 5.\n\nService/Cleanliness:  I really like the servers.  They are always in a good spirit, are nice and polite.  Sometimes they are a little slow and I have noticed they sometimes get caught up in conversations with other workers in the kitchen, but it wasn't as egregious as some other places I have visited.  But I had one meal that was littered with what I hope was human hair.  It was like my tacos were giving birth to a chewbaca.  YAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNN (Chewy sound effect).  That was the last time I went to Gallo Blanco and I will never go back for that reason. 6 out of 10.\n\nAtmosphere:  The high point of Gallo Blanco is the atmosphere.  It has a great patio.  It is located in a cool boutique hotel.  The decorating was very simply stated but it wasn't meek.  It was spot on.  5 out of 5.\n\nOverall:  Oh you white rooster, you broke my heart.  This could have been one of those places my fianc\u00e9 and I would drive half way across the valley to visit after we moved.  But it wasn't meant to be.  21 out of 30 points.  3 out of 5 stars."""""""
4	I'm native to Phoenix and have been eating this brand of tortillas my entire life.  I guess my taste buds have adapted because no other tortilla brand compares.  Red Eagle brand laughs in the face of Mission Tortillas!  So when my father-in-law came to visit from the East Coast and asked for some authentic tortillas to take home I knew where to go.  You can buy a regular pack at grocery stores but the factory sells larger quantites which is what we wanted for him to take home.  We purchase several dozen tortillas and tamales and they were a hit back in Pennsylvania!  Thanks for not disappointing Red Eagle!
5	Ill try not to talk it up too much but I have to say it was one of the best dinning experiences I've ever had. My wife and I stopped in and were really surprised on how authentic the inside of the restaurant looked. The meal was perfect and the service was out of this world friendly. Even the owner took time to sit and talk with us and share stories.  I thought places like this only existed in movies. Thanks Zur Kate for the good time and we are looking forward to visiting your fine establishment again!!!
4	"""I had known about the Farm, but in all my years living in the valley (I'm a Phoenix native, so there's a lot of years there ;), I had yet to go.  We had a \Mommy Day\"""" planned (two out of the three are/were pregnant and the day consisted of breakfast, mani/pedis, and finished up with a baby shower.) which started out at MGC.  \n\nThe second pregnant pal suggested we go to MGC for breakfast and everyone readily agreed.  When we arrived, our orders were taken swiftly.  I must say that they are very accommodating at MGC.  I had asked if I could order hard boiled eggs instead of scrambled/fried for my breakfast and they were more than happy to oblige my breakfast revision.  \n\nMy only quibble is the fact that we were not aware that you had to pay for the self-serve beverages.  After trying/disliking the lemonade, I went back for ice tea.  Thankfully, I was only charged for one.  \n\nCan not wait to go back once MGC opens back up this fall!"""""""
4	If there was a half star, Centurion would get 4.5 stars.\n\nI was slightly skeptical at first when there was just the chef and waitress in the restaurant.  Considering this was a Saturday night, I thought I didn't get the memo that this was a lunch-oriented place and not the place to be for dinner.  I was so glad to be wrong, for once and only for once.\n\nThey warmly greeted us as we entered.  We were so hungry that we started out with their cheese plate.  It was a nice assortment of manchego, double-creamed brie, and since i mentioned I loved blue, the chef gave us their blue that was not even on the menu.  You get to choose 3 cheeses out of 6-9 choices.  The cheese plate was nicely arranged with fruits (grapes, strawberries) and nuts.  In addition, he added fig jam and Dijon mustard that gave it a nice kick.  Compared to other restaurants in the valley, it was one of the nicer cheese plates and selections.\n\nNext, on to 3 different kinds of risotto (coconut and shrimp, chorizo and manchego, white truffle), which were very rich.  The food just kept coming with our filet mignon, lamb, and halibut (entree for 2).  I know it was a lot of food for the 2 of us but I just had to try it all.  The filet mignon was good but although ordered rare, it was more on the medium rare side for me.  The sauce that was made for the lamb was fantastic; however, I've had a better cut of lamb.\n\nIt had a nice ambiance; however, the benches were very high and we had to move to another table.  Thankfully, the chef was aware of the issue and they are anticipating taking care of it.  The patio was really cute and inviting and will be a perfect place to grab a drink (once they get liquor license) after the weather becomes cool. \n\nThe chef was very personable and we will be back  to try his recommendation of the Espana pizza.  I hope others will try this place to keep it going because it's a wonderful independent restaurant that Phoenix needs!
3	Well, it's 4 stars sometimes--5 stars when I find a fabulous $250 outfit for $60 or $150 shoes for $12, and like 2 stars when all I can dig up is a tank top that magically becomes a tied-dyed piece the first time I wash it! So the average would be something like 3.148678562567 or something like that [hey, isn't that pi??]\n\nYes, shoppers, we're talking about -- Last Chance. And it truly IS the last chance for some of this pathetic stuff that's left over from Nordstrom's, Norstrom's Rack and for returns that they can no longer legally sell as new. But that means more goodies for those intrepid shoppers willing to wade through the sludge and fur-encrusted sequined hot pants to get to the Really Good Stuff....\n\nI've learned to follow the truck up to the back of the Colonnade, then be first to sort through the stuff as soon as it hits! Also, if you go there often you'll have a much better chance of getting the good buys.\n\nOTOH--it's a mess there, stuff never gets put back where it should be, be VERY AFRAID of rips, tears and missing parts and keep your personal items well protected. I usually don't even carry a purse, just my stuff crammed in my pockets--there's definitely been an increase in sleazeoids there lately and pickpockets are really good at lifting your stuff when you're too busy sorting through stuff to notice!
3	"""I want to love you, Alice Cooperstown, I really do. I have a few friends that actually work here-unfortunately none of them were my server. And the whole \Big Unit\"""" thing.. I get it.. and it wouldn't have been so bad if someone wasn't ordering one every few minutes! Lol. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went here recently after going to Body Worlds @ the Arizona Science Center. The place itself is really rad, I love the decor and the idea of mixing a sports bar with rock & roll memorabilia. My boyfriend ordered the \""""Tom Brady\"""" burger and I ordered the \""""Sun Devils Clubhouse\"""" sandwich. Our food was pretty good, however our service was not so great. After we finally got our food, our server just never came back to check on us. Although she did walk by a few times, so I really didn't get that. She only stopped by once we were done to drop off the check. That was a big turnoff. \n\nI'd go back, as long as I don't get the disappearing act server again."""""""
4	I ate at the Greene House on a Tuesday night around 7pm. It wasn't busy at all which was nice, actually. Since I was traveling for work, I was dining alone.\n\nMy server (I think her name was Maryann) was excellent. Personable and attentive, she helped me choose a cocktail. I ended up with the Smashed Irishman which was whiskey, lemon juice, mint, honey and a Guinness reduction. It was delicious!\n\nSince it was just me, I chose the Smoked Salmon Bruscetta with a side of mac n' cheese (because I can't help myself). The salmon bruscetta had this amazing horseradish sauce on it and was light and fresh but really satisfying. The mac n' cheese tasted like nothing more than penne with velveeta. Not impressed with that.\n\nOverall, SUPER pleased with the whole experience. Have been thinking about that bruscetta ever since...
2	We tried Florencia because of a Groupon that I purchased - 50% off. The place was empty when we went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We ordered a garden salad to share amongst our table and a specialty pizza.  Overall, I was underwhelmed. They advertise that they sell the dressing for their salad but I found it to be a bit watery.  As for the pizza, parts of the crust were burnt and overall the flavor left something to be desired.  We ordered the Pomodoro, which was listed in the menu as coming with eggplant.  When the pizza arrived I discovered that the eggplant was fried, which I would have liked to know. Since other patrons have raved about the pizza I would give it another chance, but n based on this trip alone I wouldn't give a strong recommendation.
2	I will start this review with saying that The Garcia on 35th Avenue is the only one you should go to.... this location was a huge disappointment...the only reason I give it a 2 star is because the service was good...our server was really nice, we had the tortilla soup, salad, and a grande burrito, I think... Let me start with the burrito...aside of onions and the dried chicken and beef inside, there was nothing to this... I think I make 100% better mexican food than this people, and I'm from Panama--LOL... now the soup, yak... horrible and the salad, had a big peace of lettuce that looked like fungus was growing on it... my little one gagged... I almost complained, but what's the point, we are never going there again... better off going to and Humberto, Roberto, Filiberto...whatever you called those places... believe me you will never be this disappointed.
4	"""My family has been frequenting this little shop for several years as we love the atmosphere.  My husband loves the nutter butter peanut butter parfait, which reminds him of a similar treat he used to get as a kid in New Jersey, and I go for the fresh cut french fries which remind me of the \chips\"""" I used to get at a \""""chip\"""" wagon every summer I would visit  a little town in Canada.  There seems to be alittle something for everyone, with salads, burgers and many desert options...the small town malt shop atmosphere is really something sweet, which might remind you of something you remember as a kid."""""""
4	After a long week, taking the family to dinner Friday nights at Los Olivos is quite the treat for all.  The highlights for us are the relaxing atmosphere, good Mexican food, attentive service, cold Negro Modelo beers and talented mariachis playing music.\n\nMy kids would be happy just eating their awesome chips and salsa.  We all love to get the tortilla soup and share that as a starter.\n\nFor the adults our favorites are the Huevos Rancheros and Chorizo Con Huevos.  The kids love the bean burritos and cheese quesadillas.  \n\nWould have given it a 5 star except last time really did not care for the tough to eat carne asada (way too thin and overcooked) nor the margaritas (way too sour).  If looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that won't break the bank give Los Olivos a try.
3	OK so I am on vacation in AZ and my mom told me she saw this place on the food network and said we had to try it, we are staying in Chandler so I figured hey why not.  The place is pretty cool it fuses Mexican/asian food ( they do have jerk chicken which is considered Jamaican I suppose) anyhow the food was alright it was all pretty basic to me the Jerk chicken was really spicy it definitely needed something... the Terryaki (sp?) chicken was really good but i have tasted it before nothing special ... my sister and mom had the chili reyano over steamed rice they said it was pretty good... I gave it 3 stars because the staff there is freaking awesome the girl who took my order was really helpful because they have you fill out a card and put numbers and letters...it's really weird... but anyways the staff is great and friendly the food is OK nothing special but the price is AMAZING if you are looking for good food for cheap this would be for you because for 5 adults and two children it only came up to $40 and that is really good!!  I probably won't ever go there again but there you have it... 1 1/2 stars for the food .... i wanted to love it but eehh I've definitely had better.
5	Why 5 stars? Well 3 stars just for being open on a Sunday night without a downtown event going on! We walked all over the stadium and arena looking for any signs of life. (I forgot how pathetic downtown is after 5pm). I remembered Seamus and hoped that it would still be open at this late hour of 8:30 in the evening. Sure enough, it was still serving beer. Yippie! And on top of that, the kitchen was still open. I ordered the Sheppard's Pie and it did not disappoint! In fact it was awesome! \n\nThere were still a few patrons in there, a good mix of people, young and old. I think some old ladies complained when I put in some Dropkick Murphys on the juke box. Screw em! The song seemed appropriate. \n\nThe staff was uber cool, too! Our bartender, slash owner, was really cool and talkative. The waitress that would come by to place orders would stop and chat, too. Very friendly staff.\n\nThere's no doubt that this will be my new downtown spot.
4	Gordon Biersch is, like most chains, consistent in quality and service. This is why we keep going back.\n\nI like the fact that they offer their own house brand of beer (and great options) but you can also choose from your favorite American and imported brands, if that's what you want. They have some good options for cocktails, and their prices are what you would expect - a bit high, but not skyrocket.\n\nAgain, food is consistent. My favorite is the Gorgonzola Pear Salad which is great with their hefeweisen. Their burgers are first rate and quite large - my friend and I split one for lunch once and it was the perfect size portion for each of us. We were thrilled that the server was nice enough to plate it for us, even splitting the fries - many places will just bring you one plate as the serving and a smaller plate for sharing (why don't people think?). Although the desserts seem tempting, I've always been too full to sample them.\n\nI've been there when the service was very good, and when it was just OK, but I've never had any major service issues and other than what's noted above, nothing spectacular either. \n\nThe decor is nice and although the ceilings are high the restaurant isn't too loud, surprisingly. They have an outdoor patio and a full bar as well. The mall location is great - we often go there before or after a movie.\n\nOverall it's a good restaurant, and you know what to expect - you aren't likely to be surprised one way or the other. It's a great place to go with a group of people too, and they will likely be what you remember about the dinner, rather than the food, service or atmosphere. Isn't that really how it should be?
4	nextDOOR- something just kept drawing us back to this bar throughout our First Friday crawl.  Our night pretty much went like this: browse the vendors, back for a cocktail, check out some galleries, back for a cocktail, check out the band and finally back for a cocktail and stick. \n\nI am so excited to see a bar like nextDOOR in the downtown are.  The setup was very cool with a giant palm tree like bar made out of rebar.  There was plenty of seating, but only outdoors.  The inside of the building looked like an abandoned house.  But you always have the restaurant Fate next door is you want to sit inside; I imagine this place will slow down in the hot summer months.  \n\nGood mixed drinks, good music - live dj and cool crowd. The service was typical of a crowded bar - 10 minutes or longer for a cocktail.  I especially enjoyed the red mandarine (splg?).  I'll be back for sure and not only for First Friday.
1	I got a recommendation from a friend to eat here.  He loved it.  I did not.  \n\nI went here with my husband and a friend who was visiting from out of town.  We made a reservation and good thing because they were so busy.  The interior decor was charming and the bathrooms were fun.  It was a nice spring day so we sat outside.  And that's when it went downhill.\n\nOur server took forever.  We asked for chips and salsa several times and never got it.  The busboy kept bringing chips to the tables around us but never to us.  Finally, the chips finally arrived -- a few minutes before our food did!  The food was not good.  We each ordered something different and none of us liked what we ordered.  We tried switching dishes hoping we would like something the other person ordered but no such luck.  The only thing we did like was the sangria.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Save your money and go to a real Mexican restaurant.
3	"""I want the Garage to do well. It is still a work in progress, though. Three of us visited two weeks ago. We were sat right next to a group of 40 - 55 year old ladies out for a surprise birthday. What's with that anyways. Do you really need to go to a somewhat small restaurant with your pack of \girls,\"""" and occupy a large swath of the dining area? Do you need all the paraphernalia (collages, centerpieces, hats)? I was seriously waiting to see a youngish birthday girl. Nope, she was the oldest. 60, easy. Act your age. While you're at it, you are not a size six anymore. Needless to say, it was loud. At least one of the revelers apologized right when we sat. As if that's any conciliation for the volume 11 cackling. \n\nFirst off, the Garage has good brewskis. Not a huge supply, but what they have is quality. We had wings and truffle oil deviled eggs. Both were great. I had Schriner's Sausage Flat bread, and it was great. Wife had something, I forget, and said it was good. Friend had some large salad and said it was good, too. Overall, food was better than most. \n\nSo, why the three stars you ask? Service. Why do some cool places slip up on this? Is it because they hire \""""cool people\"""" or friends that don't really want to work? First off, a server (we were seated at the entrance/ exit to the kitchen) dropped a glass bottle of ketchup five feet from my foot. My wife and I had splatter on our jeans and glass near our sandal clad feet. Hardly a response. We were handed a rag. Our server not so sympathetically wondered, \""""Oh, they almost dropped a bottle of ketchup on you.\"""" The rest of the night just seemed a little disorganized and not relaxing? Every server seemed in the weeds or confused. Empty beer and water glasses. Entrees arrived and empty app plates sat there. \n\n$60 for three for apps, dinner and beers."""""""
5	"""I am not a big sub sandwich eater.  I've tried many of them - Subway, Quizno's, Jason's Deli, Eegee's......etc.   Besides Eegee's (which is really good), I just thought they were all decent sandwiches - some better than others.  But I have had Jersey Mike's a handful of times now, and their sandwiches are much better than the others.  Just get it \Mike's Way\"""" and enjoy the tasty food you receive.\n\nBut just as importantly, the customer service I have received at this store has been impeccable.  The people are always very friendly and patient and that makes a huge difference to me.  \n\nI must say that their sandwiches are a little pricier than others.  I get their \""""Giant\"""" size (ok - so I'm a big eater....) at it runs about 12 bucks...yikes!   But as delicious as it is, it's worth it.\n\nTry it - you won't be sorry..."""""""
4	I'm on the bandwagon - the Loveland bandwagon, that is...\n\nI'd read the reviews for this boutique since Paul B's FTR when they first opened back in July... and I finally made it in for a visit yesterday during my local holiday shopping!\n\nI met Althea, one of the owners, and she was super sweet... and has fantastic taste in clothing and accessories.  Everything in the store is adorable and IMHO reasonably priced.  I purchased a really cute ring and a t-shirt with a boston terrier on it (for my mom).  I showed off both of these purchases on Channel 12's local shopping segment early this morning!\n\nLoveland carries mostly women's clothing and accessories but also some cute stuff for kids and dogs... they are just starting to carry some men's t-shirts too.  The selection is fairly limited but really unique.  I highly suggest checking out Loveland for your holiday shopping (they are having a big sale starting this Friday) and beyond.  I'm sure I'll be back despite the fact that it's a bit of a drive... it is worth it!
4	I have only been for happy hour, but it is a five star fare! \n\nMy high status man candy and I had several margaritas over chips and salsa all for under $20. \n\nThe Casa Margarita is a little sweet, but very good once the ice melts a little bit. I was slightly disappointed that they didn't offer a blended option, but I was happy enough with on the rocks.\n\nThe chips were light and crunchy and came with three different salsas. I liked the brownish green stuff the best (sorry, the real name escapes me).\nThe tomato based salsa looks and tastes like marinara sauce and the pico is way too chunky. \n\nThe decor is adorable! I loved everything from the Ikea lighting fixtures to the over-sized Dia de los Muertos skulls. I also liked the half the bar was inside and half was out because it really opened up the area. \n\nI can't wait to go back for more!
4	As a newbie to the Gluten-free lifestyle and one who loves to dine out, I was really excited to find Picazzos. First off, their menu is filled with all of my favorite Italian specialties, with about 90% of them gluten-free. We took the whole family for a Sunday lunch. I had the Spaghetti/Chicken Picatta lunch special with a ceaser side salad, all GF. The pasta was light and flavorful with big pieces of white meat chicken and tons of yummy capers. The salad was just ok. I'm kind of a ceaser snob so that actually why they only got 4 stars. My husband had a pear and Gorgonzola salad along with a slice of pepperoni pizza. The vinaigrette on the salad was really good and he said the pizza crust was excellent. His meal was not GF. The kids split GF spaghetti and meatballs and a cheese pizza. They both devoured the pizza and meatball, but the spaghetti was a little tougher to sell. The pasta is Quinoa which has a different texture than regular spaghetti. But the flavor was still great with the sauce on it. We didn't stay for desert but looked at the menu and every selection is GF. We will definitely return to try some of the more GF options. For all of you hungry Celiac's out there, Picazzos does it right!
5	My work got some Christmas allowance and instead of doing a dinner we decided to get a really nice lunch for our branch. We decided on Oregano's cause it was on the way. \n\nI had the stuffed Italian sandwich and it blew my mind. I couldn't believe how bug this sandwich was, it provided me with two wonderful lunches. \n\nIt looks like some of my coworkers got the sausage sandwich and the steak sandwich and one person got a pasta dish and couldn't even eat a quarter of it because they gave so much. \n\nAfter that experience I am going to make more of an effort to get to the restaurant instead of getting it to go.
5	BEST WORKOUT EVER!\n\nI consider my self in somewhat decent shape, I do 4-6 days of cardio 40+ mins but this class kicked my ass! It's all body work and we used 1-2 lbs weights and my arms killed. I've never had my body shake so much from working so hard.\n\nI was hurting but the good deep work out burn for 2 days after my first workout. I cannot wait to join and do this as an alternative to my current workout. It has been the best workout I've done in a long while.\n\nthe people were friendly, the hour went by super fast, nobody was rude, they were helpful, I was probably one of the younger girls there but there were older ladies, which gave me a boost. Its tough so its not for the weak!! great music to workout to as well.\n\nI bought there 100$ new client unlimited, which is a great deal already because it pays for it self in benefits and after 5 classes!! I totally cannot wait to be there almost everyday!!
4	"""I was looking for a good diner, went to trusty Yelp, found Harlow's, sorted by Elite...Mark D's review had me at \bad girl.\"""" \n\nLooks like Harlow's could be a good impromptu UYE lunch spot or hangover recovery HQ. \n\nI had the basic eggs scrambled with cheese, home fries with onions, wheat toast. My diner standard fare. Good stuff, just what you're looking for when you need the diner grub. \n\nHarlow's is pricier than diners I'm accustomed to. $7 is a little steep for what I had. But it was perfectly diner-done and in front of me in under 5 minutes. When I lived in Cleveland's west side there was a large diner density so to stay competitive they always had specials for under $5 bucks."""""""
5	We visited Olive & Ivy while we were on vacation for a long weekend in Scottsdale, and it was hands down the best meal we had.  We were seated promptly when we arrived (we had a reservation) and our server was awesome- knowledgeable, informative and not overbearing.  The ambiance was great, sort of trendy/modern.  The space is large and the tables are spaced nicely, making it a nice date night spot.  The food was really great.  We had the hummus for an appetizer, which was amazing and had just the right amount of garlic.  For entrees I had the scallopes and he had the bacon wrapped pork tenderlion, both of which were supurb.  Dinner was a little pricey, but for the great quality of food and service I'd say that it was worth it.  If we visit Scottsdale again we will definitely return to Olive & Ivy.
4	Me and the family go here at least every 2 weeks to get some of their delicious Gyros, they have a gyro special every day and for the price you get plenty of food. very good service also, the decor is a little weird because this location used to be a 5 and diner, also if it's slow time of day it's really quiet in the place no music in the background so it feels kinda strange. but damn I love their gyros.
4	went over of my my way to visit based on a suggestion from my little bro.\n\n\nThe scene- walking in it looked very friendly and clean a little stark bu nice and modern. The music didnt make any sense in the place . weird, felt like it didnt belong.\n\nFlovors- ok so yes they did have several flavors but was disappointed that there went really too many that i thought would mix well. although they have aoatmeal cookie that was dead on to the real thing ,I wasnt too impressed by the flavors which, didnt have anything unique.\n\nTop of the morning'- the toppings were quite spectacular , mainly the sauces, frosting,mallow cream, nutella, all kinds of yummy toppings and my bestest Nochi, i think thats it( little powdery mallows)\n\nCounter Lady- was helpful and nice, the oly thing she was explaining the way it works to a group in friont, but she controls the samples so we had to wait a bit and the people behind us even longer. I must say while there wasnt custmers she was cleaning and arranging the toppings so it was very nice to see staff working, not just texdting behind the corner, looked like she had pride in her job.\n\nBreak it down Jess- I will return to Yogurtology if in the area and in the mood, however having drove 10 miles just to try it, I wasnt super impressed but if you like the self servestyle, its a go!
3	You know what I like best about this place?\n\nI love going to places where I am the youngest customer by a considerable margin.\n\nAnd I'm old enough to have spent the first half of my years so far using phones that were attached to walls and stuff. You know, the ones where you had to turn this twisty thing to make a call and you didn't know who was calling you before you answered?\n\nAnyway, the older generation seems to like good deals on veggies and other produce, because they usually have them here. Sometimes you can get in and out without being overcome by the feeling that the zombie apocalypse is upon us, and they are all on walkers.\n\nIn more-or-less typical Basha's practice, some of the items are weirdly overpriced. Stick with the loss-leaders and you might make out ok.\n\nOh, and also: The parking spaces are nice and wide. Wide enough to fully swing open the door of your Buick Park Avenue.
2	Chef Sara works hard.  She is a bit over bearing and preachy about how 'bad' all other food other than hers is.  My husband, vegetarian, loves her food.  For me, seemed WAY pricey for what it was.  Many things on the menu were not available and there really isn't anything 'conventional'.   Mushroom 'quiche' was like a mushroom puree/pudding poured in pie pan... it was raw, wierd and not really tasty.  The salad was fine, but super expensive for a bowl full of greens and nuts.   I'm surprised this place has survived.  If I want an expensive lunch, I'll go to Cafe Bink.  Plus they don't try to 'educate' you about food while you are trying to eat.  I think you have to be a particular type of diner to enjoy this cafe.
1	"""So we hobbled over here in our high heels (car hunting wasn't on the days agenda) from Ferrari to find some Cayenne's they had advertised on-line.  At least the salesman got up out of his chair but had no clue where any of the cars were.  I've never heard \aint\"""" \""""wanna\"""" and \""""dunno\"""" so many times in one conversation, let alone from a Lotus salesman.  On the upside, they sell Fisker's here too.  Come in for a little eye candy."""""""
5	"""Cutie! Great owner, great owner's daughter, great owner's dog, great vibe! I am still new here so in my \hey let's turn down this block\"""" exploring I happened to see the sign from the street, recalled reading good things about it on yelp, and just had to stop in. \n\nI have been on a mission to discover the right little local something to send back to a friend in NYC. I found the perfect little sea blue recycled glass ring! Chatted for a long while with Jinia, one of the owners, had some great laughs, enjoyed all the cute local artist-made accessories, was inspired to get my craft back on, and really could've hung out allllll day. \n\nIt's really a cute shop to stop into for that perfect gift. And I love how Jinia promoted the other businesses in the plaza---two of which I visited, spent money in, and happily shared how I heard about them."""""""
4	This is some artery clogging bowel busting goodness.\nThe big, juicy Amber Rose-esque torta del rey will make Yeezy jealous.  Meat, meat, and meat stacked up high.\nPaired with a cantaloupe aqua de fresca and you have a winner.\n\nI'd only hoped that the chorizo was cooked a little more to a crisp, but with all that stuff piled on it's hard to notice.  Also, it's a mexican joint, no?  How about some tortilla chips instead of ruffles, or am I missing something?  That's like eating my pho w/ spaghetti.\n\nBut it's cheap and service is good and worth a stop just to experience the Man v Food tour.
5	I spilled a large cup of coffee on my MacBook Pro 6 months ago (luckily no cream or sugar). Did all the recommended steps to prevent as much damage as possible, and thankfully everything works except for the keyboard.\n\nAfter 6 months of using a separate bluetooth keyboard on top of my dead laptop keyboard, I decide to take it into Apple Store Biltmore. After explaining what happened, the Genius tells me I've voided my warranty and it will cost $1,240 to fix the machine - without even opening it up. This evidently is the cost of a new bottom case, logic board, etc. Even after running diagnostics and showing that everything is working fine, Apple has a policy that it either replaces everything or nothing. That wasn't going to work for me.\n\nSo I call Orchard, explain the situation and Justin tells me they see this a lot. Since everything else seemed to work fine, he was able to order the keyboard only, as a used part harvested from a similar MBP, for $70. A few days later I bring it in, and Cameron was able to install the keyboard inside of two hours. He also took photos of areas where corrosion had occurred, and explained how he cleaned them with rubbing alcohol.\n\nNow my $3,000 MacBook Pro is back to perfect condition, and it only cost me $160. Thanks, Orchard, for saving me $1,080!\n\nThis isn't my first time dealing with them and each experience has been positive. I've been a Mac user since the late 1980s, and I've never felt more comfortable working with another Apple specialist, as I do with The Orchard.
4	This second location is closer to us then the Thomas Rd location so bonus star for that.\n\nThe food seemed consistent with the other location, portions, spiciness, flavor, everything seems to be a duplicate which is a good thing. I usually get some sort of tofu and basil dish or tofu and eggplant and it's always great. Hot is Hot (as it should be).\n\nNot sure I love the atmosphere inside but there is nothing wrong with it, for some reason I don't like the tail ceilings here even though normally I would see it as an improvement to the space....oh well.\n\nThe portions at Tottie's are large....does anyone else think this? I always have a to-go container which is fine with me.\n\nSometimes Asian fusion goes wrong but I can't see anything wrong with how Tottie executes their dishes.
4	I'll keep this sweet and to the point, realistically, i'd give this place a 3.5\n\nPros:\n*willing to accommodate food allergens- I've vegan, and super lactose intolerant.\n*beautifully decorated restaurant, well plated food.\n*the food is made to order, even the sauces.\n*I liked some of the inventive touches in their food- my curry with peas, pumpkin, baby corn.\n*one of our companions asked for extra sauce and they very kindly made more\n\nCons:\n*Portions are ridiculously small for the price.  Everyone at our table of 9 ordered a separate entree, and no own was full, even the ones who got appetizers.\n*My throat was killing me, so I asked for some warm water, instead of iced, while I looked over the menu- they brought back water that was colder than room temp, without the ice and I was politely informed that this is what they had.  But I wonder how in the world they serve hot tea on the menu, if they don't have hot water in the kitchen.  \n*Some of the veggies in my curry were undercooked (think aldente potato)\n\nAll in all the flavor of the food was good, but 1 cup of rice and 1.5 cups of curry does not a 18 dollar entree make. You really are paying for the ambience and customer service.\n\nIf i had a special occasion, i'd prolly visit here again, but when i'm needing a thai-fix, there are other places around town that have equally great food, without the upcharge.
4	Hipster hangout you can drag the kids along and not feel bad about it.\n\nThe place is setup like a house and the first time you go it is for sure confusing.  Do I sit down or go to the counter or bar or what.. Its kind of a free for all.  I have been a few times and still feel a little awkward when I walk in.  The hot chocolate is great and the egg sandwich tasty.  The mac and cheese for evening is also really good.  \nThe service is ok, but not overly helpful or friendly.\nThe place is dripping with kids too cool for school, businessmen, and families... so a great spot to hit up if you are in downtown phx
1	"""Purchased two pairs of glasses for my son and picked them up today.  I would never pay their prices if they weren't on sale.  They are 2 - 3 times as expensive as other places.  \n\nBy biggest issue is their terrible lack of service.  When I picked out the glasses and paid it took over 20 minutes to be helped.  I asked if they were just busy today and their employee said, \No.  It is actually a little slow.\""""  I couldn't believe it since there several of us waiting to be helped.  \n\nTonight was no different.  It took 20 minutes of standing in line to simply pick up the glasses.  Like last time, there were only two employees working.  I won't be coming back."""""""
4	Came here with a group of friends. It's my second conveyor belt driven sushi place I've been too and I like it! Their were some rolls I never had before and they are suprisingly affordable, like really afforable! They also have $4 Asahi beers! Now I'm in! The service here is pretty chill, and they all look great! They also place music that I like here, I don't know how many times I wanted to just fist pump while enjoying my drink and sushi!
4	Moving is especially scary when you have a Dr. that you really like and trust.  I found Dr. Cohen and am so happy to have a new Dr. in my new town that is so caring for her patients.  I went to see her for an overall checkup and was really impressed with how thorough she was.  She asked a lot of question and and really took the time to get to know me and my history.  She said to call if I ever need anything and I left healthy and happy.  Thanks Doc!
1	It's a company policy that you can order your burgers still medium-rare (or even rare) at any In-N-Out location, but despite being paid more than minimum wage at this location, they refuse to put in more than minimum effort and lie that they only cook their burgers to one temperature (which also isn't true, as I've received random temperature burgers here when not specifying any specific doneness). Lazy employees who are creating bad examples of what should be relatively higher-tier fast-food burgers.\n\nIf you really want In-N-Out, go to another location. Unlike basically every other restaurant, the people here just don't give a damn.
5	This place is excellent!  Here is my run down:\n\n* Hot Goat Cheese and Wild Mushroom Arugula Salad - I split this with my wife.  While it was very good, I wouldn't recommend splitting it because it wasn't that big.  I'm really not a big fan of frou- frou salads either so next time I'd like to try the wedge or Caesar.\n\n* Seared Pacific Ahi Steak with Saut\u00e9ed Shiitake Mushrooms and Wasabi Potato Puree, GingerSoy Jus - OMG!  This was an awesome dish.  Nice big ahi steak cooked perfectly along with those wasabi potatoes.  Holy cow sooooo good!  Awesome combination and oh so yummy.\n\n*Crab Fried Rice with Scallions and Mushrooms = Awesome\n\n* Crisp Parmesan and Truffle French Fries = Wow\n\n* Truffled Macaroni & Cheese = I didn't get this but it sounds great and I'm definitely gonna try it next time\n\n* Saut\u00e9ed Spinach with Garlic and Shallots - eh...I guess it was ok for spinach.\n\nAnyway, I can't wait to go back.  The ambiance is excellent and so is the service.  The prices are pretty much in line with what you would expect for a trendy seafood place in the area.  Next time I go I'd like to check out their happy hour which is supposed to be very good.
4	Dined here again and tried the jalapeno hummus with pita chips, and had the mozzarella, avocado, tomato salad.  The jalapeno hummus was excellent, and had just the right amount of spiciness to contrast with the creamy texture of the hummus.  The pita chips were nice and crispy.  I had the small order of salad, which was beautifully prepared, with large portions.  It tasted great, and each component meshed well with each other.  One of my friends ordered the chicken fantasia which was a huge portion of chicken with sauce, veggies, and rice.  Service was very friendly and drinks were refilled promptly as needed.  I like that the food here is healthier, and has an emphasis on more sustainable, local ingredients (Such as the coffee and desserts) and high quality proteins (Such as grass-fed beef, and free-range chicken).  Definitely a good place to frequent for vegetarians or omnivores!
3	3.5 stars! I must say, I'm a total fan of their Zipps Golden Wings! Gotta love their reverse happy hour! Ordering their wings on medium is smart move, their wings are already so flavorful and sweet, that its a shame to go any hotter, since you'll mask the inherent, crisp, and juicy flavor. I'd say pass on the Fish Tacos, and if you're in a burger move, order the Jalapeno Burger. Sampled their beer, not bad! \n\nBreakdown:\nZipps Golden Wings ~ a MUST get!\nFish Tacos ~ Yawn...\nSweet Potato Chips ~ Could do again!\nJalapeno Burger ~ Delish! \n\nOverall, this is a chill spot with your better than average bar food!
3	Called in my order and had a coupon in College Times for $9.99 large one-topping and 1 liter of soda. The pizza was decent, not in top 10 though, but was foldable and was worth the money. It did better when it was reheated also. Also added a large salad with Italian dressing which was probably made in the morning, but everything was still fresh (a few cukes, tomatoes and lettuce). Slice of Sicily better, but with coupon, this pie is worthy if your in the area.
3	Ordered to-go tonight.  I asked the guy if he could mix the suicide sauce and honey garlic sauce for me for the wings. He said that he could not do that.  I find this odd having worked at a restaurant before and this is something that is completely doable.  Furthermore, I have been to other native NY'ers and this was never a problem.  Basically, it just comes down to not really caring about pleasing the customer.  \n\nWhen I showed up, I got the impression that the place was disorganized.  I remember asking to get BC instead of ranch, so he walked back into the kitchen to get me that, but came out empty handed.  Then a minute later some other guy comes out with it.  Whatever system they have to keep the orders straight and what needs to come out next for their separate take out window seems to lack.
3	Big  Thank you to Honey Bears to start off, why you ask ? Because they were open ! Wish I could give a 1/2 star extra for that.  Listen Downtown!  you   want me  to bring my family and friends down on the weekend,you want us to explore downtown and use the metro rail,   we need some family friendly , hopefully locally owned,  places to eat !  So 1 big ole star for that!  Now for the rest ...Honey Bears has that  hole in the wall , down south feel to me , and that alone will probably bring me back at sometime .  Especially if I have kids with me otherwise it's Switch, Matt's or Fez. \n\nOkay and now for the hits:\n\nThis is a  good  place for pulled pork or BBQ chicken sandwich ...don't stray from that and you will be happy , husband and kiddos gave a big two thumbs up for that... lil mini me had a 1/2 chicken dinner  w/o \nBBQ sauce ( weirdo)  and pronounced it good.  Mine were  ribs which were very small, not meaty and I had trouble with tang of the vinegar based sauce.(BTW hubby loved it ) Portions were big on everything but my ribs.  Faux Daughter number 2 couldn't finish her sandwich. \n\nI could eat a big ole plate of the mac and cheese wow cheesey goodness... kids agreed.\nFries were rumored to be good , one of my kids said  better than\n in -n-out the others shot her a dirty look .. so you try them and see. \nLoved the coleslaw and I wouldn't  share it with anyone .Corn was good but not memorable. \n\nThey have RC and Seven up products which goes to show it's old school I guess. If you can't abide by that bring your own I guess. \n\nService was great, the dude taking our order was personable, helpful and patient with our big order. They also redid mini me's order when it first came with BBQ sauce. \n\nPlace is nicer than Stacey's for ambiance but I don't really look for that with BBQ , do you?
4	OMG! I can't believe they opened a JJ's in Tempe!! I was so thrilled to see it while driving on Mill. This place used to be my fav spot when I was in Charleston, IL for high school.\n\nSo I had to stop to just get the taste of home that I missed for so long (since 2005), and decided to order my usual, the Turkey Tom. The sandwich was simple, bread was soft, and ingredients were fresh!!! I just felt healthier than eating burger and fries. (btw, the Pepe is really good too!)\n\nWill definitely keep going back :)
5	One of my favorite places to go to for kid's birthday parties. Why, you ask? Because the party itself is DOWNSTAIRS and away from the jangling machines and sugar crazed munchkins. You do the cake, presents, food the kids scramble up the stairs or elevator- and you can either enjoy the semi-quiet of the party area or go upstairs to play and watch the munchkins. Now that mine are older- I am LOVING the option to OPT OUT of the gaming area.
3	We really wanted to like Honey Bears. As far as BBQ goes, this was a perfectly average meal. My side salad was ok, corn was very good, pulled chicken was very dry and the roll it was on (got sliders) was store bought. No amount of sauce made the chicken juicier. Unfortunately the sauce had no character-was just sauce. While we are on that, flies were all around the sauce. My husbands ribs were ok but not very meaty. We are hitting all the BBQ joints in the area as we just moved here. We won't be going back here unfortunately.
4	It was our first time here so we had to have the defaults to judge the quality.  Everything was well prepared and spiced well.  You can actually taste the flavor of the spices and the heat doesn't kick in till you stop eating.  Any other restaurant we can normally eat super spicey, but we went conservative of 4 out of 10 and that was perfect.  The food is hearty stick to your ribs.  Two dishes, a rice and two naans was enough food for three plus enough leftover for a fourth diner.  So even though the prices are a bite high, it works out in the end.\n\nMango Lassi - creamy and refreshing, not too sweet\nChicken Masala - sauce was a little thick but well spiced\nMalai Kofta - sauce was a better consistency but was not a fan of the homemade cheese balls\nPeas Pulaou - ok\nPlain and Garlic Naan - both good but the garlic one kicks it up a notch.
5	mmmmmmm\n\nFood:  Pizza, cheese sticks, garlic knots, chicken parm... it is all so very, very tasty.  I purposely order too much so that I can enjoy the leftovers the next day.\n\nService:  The service is good.  Sometimes they get a bit busy and the server doesn't come by for a while.  Since the restuarant is very open you can see that it is because they are working with other customers and not off goofing.  Usually someone else will come by and see if you need anything when the wait staff gets over-occupied.\n\nConvenience:  This location is in a shopping area with tons of ample parking so it makes it very easy to get in and out of without hassle.
5	I mean srsly... who doesn't love a communal wash area?!\n\nLiberty Market is easily not only my favorite East Valley Eatery, but just plain hang out spot. The wifi, quality coffee, smiling employees and friendly service are only a fraction of what makes this place awesome. It's attention to detail, delicious eats and creative vibe are second to none. I deeply appreciate how involved they are in the community, and the owner Joe is always a tweet or email away and always has a smile and something nice to say.\n\nI look back fondly on my unemployed summer of '09 as much of it was spent drinking soy lattes at the E61 bar and chatting it up with friends over salads and desert at Liberty Market. \n\nJoe, keep up the good work!
4	"""Had lunch here on a weekend when we didn't want to wait for a table at Morning Glory.  This is definitely \slow\"""" food so be warned.  Luckily the outdoor seating was beautiful but a bread basket definitely would've helped calm our rumbling stomachs.\n\nFarm burger ($14) was one of the best burgers I've had in the Valley - flavorful beef patty with a moist tender interior.  Braised short rib sandwich was a bit bland by comparison.  Locally grown garden veg crudite ($14) was fresh and full of crunchy healthy goodness."""""""
3	"""Ok, Stingray has it's high points. It's trendy, hip, and might just explode with young, beautiful people. The atmosphere and decor are nice, but that doesn't completely make up for the fact that the sushi simply falls around the mean. It's average. The menu has a nice selection of rolls and other dishes, and they're good, just not...great. We had a couple different specialty rolls, a tofu dish, soft shell crab, and tempura. Overall it was fresh and well-presented and halfway between actually authentic Japanese and some American Asian fusion food. The bar is crowded if you grab drinks while waiting and the bartenders weren't really fabulous in any way. Same goes for the servers who lack attentiveness and decorum in general. For a place with such a wait, huge crowds, and pretentious hostesses, I'd expect a little more. The curved booths along the sides are nice, though. Oh and, beware, in regards to the well-earned and deserved \scene\"""": you might just see/run into every person you want (and don't want) to on a Saturday night."""""""
5	Most of my friends know, this place is my Cheers! \n\nThe staff has always been wonderful - once they chatted it up with my mother about Irish music, that was years ago and she still talks about it. It does not take long for the staff to remember your name and introduce themselves to your guests - everyone is your friend at Rosie's! \n\nThe food is also great - I really like the Sheppard's Pie!\n\nPS, they have Wi-Fi. A happy hour beer while finishing up some work - nothing could be better!
4	Don't blink because you might miss this little hole in the wall while driving by and also don't judge it by its look. I have been coming here for quite a while. The food is good and the prices are even better. If you're looking for fast cheap Chinese that is much better than Panda express this is the place to go. I highly recommend the vegetable lo mein and the orange chicken. Great spring rolls too! Overall a great little spot!
4	Retail Lab is way too hipster for the Biltmore Fashion Park.  Location aside, this store is fab.  The streets of NYC are littered with Orla Kiely bags and Retail Lab must have the biggest collection of Orla Kiely stateside.  I didn't even know she made clothes because I've only seen her bags in every boutique in Brooklyn.  Retail Lab was having a 25% off sale on every item in the store so my friend bought a bag and wallet.  Retail Lab used to stock Lotta Jansdotter and other brands they have are Paul Frank, Penguin, and Modern Amusement.\n\nWe met the owner while we were shopping.  He was terrific.  Really knows and loves the products he sells.
2	It's kitchy overpriced breakfast spot.  Limited menu, bad service and small portions.  Mom wanted to take us there as something special for Sunday morning. \n\nWe ate and thankfully weren't riding together, so we stopped about 3 miles down the road to get something else to eat as we were still hungry.  \n\nStaff couldn't keep the coffee carafes full.  Patrons brought their dogs, who didn't like the other dogs so our breakfast time was spent with a ton of barking back and forth. \n\nSelf serve beverage is great, if it's free - which it is not and for the prices, should be. \n\nThe facilities were upgraded port-o-potties.  At least there was running water and electricity, right.\n\nThis place could be so much better. \n\nOh and PS - staff needs to make a sweep of the grounds/dining area. Huge dead and squashed bugs (yes plural) on the patio blocks in not appetizing and probably bad for all the dogs that visit too.
4	After working down the street from Freddy's for a year and half and wanting to go, I finally went with a coworker who raved about the place.\n\nI ordered the # 1 combo, burger, drink and fries. The meal was just under $7.\n\nThe burger is fresh and very good and enjoyed my burger. I wouldn't say it's my favorite burger, but it's in the upper echelon especially in the Phoenix Area.. \n\nOne thing that stands out is the pickles that are served on the burger. I've never had  long sliced pickles on a burger, usually just pickle chips. I wish ketchup came on the burger, but you can add this yourself.\n\nFries were good, could have used a little more than the small scoop I received. \n \nI will definitely go back and maybe next time opt for a custard or sweet treat.
3	I have to say I was slightly surprised when I went to the State Fair this year. Now I wouldn't go as far as saying I was impressed and it's a must for families or friends. My sister and I won free tickets to the fair and reserved seats for The Band Perry Concert off the radio and thought that was a good enough excuse to head that way. We got their around 5:30pm and it was relatively easy to find a somewhat secure parking spot (for $10). \n\nWe went on a Wednesday so I imagine it wasn't as crowded as a weekend tournament, but this day happened to be a day where you could get in free if you bought three canned food items to donate to St. Mary's Food Bank. Good way to save on admission. I think I would be a little irked if I had to pay $10.00 to get in on top of cost for game/ride tickets and food and everything else. The other nice thing about going on a Wednesday is most of the games and rides are half the # of tickets or 4 tickets per game/ride (not all of them but the majority). \n\nLines were short and you didn't have to wait much for anything. They sell some pretty strange fair food - I mean I can't even imagine eating fried butter, but I did have a fried Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was pretty good. \n\nWe went around 7:00 into the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum and it was easy to enter and pretty full once we got inside. We got moved to seats closer than our original section. This is a one time adventure for me and I am glad we went but the fact that it was pretty much free is what made it appealing.
5	"""This place is a hidden gem for sure!  My husband and I have tried a few places for Greek food and all of it has been mediocre until we found this spot. I came across Chicago Gyros on Yelp and I am beyond pleased with this find.  I've now gone on 3 occasions and they haven't failed in the consistency of their food and service.  The best Gyros and tzatziki sauce by far that we've found in Phoenix.  The portions are more than generous!  The basmati rice is excellent if you order one of their plates.  This place is definitely one of our new favorite regular spot in our takeout rotation!  \n\nI recommended that our friends try their other location (since it was closer to where they work) and they were all as pleased as we were.  I don't normally write reviews online, but I think this place deserved a plug because of it's \not so obvious\"""" location."""""""
2	I've never been to New Mexico but now I don't want to go. \n\nThe place is cute,though. Nobody was in there on a Saturday. Get there early as they close at 5:00pm. Odd for a restaurant. \nWe made personal friends with the server who was delightful.  Since there was nobody there for him to wait on we talked to him a lot.\n\nI'm just not a fan of this kind of cooking. The chips were different but good. Salsa was ketchupy. The beans were bland but probably healthy. My carnitas burrito was filled with a strange kind of pork that was full of little chunks of grizzle. Like it was carved from a waste part of the pig like the head or hocks. HUGE turn-off for me. When I have to stop chewing and spit something in my napkin every other bite you loose me. I expected nice pulled pork. I should have gotten the chicken one like my wife. She loved hers. The taste was good, however. It was kind of hot from all the hatch chilis. You may want to ask for sour cream. The rice was OK. \n\nYou get a huge portion. You will get 2 meals from it so the cost is great. I might go back and try something else from the menu but I like Macayos better.
2	I like Paradise Bakery, but if you have been to multiple locations or ever the same location multiple times, you know it can be hit or miss depending on who is making the salad. This was the first time that the same person made salads and they were drastically different.  I met someone here for an early dinner/first date and spent time talking and getting to know each other. The restaurant was not busy and provided a good setting for a meeting. After about an hour, we made our way to the line and ordered salad. \n\nThe soup maven had to go in the back and fetch the salad lady. My date ordered Greek salad with no onions and no olives, but add chicken. The lady struggled with the successful completion of this challenging  order. She started to add onions until my friend stopped her - then she started to add the olives, again being foiled. She neglected to add the chicken until reminded. My friend's bowl was about half full when completed. She made her way down the line when the salad lady asked for my order. I stuck with an Asian chicken salad (no substitutions or alterations), but then she discovered no tongs - so into the back she went and emerged three minutes later. When completed, I had a heaping bowl of salad. \n\nBy this time my date already hit the register, paid for her own salad, picked up the drink and sat down to begin eating. Normally I would have paid for both meals, but the salad delay thwarted my chivalrous attempt... My check out was uneventful and I joined her at the table.\n\nAnother issue with the restaurant was the temperature. I can appreciate that this is Arizona and you need AC, but it isn't that hot out now. The temperature must have been set for the dog days of August in the Deep South. It was chilly and she was noticeable cold and shaking. That made for uncomfortable eating and conversation (I am sure it wasn't my company). She finished most of the salad and I maybe hit half before deciding to leave and head for warmer ground. \n\nI know it is a small treat, but the signature item at Paradise Bakery is the chocolate chip cookie. It is a bakery after all. Try the 2 for 1 cookie, stuff your face with a few bites of each free sample or take home a dozen. They are definitely worth it and provide an excellent happy finish to an otherwise healthy meal.\n\nA little more consistency on the salad portions, some fine tuning of the timeliness with the salad preparations and a reasonable temperature would have made the evening more enjoyable.
5	"""I walk in here with the intentions of getting an egg salad sandwich, when the three people in front of me order a \straw\"""" sandwich.. basically pastrami, sauerkraut, melted cheese and bread.\n\nDamn that sounds good!!\n\nSo i end up getting the same thing with a side of fresh fries and a pickle.\n\nThese sandwiches are big enough to share with someone, but with me starving like I was, I quickly polished off the entire thing.  it was yum.\n\nI used to go to the one that was at Christown, but it's been closed for many years.  I was happy when they opened up this location.  It's right next to work, so that helps.\n\nI will be back!"""""""
5	Great Mexican street food! Well ok I should say great burritos because to date that is all we have had here, they are addictive.\nI order the shrimp burrito with no beans and I ask for cabbage, they are freaking incredible, the shrimp burritos are more expensive at $8 but are worth every penny.  My husband orders the beef burrito with no beans.\nNo there is no rice, sour cream or cheese in these burritos, if you want that go to your local crappy chain Tex Mex fast food joint.\n\nMy husband speaks Spanish, but I'm sure you are fine ordering in english.
3	Blooze is your standard dark ass bar. And it's mainly for bikers, so if you tried to wear a collared shirt in there, my guess is you'd probably be jumped.  \n\nThey have live music sometimes and the drinks are really cheap. And I think it's owed to their $2.50 well drinks served every day up to 6pm that Blooze is always raging during the day. They also have $1.25 beers every single day, all day long.  \n\nThis bar is trouble.  The drinks are so cheap that you end up drinking way more than you planned and then you find yourself dancing, flanked in between two biker dudes wearing bandanas.  Be careful.
5	A cute, cozy spot, with perfectly attentive service and fabulous and inexpensive food. A Sunday morning mimosa pitcher was a delicious accompaniment to breakfast sandwiches and the most amazing sandwich I've had in a long time: a BLT with tempura shrimp and avocado aioli. First of all, the shrimp were jumbo-sized. And the whole thing put together was really interesting and good! The bacon was both thick and crispy. Can't wait to come back and try more things from the menu!
5	To Hell with Hooters and Half Moon! They ain't got sh*t on the Kilt.  Whoops the Ni99a came out for a min.  Get back in there, they're not ready. lol The Kilt has decent plasmas, and lots of room (except for UFC matches, so crowded no one else was admited). \n\nI love the 3 dollar jack and cokes (24/7 - 365), and the hot wings here are to fall back in your chair and die for. Not to mention the Tempe location has some very attractive eye candy for me and my entourage. \n\nAsk me about a good sports bar for UFC and this is it.
5	So my wife and I walked into Vintage 95 two weeks ago.  Looking for lunch and a spot for New Years Eve dinner.  Wow! I said to myself.  Been looking for a place like this in the east valley forever.  Cozy, comfort with a great fireplace inside and killer patio outback.  \nWe had lunch on the comfy couch in front of the fireplace.  Great wine list,  well thought out menu that delivers, and service that fits the food and atmosphere.  \n\nWent back with party of 6 for New Years Eve dinner.  The experience was great and the price for the fixed menu was amazingly low for the quality.  The staff was a little busy with the place being packed as it was, but again they delivered the goods.  \n\nThanks Vintage 95....we've been waiting for you for a long time.
5	This is the best starbucks I've been to, and trust me I have been to a few. The drive thru here gets pretty busy so you gotta hope that you get lucky and catch it when its quiet. The workers here have always been friendly and they crank the orders out pretty fast. I like to get my breakfast sandwhich and a drink in the mornings. I wish this place was 24 hours so I could come by after my late night workouts.
5	This place was amazing the food was so yummy and the chips and salsa amazing ..Its a casual dining place you can tell its been around for a long time and that's whats good about it. It was packed when me and my husband went but that's how it is there all the time. People love real food and a real dining experience. Its not a big place but I think its worth it even if its small spot. The enchildas are to die for.
3	"""**Old Sticky Rice Under Soy Sauce Container Alert**\n\nFirst congratulations on 2010 New Times \Best of Phoenix\""""!! \n\nCute, but typical little Thai place on Indian School Road. \n\nWent on a quiet Friday night, not busy at all. I noticed that it was kind of warm in there, hey AC anyone? \n\nAlso, agree with Thomas, the tables were kind of like really huge and made me feel awkward for just two people. A smaller table with a Lazy Susan would have worked better, but I didn't go there to table shop, I went to get some Thai on, and seeing what this Best of New Times stuff is all about anyways. \n\nService was slow, I would have been more OK with it if it was busy, but they had two other customers besides us. \n\nWon Ton soup was very good, huge portions and very flavorful. But when I reached to get the soy sauce I was startled!! Sticky white rice (from another customer) was under the bottom of the Soy Sauce container. It really freaked me out, talk about a bum trip. My smile turned way upside down into an instant frown. WTF? When you clean a table, take a little more care please! Actually look under the condiments, forget the Lazy Susan, how about Lazy employee? \n\nTried the obligatory Pad Thai, pretty good, hot, large portions. Another obligatory forgettable Beef dish. Decent, but nothing to write home about. \n\nBut the warm air, slow service, and the Sticky Rice Incident of 2010, make we wonder how reliable the Phoenix New Times \""""Best of\"""" is in terms of its yearly awards. For me, this was Best of Nothing. Best of give me a break 2010 more like it.  If this is \""""the best\"""", I would hate to see the worst!  Yikes!!\n\nI may be back, or not. There are better Thai places out there. It was decent and the portions were really big. Oh, and I thought the prices were a tad higher than average but portions are, again, big.  \n\nPhoenix New Times \""""Best of Old Sticky Rice Under Soy Sauce Container, 2010\"""""""""""

4	"""This race was fantastic! For their inaugural event in Phoenix, they marketed the crap out of it and brought out a huge crowd. From the pre-race information via email to the expo to the actual event and post-party, it was very well run. The volunteers were all very helpful and positive. The 5k course was flat and fast but not spectacular - it just wove around a commerce park, including a silly little \run up, now turn around and run back\"""" and was narrow at parts (particularly the beginning...hard to find space), but the 15k course looked nice. \n\nAs for the swag, a lot of people were wearing the jackets, but I'm not sure I'm a fan or that mine will get a lot of use. The finisher's mug was a great idea (and the pickup for them was again, very well organized). I expected lukewarm sludge, but the Ghirardelli hot chocolate was hot and delicious. The chocolate fondue was just not appetizing after a run so I skipped that and I'm not sure what to do with the mug now, but it was a detail I really liked. Hot Chocolate Run, I'm impressed!"""""""
1	This was my first visit to this new location of OSF in the chandler mall, and I'll tell you right now, I don't know if the other locations are this bad, but I will not be returning... If you're wondering why, read on, you'll see.\n\n\n---Service---\nWe had a table of 10, which i understand can be difficult, but in a restaurant this big that seats probably 150 people or so, they shouldn't have trouble with a table of 10. We were seated promptly enough, and our waitress took drink orders while we were still waiting for half of our crew. Once everyone else showed up she took their orders, but completely forgot my friend. He eventually got a water, but by that time we were about half way done with our meal. When the food that we ordered arrived, my friend who didn't get a drink also didn't get his entr\u00e9e. It came out about 5 minutes after everyone elses. My wife and I ordered garlic cheese bread as an appetizer and we didn't get it until 10 minutes after we were done eating dinner. The waitress said the kitchen was backed up, which I don't buy at all. She simply forgot to place the order until i mentioned it was missing, plain and simple. When the bill came we noticed that the two drinks we ordered were missing from the tab and we notified the waitress of her mistake. What she should have done was apologize for the poor service and numerous mistakes she made and comp'd the drinks and the garlic bread, but instead she corrected her mistake and she threw away an opportunity win some brownies points and any kind of a reasonable tip. Sadly, this had to be some of the worst service I've received at a restaurant in recent history.\n\n\n---Atmosphere----\nAs far as the restaurant itself is concerned, they did a really good job converting a rather eclectic Mexican place into a nicely furnished and modern feeling Italian joint. Our party was seated closer to the front of the restaurant, and because they left the outer doors of the two doored entry way wide open, whenever anybody would come inside there was a giant gush of cold air that would sweep in, making everyone at my table cold while trying to enjoy out no-longer-hot food. What's the point of having two entry doors if you leave the outside doors wide open!! Seriously people. It was pretty noisy and chaotic inside as well. All the waiters and waitresses seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The nature of the building also lends itself to being acoustically boisterous, that is to say, this isn't the place to come if you're in the mood for a quiet dinner with your loved one. \n\n\n----Quality----\nNone of this even speaks to the quality of the food, which is to say, quite sub par considering the prices on the menu. My wife and I ordered the whole wheat spaghetti with mushrooms and marinara sauce. The portion size was smaller than average for a $10 plate, and the sauce was way to wet and there was way to much of it. My spaghetti was drowning in a thin red soup. I've made better at home! My brother in law ordered the chicken parm and his meal was just as bland and boring. The serving of spaghetti he got was tiny, and the chicken breast wasn't even breaded, which may be healthier for you, but it's not chicken parm unless that chicken is deep fried and crispy. The salad we got before the meal was sub standard by any means, low quality ice berg with a few tiny croutons. The creamy pesto sauce that came with it was good, but not so good that it warrants drowning your lettuce in it (which is was). The cheesy garlic bread that we received ten minutes too late was actually pretty decent although a bit greasy for my taste. The sourdough bread was fresh and warm, however, don't expect to get a fresh loaf if the kitchen is out of knives, apparently they won't bring you one unless they have a fresh knife to give you as well. The ice cream we got after the meal was decent enough, I enjoyed the flavor of the spumoni, however, there were ice crystals in it, which leads me to conclude the ice cream tub had been left out and refrozen after a while, ruining the smooth texture it should have. There's no excuse for that. \n\n\n---Summary----\nI don't give out 1 star reviews very often, as I'm usually easier to please, but last night it seemed like it was consistently one thing after another that just piled on top of each other. Eating here made me long for olive garden, which at the very least is quieter and as far as I can tell, has much better food. I can only imagine what the lease is costing them for that location, and I'm sad to say it, but I actually hope they go out of business to save anyone else from the experience of dining there. Maybe they can turn things around, maybe they can't. From the other reviews I've seen so far, it appears as though they're making a habit of pissing off their customers. So there's nothing left to say but good riddance, I hope whoever takes over that space next actually puts some thought into how to run a restaurant.
4	Visited 5/8/12...\n\n\nWhat can I say, its Cracker Barrel.  Have been there many times.  Never reviewed before now.  Don't know why. \n\nSouthern food.  Had country fried steak, mashed potatoes, fried oakra.  It all tasted very good.  \n\nWent in for dinner.  But found myself very tempted when I was given a Breakfast Anytime menu.  Not too many places that I would try the breakfast menu in the evening, but this might be a place I will have to remember for breakfast in the evening fix.
5	Steve runs his own business, and provides a wonderful personal level of service. The tour was on time, professionally conducted, informative, and fun.  Steve pointed out details about what to look for, history, geology, where to eat, etc. We were in Phoenix on business, had only one day available, and wanted to see the most of the Grand Canyon. We took the day tour which included a stop at Montezumas Castle. We saw a lot of different gorgeous views of the canyon with this tour and learned alot. Great value too. I will definitely book AZ Scenic Tours again.
4	This is my typical spot I go to when I want some good Hawaiian/Korean BBQ.  This place is just like places back home in Hawaii.  The owners are from Hawaii.  I love this spot because this is the only place in the valley where I can find a quick korean bbq stuff.  The other Hawaiin spots are good too but don't serve Meat Jun or all cool Korean side dishes.  My favorite dishes are the meat jun and kalbi.  The kalbi has great flavor but its a hit or miss on the portions.  Some times I get surprised and there is more than usual but sometimes I get pissed and wonder if I should come back for Kalbi here again.  The Meat Jun is always a huge portion.  Probably cause the meat doesn't cost as much as kalbi meat.  It's a great alternative for people looking for good Korean BBQ.  Most korean restaurants are way more expensive than here and more sit in restaurants.  I always order out at this place but I did notice the nickel and diming they do with all the small stuff like refills and stuff.  I hate when places do that too but its a rough economy and the owner have always been super cool with me so that stuff doesn't bother me I guess since the food is good.
3	First time I've been there and glad to see a independent Mexican restaurant in that neighborhood. The food was good and I did enjoy my meal.  \n\nThe chips were served warm, fresh from fryer.  They didn't have an after taste; just good chips.  The salsa I understand is really good however it wasn't really wow that day; tasted like something was missing.  \n\nI went to eat with someone who loves this place and she thought the salsa was missing something that day as well.  \n\nQuick service, good food; I'd go back and looking forward to it.
5	Like the other reviewers said, the produce is very cheap and of good quality.  They offer a growing selection of organic produce also, as well as other organic offerings.  They have a self serve spice area where you can buy as much or as little as you want, so it is great if a recipe calls for something  you don't normally use so you won't buy a lot and waste it.  The trail mixes in the bulk food area are tasty and the beer and wine is reasonably priced.  \n\nThe best thing is if you shop on Wednesdays, it is double ad day so you get the sales for the current week and the previous week.
4	I've been going to Kokomo for about 3 full punch-cards now.. I'm a light frequentor.  \n\nYes, they have a nice selection of froyo flavors that change from time to time (though not THAT often) and they always seem to offer at least a few dairy free yogurts (not that I personally care, but you'll notice some don't care non-dairy options).\n\nTheir selection for toppings is pretty sweet - I really appreciate the variety of fruits and natural options (ie. coconut shreds, almonds, pecans, berries, kiwis, mango, etc).\n\nWhen I was doing serious calorie couting for a while (yeah, crazy, I know!) I would always ask for their nutrition book (the gal was always very nice and kind to give it to me while I froyo browsed) and would figure out which one was going to cost me the fewest calories for the greatest enjoyment :)  Good thing fruits were basically calorie-free!  \n\nNo, but seriously, if you're watching your figure, don't be ashamed to ask for the nutrition book.. you'll be delighted to see that a lot of their options are around the 100cal range for 4oz.. and 4oz is actually pretty substantial (another plus is because you pay by the ounce, I would weigh my filled cup before my toppings were applied so I could eyeball 4 oz and THEN I'd load on the fruits!)... nice, eh?\n\nTheir staff has always been friendly and never rude or stingey with sample cups.. cuz I always sampled like hell!
4	After seeing a segment on Maizie's on the news one morning I had to check this place out and I must say I was very impressed. They have a pretty extensive menu and I had a blood orange cocktail that was to die for. I had a chicken dish while my hubby enjoyed the surf and turf special. Great deal for the money...I was surprised at the meals you can get for $12-$15 a plate. We shared the Half Baked cookie for desert....yummy! \n\nThe only reason I didn't give this place a 5 was because the parking is kinda screwy.
4	Been to OHSO a few times since opening and there is a lot to like about it.  First off, there beer selection is great!  There is a wealth of choices available, many of which are not commonly seen or carried at most bars or restaurants. For the micro brew fans, you will love this place!  It gives you the ability to try some of the best selections out there from across the state and also some of the most popular out of state brewery's.  OHSO scores high marks on environment as well especially now that the new back patio has opened.  Great idea to do that especially with the canal behind it and the limited space up front.  If you get there during happy hour and wonder where all the people are, they are out back!\n\nMy only downside to OHSO so far has been the food.  I like the creative menu idea but nothing I have had has ever stood out in any way.  It is neither good or bad, just average.  I guess I tend to compare everything to 4Peaks and that is hard to compete with.  But overall, who cares.  Lets go drink some beer!
2	"""Cherry Blossom Noodle Caf\u00e9 used to be a wonderful restaurant. I don't know what's going on there now, but they appear to be having problems retaining good staff. Unfortunately this means the food quality has become very inconsistent. \n\nSpicy Curry Beef Linguine used to be a favorite; it was mildly spicy and had delicious curry flavor. Now, it's too spicy to eat, all from jalapeno peppers, and meanwhile the curry sauce has turned into a vague, bland gravy with no curry subtlety. \n\nMeals come with free, fresh baked bread, which is nice. The owners briefly experimented by removing the free bread offering, but it returned a couple weeks later due to customer complaint. Lesson: don't remove the niceties your customers have come to expect from you. \n\nThe service here used to be fabulous; now it is mediocre on a good day and terrible on a bad day. You will be held hostage for your check. Your waiter will come ask \is everything alright?\"""" before you have taken your first bite of food and then never return to see if you need anything else, avoiding all attempts at eye contact."""""""
3	"""My husband and I saw The Lodge featured on Planet Green's \Best Food Ever\"""" series for its Sasquatch Burger, which replaces buns with grilled cheese sandwiches. We went with a group of friends on a Sunday night. It was surprisingly crowded, but we were able to fit our group of seven into a tiny booth, because the restaurant has open seating. \n\nTwo of our friends got the Sasquatch, and told us the bread was just too much. My husband got the pretzel burger, which was super tasty. I got the grilled cheese and tomato soup. A simple staple, nothing super exciting. \n\nThe crowd was very \""""college frat boy\"""", but the food and prices were good."""""""
3	Sushi was ok, Crazyfish was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better. Service was great, placed an order as its one of the only sushi places that has sea eel, and the waitress came back to tell us that they ran out of sea eel... Not that its very famous or something a lot of ppl eat, which was weird and it was also one of the reasons we went there. \n\nNot sure if we'll come again, maybe next time we'll call ahead to make sure they have sea eel
5	Pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  It's nice to see a place that fits this atmosphere and doesn't charge an arm and a leg for it.  Everything on the menu was great (although the mushroom pizza had a pile of spinach on it???) and the service was friendly and efficient.  Everyone recommends the planks, as well as La Bocca themselves, and there's no wonder why.  They were fantastic.  Sit on the patio if it's not 100 degrees out and have a great evening.  We'll be back for sure.
1	I used to love this place and would eat there often dealing with hour long waits.  My family loves the rocking chairs and checkers games to play while waiting.  Over the years I had noticed the quality of food was spotting with sometimes good, sometimes bad but we continued to go.  The last time we waited over an hour, the kids were tired and hungry and we were thrilled when we finally got a table.  Being they were so bust service was slow.  We waited forever for drinks and to place our order.  About 40 minutes later our food came.  My daughter was sitting next to me and my son was sitting next to my husband.  My husband has ordered a breakfast meals with everything.  He took a large piece of ham off his plate and gave it to my son.  My son took one bite and said it didn't taste good and he wasn't hungry.  Thinking he was just being difficult, I said he had to eat it.  I watched him gag through another bite and realized something was wrong.  My husband then looked at it and smelled it and the ham was BAD.  I mean really BAD like off color and smelled rotten.  I was in shock.  That could make someone really sick.  We told the waiter who was not surprised at all.  Just offered to take it back and take it off the bill and replace it??   I was shocked and really worried about my son getting sick.  The manager was not concerned and acted like I was overreacting.  \nMy family has never gone back but I was talking with my neighbor the other day and he said the same thing happen to him.  I am not sure how this could happen.  How does bad food get out of the kitchen?  How could no one notice?  I will never go back!
1	DO NOT USE THEM! I should have know better based on the other Yelp reviews.  I picked up my clothes and 3 pairs of slacks had damage to them. The damage was located in the same place on all 3 pairs.  I was told the owner would call me the next day to discuss. The owner never called. 6 days later, I called them.  The owner is nowhere to be found. I ended up speaking to the manager who was rude, disrespectful and couldn't care less about how she treats customers. They didn't care at all and told me there was nothing they would do. DO NOT GO TO THIS CLEANERS, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!
3	"""So I'm torn on how to rate this place star-wise because honestly, there were a few things that were 10 stars and there were a few things that were 1 star. So let me break it down for you. We walked in to this cool little spot on the Sunday before Memorial Day and it was about half full. It looked like it was VERY groovy but I seriously had to use my phone to walk around because it was SO dark. We sat at the bar and not one of the bartenders addressed us for like 15 minutes. Maybe they couldn't see us? Anyhoo the wine list is interesting and I was having a hard time choosing something. The one bartender that finally waited on us had NO personality. I asked for a taste of a few things they had by the glass. They sounded very interesting but I had never heard of quite a few of them and I pride myself on knowing my wine. The first one I tried was a syrah blend that had something to do with chocolate and it was just that...too chocolatey. My friend ordered a glass of the Justin Cabernet which is always a safe bet. I then asked for the Tannat they had by the glass. It was awful. It taste like it had been opened for days. I told our personality challenged bartender and he went and tattled on us to maybe the manager? The manager then came over and was pleasant if a bit condescending at first. He said \well have you ever had a Tannat? and I said \""""actually, all the time, I know what they're about and that is no Tannat\"""" he then did agree with me and said \""""just tell me what you're looking for\"""" I told him I wanted a Cabernet Franc or Grenache which they didn't have either by the glass. He ended up pouring me something that really was delicious. He definitely redeemed the evening because he was professional and helpful. We then ordered the flatbread with pesto and a few different cheeses and it was seriously one of the better flatbreads I've ever had. They had two guys playing live music and they were very good. So my break down is:\nAtmosphere - 4\nAttitude - 1 except for the knowledgeable bartender, he gets a 10\nFlatbread - 10\nQPR - 10...for those non-winey's this is quality price ratio"""""""
5	I love this place.\n\nI just went this (late afternoon)- on a Sunday, thought they closed a 6, but they closed at 5pm. No matter, they took me anyway.  At 4:50, I felt kinda guilty, but they were very nice about it.\n\nA relaxed, luxurious pedicure was followed with a Shellac manicure.  They do an excellent job with both- and I appreciated not getting rushed because they were there far after normal closing (there were several clients there).  Friendly employees, clean environment, two really nice LCD TVs on walls.  Their massage chairs are in good repair and have a million features. \n\nVery thorough, careful work.  Nail trimming and shaping excellent, the whole experience was great.  Excellent callous removal work on the feet. Nice massage on legs, feet, hands, and arms.\n\nIf you haven't done Shellac, it's a must-do for your hands.  That stuff stays on forever, and keeps your nails from breaking, if you are prone.  Looks good for weeks.\n\nIf you need a nail place in North Phoenix, I highly recommend Paradise Nails.
4	"""Yo! I found a new awesome hidden sushi place to Yelp about!!!!\n\nWait, three people have already Yelped it. \n\nAnd apparently it's been open for 2 years already. \n\nNever mind.\n\nIn any case, the first time I ever noticed Moto was some weeks ago as I stepped out of Basha's - a Basha's I never go to either since I almost always take AZ-51 home after work. But somehow that day I decided to take 16th St all the way down and Moto caught my eye, although I had no idea what it was still. \n\nFast forward to today, another day I decide to randomly drive down 16th St.\n\nAnd I hit Glendale Ave.\n\nAs I wait at the light, I think. Now, I don't think too often, but for some reason today, I did. And I thought \There's that Moto again. What's its deal?\""""\n\nAnd so I pulled into the Basha's lot, parked and walked up. A nice crossed out McDonald's golden arches symbol greets you as approach the door, which kicks ass considering McDonald's is in the same parking lot. \n\nI knew I was going to like this place already, even though I still didn't know what the hell it was. \""""Go Your Own Way\"""" by Fleetwood Mac was blaring from the speakers. Was this a biker bar? A car-themed burger joint?\n\nOnly one way to find out.\n\nIn I went, and a cool, contemporary restaurant layout was in front of me, with a bar full of good stuff beckoning. I decided today that I was going to sit at said bar, which was the best thing I could have done - I engaged in conversation with the server and the sushi chef the entire time and got the lowdown of the place.\n\nMoto used to be a Shogun Express once upon a time, but the owner of the chain wanted to do something a notch higher and sold all the Shoguns and turned this location into Moto. The menu is eclectic and witty, offering a variety of rice bowls and sushi, along with buffalo burgers and \""""sushi ice cream\"""" for dessert (a great concept called Mojos, where ice cream and brownie are rolled in a layer of rice krispies and then sliced like sushi and served in a bowl). They have a generous happy hour menu and All You Can Eat Saturdays from 11am-2:30pm. \n\nI asked them how business was going and they said it's been really good, and it has become a local hangout full of regulars in north central Phoenix, which is awesome. I appreciate that this part of town has some great places like this and not just stuck with Panda Express (or even Shogun Express for that matter). \n\nAs for the food, I wasn't feeling particularly hungry so I just got unagi (eel) nigiri and an 8 piece spicy hamachi (yellowtail) roll. I'd say they were pretty well done, and although I thought Hana's sushi was better in the quality of the fish as well as presentation (he's not called Mr. Sushi Rock Star for nothing), for the price and also the taste I thought what I had here at Moto was still an awesome deal. I scored both orders plus a large Kirin Light (which came with a frosted 1.5 pint glass) for $12. Not bad. Not bad at all.\n\nThe fact that there was no pretentiousness at all here and that the servers and sushi chef were really friendly to a random confused guy dressed in his dorky office clothes, I give them high marks. Definitely another place to come back with friends (and also to partake in All You Can Eat Saturdays - you can bet your ass I'm there!). \n\n4 stars."""""""
5	"""Ha!\n\nSo, we ran into the local fry's for something - probably wine - and when we got to the checkout counter, we asked if there was a great place for sandwiches around and the lady was like scratching her head and like \no\"""".  Hmmm...  She seemed to remember someone mentioning a place...  \n\nI'm pretty sure we took a wrong turn and literally stumbled upon this sweet little sandwich spot with food that is just...  oh me!  oh my!  so good.  I ordered the most delictable chicken salad sandwich!  Afterwards, I couldn't help but wonder, why the hell doesn't that local lady know about this place?!?!  Seriously.  So good.\n\nOn a sunny day, the huge picnic table littered lawn here hosts droves of peeps just waiting to dig into deliciousness to the tune of deli.  This place easily makes the top ten restaurants to visit while we're in Tempe.  Eat here with your honey if you're looking for good grub in the area.  It's cafeteria style farm fresh food and fun!"""""""
2	I too rarely shop at Walmart and this has to be one of my all-time least favorites! This is a Neighborhood Market and not a Super Center so only go here if you are in search of groceries, cleaning supplies, or personal care products. I solemnly swore to myself the other night I would NEVER shop at this location again. Since moving to the area about five months ago they have had white onions on only two of my visits. White onions are a pretty imperative veggie to have on hand! They also do not have much diversity in their vegetables (ie: no basil). The bean and legume section is seriously lacking  as well. No garbanzo beans? At least they have a fairly decent liquor, wine, and beer selection, but Safeway has much better prices.
5	I've been putting off writing this review for ages, mainly because I love it so much that I want to do it justice. You're intimidating me, Postino! You're intimidating me with your loveliness!\n\nJust get your butt to the Monday/Tuesday happy hour special. Just do it and get it over with for the first time so henceforth you will realize that it is where you need to be on Monday and/or (yes there have been a few occasions I have gone two nights in a row DON'T JUDGE ME) Tuesday night. \n\nYou get any bottle of wine and a plate of the most decadent bruschetta, for $20. We're not talkin' a few little slices of bread with some chopped romas and basil... We're talking about full-flavored, substantially protein'd, tasty-ass bruschetta here, folks. You get to choose 4 of the 12 varieties they offer, and you get 4 slices of each. That way you and whoever you go with, can try them all. TWO PIECES OF EACH FOR ME AND TWO OF EACH FOR YOU, NO CHEATING. I'm watching you. And counting. And nomming. \n\nHere are my favs:\nThe prosciutto w/ figs and marscapone\nSmoked salmon w/ pesto\nBrie & apples w/ fig spread\nTomato jam & fresh sheeps milk cheese\n\nGood god I want it and I want it now.\n\nSome of the wines I've had are excellent. Some are just ok. That happens when you frequent this place as much as I do, and their wine list is ever-changing. I have discovered some of my favorite wines here, and nothing ever that I would turn my nose up at. \n\nI've now written so much about their food and wine that I am going to skip right over ambiance. It's awesome. End of story. And well worth the sometimes 1 hour wait.\n\nProbably my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Probably.
5	My uncle has been telling me for years that his picture hangs right next to Ernie Banks. Naturally I told him he was full of crap. So when my other uncle flew down from San Francisco for spring training, we decided to see if he was really telling the truth. \n\nThe chopped liver appetizer tray was really good considering I've never had it nor was I even remotely interested by the sound of it.  I had a salad which was good (how can you really mess up a salad.)\n\nNow I ordered the prime rib rare with fresh horseradish and a baked potato.  It was singlehandedly the best piece of red meat I've ever eaten.  Cooked to perfection (as was my wife's and uncle's steaks) just melted in my mouth like butter.  I've been to Fleming's, the Keg, and various other steakhouses, and they don't come close to this.  The horseradish was incredibly fresh with a lot more kick to it than normal.\n\nThe service was excellent with a very friendly staff.  The manager was more than helpful in trying to help us locate the picture of my uncle and his baseball team from Chicago.  He narrowed down the area for us and after 3 minutes of searching, low and behold, there it was.  19 years later the picture is still there.  I will go back, and not to visit the picture, but for the great food that awaits me.
3	We recently had a leak in the water line to our refrigerator, and called Scottsdale Plumbing Company (SPC) to help us, because it was a weekend and an emergency. I'm not sure how their weekend rate compares to other plumber weekend rates, but I thought it was rather high. Nevertheless, the plumber from SPC came within an hour of our call and helped us stop the leak. Rather than fix the water line and rack up the weekend rate hours, though, he suggested he leave the water line as it was (with the leak now stopped), and come back the following week when he would only have to charge their normal weekday rate. I really appreciated that suggestion, because it showed he recognized how high their weekend rate was, and that he wanted to help us save money, while getting the job done.\n\nI'll have to check what their regular weekday rate is to see if I'll call them again, but overall, I'm glad SPC was there to help us in a pinch, and glad their plumbers are honest and considerate.
5	"""Again, FULL DISCLOSURE: #1 I do work here. #2 this review is from a dining experience I had last July (I'm slow to the party here on yelp - have had an account for a year and a half, never posted anything, and now want more than one review under my belt!). That being said, my experience is still valid :)\n\nI had my first real sit down dinner at 25 degrees last night and can't say one bad thing! I took my friends in from out of town and they had a great time as well. We got the tail end of Happy Hour, so I started with a $2.50 PBR (hey, the economy's hit all of us hard!) and so did another guest. My other friend was very excited they had Hoegaarden on tap. I'd been dying to try the #2 which is the more \Italian\"""" style burger, with Pesto Sauce, Prosciutto, Roasted Tomatoes, and Burrata Cheese (it's like Mozzarella). Another friend chose the #1, a sirloin burger with 1000 Island, Arugula, Bacon, Caramelized Onions and Gorgonzola and Crescenza cheeses. While waiting for the burgers, we had the \""""half & half\"""" of sweet potato fries and onion rings. I normally can't stand sweet potato fries, but I couldn't stop eating them! The onion rings were great dipped in the garlic parmesan sauce. After I finished my beer, I had to try the Red Head in Bed, which has Ketel One Citrus, a splash of sparkling wine, lemon juice, simple syrup and muddled strawberries - so tasty and refreshing! The Burgers came out perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. I had no intention of finishing mine, but couldn't stop eating! I was soooo full, but incredibly satisfied by the end of my meal.\n\nI have to mention that Kelly was an awesome server too - she never hovered - totally understood that we were a group of friends catching up, but was always there when we needed her!\n\nThanks for a great experience 25 degrees!"""""""
2	I hate giving this place such a poor review, but over all, I wasn't all that impressed.  I came here last night for dinner for the first time, and I can't say that I'm really interested in going back any time soon.\n\nI was hungry, and wanted something different then the usual. I've driven by this place a zillion times, and figured I'd give it a try.  I went in and paid the $11.50 for a plate of food, and I really didn't like it all that much.\n\nI built my own dish, but the meat looked really weird, and the bowls that you put it in were somewhat small.  The selection was meat, pork, chicken and fish. I went with the meat.  I topped it with a few veggies, some sauces, and the cook threw it on the grill. It came out fine, but the meat was just weird.  It was shaved, and was kinda tough.  Veggies and toppings were fresh, but limited.  More salad topping stuff then anything else.  Tomatos, cucumbers. carrots, celery....weird (but healthy) selection.  I was hoping for more variety there.\n\nThe staff here was friendly and helpful, I will give them that.  Place looks like it might have been an old fast food joint at one point?\n\nI guess Im just not overall impressed, and had better experiences with Mongolian style cooking.  Sadly, this was not one of them.  :-(
5	I've been a huge fan of this little shop for quite a while. Ever since I saw them on the news and when down and had their gelato and talked to the owners, I knew there was something special here. This place is owned by a lovely and very nice couple who are passionate about what they do. The husband learned the art of making gelato from a master in Italy. You can taste the quality ingredients he uses. Their pistachio flavored gelato is like no other place I've been to. The reason they were on tv a while back is because he made a white truffle(mushroom) gelato for a local chef. I mentioned seeing the spot on tv and he offered me a taste of his creation. It was deep and musky like truffles are but paired expertly with the sweetness and texture of the gelato. A true master of his craft if you ask me. Highly recommended.
3	Yes, another case of following the wrong Yelp!  I love burgers.  This place was supposed to have great burgers; mine came out cold, without the fries we ordered, without ketchup.  Does the wonderful interior make up for it? Well, after the waiter saw that I like warm food, he stepped it up and delivered an A-OK burger.  The sweet potato fries and molten chocolate thingie far surpassed the burgers, but then again there are very little choices in Phoenix after 9PM.  It almost seems like we're on Eastern time.
3	I agree with the sentiment that this place has definite potential to garner more stars, but hasn't quite reached that potential as of yet.\n\nThe service is friendly, competent, and there's nothing lacking there, thankfully. My questions about the dishes and ingredients were answered professionally and accurately. Cool. \n\nI had the pasta all'amatriciana dish, despite the fact that it not being traditional (with the addition of onions and hot peppers, etc.), was fairly solid. Nothing amazing, and of course not terrible. The portions are, yes, small, but after an appetizer and some wine, I did feel satiated. I do very much appreciate the traditional usage of the flavorful guanciale (jowl bacon), however. But I couldn't help to feel that the onions, and especially the hot peppers, overpowered the taste of that cut of bacon, which saddened me, as that's my absolute favorite part of the most delicious pig. Oh, pig.. how I adore your delicious.. pig parts.. oh.. yes.. But I pruriently digress.\n\nI would definitely return for the occasional visit if I were in the area, but I sadly can't say that I would go out of my way to visit. There is definite room for improvement, and I hope that PastaBAR takes advantage of this.
2	Wow, I think this is probably the filthiest gym I've ever been to. I guess I'm charmed in that respect, as not only all other reviewers have mentioned its marginal cleanliness, but I was given the EXTREME narrow eyes by my gym partner for mentioning it. We used a really fun machine (the ONLY saving grace of this gym) that kicks ass, literally, and the first thing I noticed was that the foot pads had major dirt and grime buildup... yuck. Made me wonder the last time someone went through there with a little 409. The shower and locker room facilities were ridiculously dated, and perhaps even more annoying than any of these factors combined was the relentless and shameless advertisements everywhere. Tanning booths, vitamins, massage, towels? Jesus Christ, someone just get me to the YMCA!
4	You're going to go to whatever grocery store is closest to you, but usually you have 2 or 3 options within the same radius. If you live in the area, you should really consider making this your store. And here's why...\n\n1. No member cards.\nAlbertson's started doing member cards a few years ago much to my dismay... I protested and pissed and moaned because I knew what it meant... At the time, they were the last store to not have such a program and I would've gone miles out of my way to shop there for that reason alone. These savings cards are bullshit - first of all, they take personal info from you and use it to market to you and monitor what you buy. It's a privacy issue and a spam issue. Second, these fucking cards cost money - you really think you're saving anything? It costs them millions to launch such a campaign - they have to get that money somewhere. They get it by raising the prices of shit. I noticed it right away as soon as the cards were implimented. Even with the savings card, my groceries were more expensive than before. Fuck that. Anyway, they finally got rid of the cards again - so I love them again. Thank you Albertson's.\n\n2. This place is a den of hot chicks. \nStrippers, college students, hot nurses, and all sorts of sexy singles shop here. I've never seen such a hot group of 20-30somethings shopping for groceries in one place. Now, I shop later at night usually - but it doesn't seem to matter too much what time of day you go. It's a good looking crowd. Single people, take your carts and smash into someone you find attractive and strike up a conversation... ask some cutie if they know the best way to squeeze a melon (even though you thunk em, I think).\n\n3. Selection... \nthis place has a decent selection of wine and organic products and produce and deli and whatever else. It's not the best store I've ever been to, but it's good. In fact, that's where that 5th star went - this place could be a little better if it was a little bigger or newer... Still, it's got everything I'm ever looking for which is all you can really ask for from a grocery store. They stopped carrying the bread I like and I had to ask a few times and submit a few cards, but they started carrying it again. So I can't help but like this store. \n\n4. Prices...\nIt doesn't have the best prices on everything, but for someone like me who doesn't do coupons, my grocery bill is smaller here than it is at Fry's with their savings card. \n\nYou can also get gas here and their gas isn't that bad. It's also normally pretty cheap. If you live in the area, give this shopping center a try...
4	"""A great place to shop for Asian foods. My wife is from Thailand and I like both Thai and Chinese food a lot. This place is one of the few places in the Valley you can buy authentic items from Thailand, China, Taiwan, Japan, and other Asian countries. They have a really nice selection of sauces and spices. \n\nIn the past I've poked around the grounds as well. They have other shops surrounding the market where you can buy \Asian-related\"""" items such as furniture or DVDs. The Chinese Cultural Center is worth a visit while you are there. And there are some nice pagodas and statues to check out as well in the park. It's a nice way to spend a hour or so shopping and walking around on a weekend afternoon.\n\nAlso, they have a little cafeteria inside the market in the back corner to your right as you enter the market. The Chinese food was OK, but the freshly made green tea was very impressive tasting!"""""""
5	"""I have my grandmother's feet.  Wide at the toe, narrow at the heel - generally hard to fit.  I've never just been able to walk into a store and find things that will fit.  I can't imagine ordering shoes over the internet as some of my friends do.  \n\nAbout 5 years ago I went into a store specializing in \wide feet\"""" and it was so sad I never even tried again.  Bad bad bad.  Birkenstock style sandals and white tennis shoes in the style nurses used to wear.  I pretty much ran to the door after that.  \n\nI found this place purely by looking it up on Dex.  Coincidentally, it's close to where I was working and so poof - it showed up near the top of the list.  I decided to take a chance and run there for lunch.  WOW!  \n\nOtherwides has women's sizes 5-13 in W-WW and men's in 7-18 3E-6E.  And they don't LOOK like wide shoes.  I got a great little pair of sparkly strappy bronze heals with little sequins on the straps.  They were $49, really well made - and I made it through a day long wedding without hating my shoes even once.  Sold!\n\nI made myself hold back from also buying this awesome pair of beautiful red leather kitten heel shoes - but I don't know how much longer I'll be able to wait on that one.  They were SO awesome!\n\nI can't remember the last time I went to a shoe store where a guy sat down and actually put your foot into the shoe.  Even at Dillard's I find myself occasionally having to chase down someone to grab a box from the back.  \n\nI'll be making the trip back here again on a regular basis."""""""
2	I do fly frequently and I am not really a fan of PHX. Where do I start? Driving to the airport is easy. It is centrally located and I would rate it high in the convience department. After that, it's downhill. I don't park there -  I use a shuttle service such as the Parking Spot and get dropped off right out front. Much easier. Inside the terminals are good, most of the times the lines move, although why people cannot figure out how to use the self check kiosks, I don't know. It isn't rocket science. Security lines are rarely long and move quickly, but once inside you are stuck with limited services. Sure there are stores and Dick Clark's on the outside, but be prepared to fly hungry or wait in long lines on the inside. I fly Delta a lot and in terminal 3 you have a choice of Wendy's or the blue burrito...or vending machines...maybe pick up something at the newsstand...\n\nFor me the major issues are driving through the airport. The terminals are not user friendly. They are adequately marked 1-4 and have north side and south side. When picking up someone ask which door number they are coming out of - because you cannot stop long. Once the wheels on the bus stop going round and round security emerges as if by magic to instruct you to keep moving. Sit there and ignore them long enough and the ticket book appears - that's when it;s time to circle again (thanks, Bin Laden). Terminal three has one inconvenient turn while you are waiting for emerging traffic during your continual loop of the terminal - I have almost been t-boned a few times there. Another thing I don't like is their short term parking - it appears instantly and goes up a ramp. It is always in a spot I am not thinking it should be, so I miss it. Instead use the cell phone lot and wait for your party to call, circle around and take your chances with security.\n\nOn a positive note, the airport is a great place to people watch. I always follow the guideline of 2 hours early, so I get to sit and watch. People hanging in the bar getting drunk and forgetting they are flying when their name is paged, people late and OJ'ing it through the concourse, people wearing interesting outfits and being an international airport, you can see people from all over the world. Not to mention the occassional disruptions - is it a wonder SouthWest made a reality show about people in the airport? If you don't mind being hungry and bored, arrive early and watch the people. Some of them are worth the price of a ticket!
2	I'm really surprised this is one of the top rated Arizona Thai places on Yelp.  \n\nFirst, the prices are really expensive and the portions are small.  This might be forgivable if the food was amazing, but it wasn't.   We ordered Thai beef salad, pad thai, and panang curry.  The salad was the most disappointing of the bunch.  It was essentially 4 pieces of weird-textured meat over iceberg lettuce with onions and some kind of oily dressing.  The panang was ok, but nothing to write home about.  I'd say the pad thai was the best of what we ordered, but still not the best I've ever had and really expensive for the amount you're given.  We ate everything we ordered and still felt hungry afterward.  Normally when we order Thai food we end up totally stuffed and leave with leftovers.  And for less money and better food. \n\nIt was disappointing overall.  Definitely not worth the price.  We have no plans to return.  The quest for great Thai food in Chandler continues!
5	This place is fantastic.  Found it because we were up in the area.\n\nFirst off...it has the feel of an old diner...even through they remodeled.\n\nThe service was excellent...loved our waitress.  Seemed like she had been there a long time.\n\nCoffee was very good..always a plus!\n\nWe decided to start with a cinnamon roll before our brekkie.  OMG...it was no roll...it was the whole loaf.(i will post a pic soon).  It was delicious.  It has a cream cheese topping/icing and it is filled with cinnamon and apple.  Neither the icing or the dough were too sweet like you get at other places.  We each had a slice and still brought home a huge chuck...and for $2.99...\n\nFor breakfast we had pretty much the same thing...biscuits and gravy with eggs.  This was huge even though it was the small portion...for $5.\n\nI mentioned prices, because this place has outstanding pricing.  The menu looked great for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nAlso apparently you can preorder pasties that are made on Tuesdays only.\n\nWhat a great spot...glad we found this and I will make sure and visit whenever in the area.
3	"""I can't give my full support to a place that reeks of snobbery and unsatisfactory ice cream. Don't get me wrong, it's DELICIOUS ice cream. But, instead of saying, \That hit the spot.\"""" afterwards, I (and my comrades) always end up saying something more like, \""""Well now I want a f*cking truckload of ice cream. Should I get the triple scoop? No wait, I can't afford it. Damn.\""""\n\nHere's how to remedy falling into the unsatisfied trap: Completely overdo it. By upgrading to an ice cream sandwich, or an entr\u00e9e-sized sundae with three flavors of ice cream, toffee, cookie pieces, brownie bites, torched marshmallows, hot fudge sauce, and the kitchen sink, you'll not only leave satisfied (and slightly ill, in a good way) but you'll get to appreciate why the place constantly basks in its own glory. All of the toppings and ice creams are house made, gourmet and covered in glittering, artisan snob dust. When was the last time you had an artisan, snob-dusted blow torched marshmallow?\n\nThe verdict? Go big or don't go."""""""
4	I was in Mesa visiting my daughter and her family, noticed this place when got off the fwy on route to my hotel.  This was first visit for all of us, and it was well worth it.  We really enjoyed the food and the $3 Long Island ice teas.  The place is awesome.  I'm definitely going back on my next trip out to visit my family in AZ.\nOnly 1 knock on the place.....the waiting area is small, would be better if more chairs/benches.
5	Got a call from a friend today asking for a Vietnamese food recommendation in Phoenix .. and of course the answer was Saigon Nites.  AMAZINGLY friendly family owned business.  We go down to the desert every summer and we drive straight here from PHX.  Better than almost all of the Vietnamese SF places and definitely on par with So Cal.  Highly recommend the Banh Xeo - crepe and the soup stock is excellent.  Just had to yelp-it because I'm craving Vietnamese food and glad to see all the photos !  Oh and it's pretty cheap - usually under $25 for both of us
5	I went to Eddie's House while visiting Scottsdale and was surprised that it wasn't super packed...because our meals were fantastic. I talked to a couple local friends who said they had heard it's really good, but hadn't had the chance to actually experience it first hand. \n\nWe had reservations (since it was an official date-night) but we didn't need them. On a Saturday night there were many open tables at 7:30 p.m. I tell you this so you can take advantage of a delicious meal where you don't have to wait 30+ minutes before you can dine. \n\nBefore I get into describing the scrumptious food, I should mention that the rest of my experience is what contributes to me really loving this place. It's in a cute area that is easy to get to, lots of parking, and surrounded by galleries. The front door is over-sized, and I like that. We were seated outside and had the entire patio to ourselves for the first hour of our meal. Our server was SO nice and felt like a friend by the end of the dinner. Also, the decor is elegant but you also feel like you are having dinner at Eddie's house because it is surrounded by family pictures and unique artwork. \n\nThey start by putting a basket of warm bread and homemade sheets of crackers with this incredible pesto/butter concoction.  Needless to say, that was polished off quickly.  For our appetizer we got the Toasted Horseradish-Mashed Potato Stuffed Shrimp. This had a great balance of sweet and spicy, and a combo of seafood and starch...however you only get three. For salad we shared the iceberg wedge that was RIDICULOUSLY good. It was such a great mixture of dressing, tomato, lettuce, bacon, onions, and blue cheese...I was scraping my plate before they took it away. \n\nFor our main courses we split the special of the day which was a scallop dish that tasted fresh and indulgent at the same time, the waiter did a great job selling us on it. And of course the What's In This Steak out of pure curiosity. Let me tell you, that curiosity paid off big time. Please order it, you will not regret it. \n\nWe left happy, full, and ready to tell the world that Eddie's House is a underutilized gem in Scottsdale...go run and tell your friends.
5	We love Wag N Wash and so does our monstah, Rally! He's always so excited to go in, even if his feet skid around on the tile like it was an ice rink.  The prices are average or slightly below similar smaller pet food shops and the people who work there are always helpful.  Their selection of toys is great.  The food tends to be on the hippier side of things so don't go in there looking for crappy PetCo stuff.  \n\nAs far as the washing area goes, I love the concept and it always works well.  A raised steel tub with all of the accessories you could need.  Saves your back and keeps your semi-dry.  When he's not trying to eat the water from the spray, Rally really enjoys the tub area.  They also have a drying station but it is a bit loud for our pup.  \n\nSign up for the frequent-buyer program.  We have easily saved $100 thanks to the coupons they seem to send us every month!
4	So I have always had an addiction to salad bars but never trusted the quality nor the people at all-you-can-eat salad bars... talk about scary.\nThis is why I have come to be addicted to AJs.  I love love their salad bar.  There are a nice variety of salad toppings and it is very reasonably priced.  I can yaer on cottage cheese, bacon, noodles, and even some imitation crab meat too while I'm at it!   I also love their fresh soups too.\n\nI have been a loyal customer to AJ's seafood grotto, which always has the exact fresh fish I need for my cooking experiments but now I'm realizing just how great the rest of the AJ's store is as well.\n\nThis location is a little bit hidden but it is well worth it.  They employees are beyond helpful and rarely will you ever have to wait in line!
5	"""Recently, as my family coasted toward a national chain for a quick bite, I exclaimed \turn the car around! We are going to SCRATCH!\"""" Scratch Pastries is just the right size and off the beaten path just enough to feel unScottsdale. No plastic surgery in sight. I got the feeling everyone eating there was intelligent and interesting. I had their chicken sandwich and My Husband and stepson and I each grabbed a French Macaron to go ( a little pricey at $6.95) They are only 1 of 2 places I know where I can buy a French Macaron in town and they are AMAZING.  I walked out of SCRATCH having enjoyed fresh, organic, hand made food. We had a great conversation with the owner who mingled with his patrons and we had no irritated college server rushing us to get up so the next party could be seated. Instead, we sat, in peace, only overhearing the 2 French women and 2 elderly girlfriends speaking intelligently over their Brie sandwiches. Our 10 year old got a lesson in culture and fine ingredients and presentation and I was able to gaze across the space to a wall filled with uniformly framed fashion photos taken by the owner who was once a photographer in France. He married his model wife and moved here and opened this great spot. So the place has a fabulous story to go with the delicious eats. I am hooked."""""""
3	"""I'm not sure if Eddie V.'s is owned by a man destined for his adult life to live in the shadow of the eponymous musician or a marketer unafraid of lawsuits seeking to capitulate on the automatic association with the aforementioned, but I am sure it's a steak and seafood house hoping to use Asian influences as the secret weapon against Morton's, Capital Grille and several other nearby clones/competitors. (I'm surprised this didn't disqualify it from parental selection, but I realize that the undertones are largely dismissable if one does not latch onto them in the hope of eating something with a flavor that isn't salt.)\n\nOrnate but still permitting casual as few feel like dapper gentlemen and ladies on top of the world in 110+ degree heat, the decor is typical for its class and affable, straightforward service meets the expectations set by the price tag. I'd like to be writing a review of the more adventurous-sounding options here, but while I would feel more comfortable with \Hong Kong style\"""" steamed fish not being \""""mildly inspired by a Western interpretation of Hong Kong\"""" in a Chinatown, the presence of sushi conclusively made me averse to it. The following made the C. family cut:\n\n- Jumbo Gulf Shrimp ($14): Nothing colossal or unusual about the cocktail. \n- Hawaiian Yellowtail Sashimi ($15): A texture and flavor hit but tiny for the price.\n- Pacific Ahi Tuna ($29): A strong, soft high note, as was the accompanying fruit, vegetable and nut salad.\n- 12oz Filet ($40): Appropriately tender but disappointingly over-salted in the kitchen.\n- Sauteed Spinach ($5): Would've been better without the shameful pool of oil.\n- P-R Fries ($5): A massive, cheesy half-order that only truffle could have improved.\n- Blackberry Cobbler: Overpoweringly sweet. (Asian moderation was needed here.)\n- Molten Godiva Cake: Barely one stop short of chocolate overload but still too sweet.\n\nFor the contending class defined by its price range, Eddie V.'s offerings are a set of great ideas which unfortunately fall short in the execution even if it feels like not for a lack of trying. This restaurant relocated relatively recently and I'm unclear if they lost the magic or are experimenting trying to obtain some but for now I'd approach it with somewhere between cautious optimism and proactively limited expectations. That said, if it weathers the storm of increasing density of the formula in a few block radius, I'd try it again."""""""
1	"""Hubby has a thing for French Dips, so when the flier came in the mail advertising Rock Bottom's new Firehouse Specials, he really wanted to go, especially since we were in the area anyway. \n\nThe French Dip was on a \pretzel roll\"""" and my bite had soooooo much horseradish on it, I couldn't swallow it, and the bun was almost immediately mush. He also did not care for the beer \""""jus\"""" it came with. His sweet potato hash side looked overdone and simply not appetizing. He also had an Irish stout that he really liked.  I ordered a tasty portabello and spinach sandwich on a nice wheat roll with rosemary mayo. The fries that came with it were light and yummy. I thought I had by far the better of the two meals- until I spent a good part of the rest of the night on the potty. 'Nuff said. This is a family show."""""""
5	"""Have you ever just randomly gone to a place for lunch and it is amazing?  Just popped in with a couple people had had your socks blown off?  Well that definitely happened to me here.  My wife, and old high school friend, and I stopped by for lunch here after my wife had gotten here braces put on.  The portion sizes are smaller (but don't worry the price reflects this) so we were able to get a few different things and sample a bunch of stuff.\n\nBy the time it was all over I had some molotes, a tamale, the fish taco, and i think the memalita with al pastor.  The molotes are fantastic, it's kind of like a Mexican potato fritter.  Crunchy and delicious outside and the middle is fluffy and tasty.  The memalita is like a tostada but made with a sopa instead of just a regular tortilla.  The fish taco was perfect.  I don't really like fish, but the owner insisted I give it a try and I'm very glad he did.  It was by far, one of the best things I've put in my mouth.  To put it simply everything that I had was great.  And not just, \that was a good meal\"""" great, everything was tasting perfect had great texture and the owner answered any questions I had about the food.  I tried the horchata that my friend had, and usually I hate them, but this one was awesome.  I think it had almonds and cantaloupe in it but i'm not sure, either way it was out of sight. \n\nIf you are in the mood for some perfect Mexican food and want to try something just a little bit different head on down and get some amazing food."""""""
4	Secreto is one of my favorite restaurants in Ahwatukee especially because it's hard to find non-chain restaurants around here.  The atmosphere is really cool and the food is amazing.  I'm not a big fan of beef or pork so that really limits my options but the Madres Pasta Favorito is amazing!  It has the best sauce I've ever had and the shrimp and guacamole salsa add the perfect touch.  Make sure you save room for dessert because the flan is to die for.  The only negative thing I would say is that we made a reservation and they forgot about us so we waited for a long time.  I don't really mind though because we were enjoying drinks at the bar.
4	I am not a shopper. When I enter a store, I know what I want and usually the time spent in the store is spent on looking for that item and not browsing so much. That's how things started out in Smeeks but quickly turning into a shopping and browsing experience.\n\nIt had been years since I was in a candy store and to sit back and look at all the stuff that I want but cannot eat is agonizing. They have a ton of candy that is original from hard candy to chocolates to toffees to chocolate bars which leads me to why I was there. COFFEE CRISPS. I spotted them almost as soon as I walked in the store and as I stood and looked at the other candy surrounding them, it took me back to Canada. Crispy Crunch, Eat More, Caramilk, Smarties (not the tart candies - the candy covered chocolate) all of the things I haven't seen in years and I wanted to buy and eat to send me into diabetic coma but I held back and bought only what I came for...Coffee Crisps...and they were damn good! Smeeks, I'll be back to buy more someday, See you then!
4	Don't stop get it get it let me put some umpf in it! \n\nSo I had a recurring flat going on with my back tire. *Not Cool* I heard about Bike Saviours but being a newbie to the city and not one to believe the hype decided not to stop by. Wish I would have sooner! I walked JudyGoodBar into the building and low and behold there were 3 work stations with men working on their bikes of all sorts. To my surprise I was the least bit intimidated about being the only dame working on my JGB (there were other birds there but they were standing next to their men for moral support I guess) Well the last time I fixed a flat I was about seven and I forgot how easy it was, and I can't remember the man's name that was assisting me, but I was grateful that he instructed me from a distance so I learned how to use the tools. The sour part of my experience was that I have an old 92' Murray legend road bike with the step through frame and my tires are 26 1 3/8th which are a rare find, long story short I was in the shop for 2 hours trying to find a suitable inner tube for my tire. If that wasn't the issue the work would have taken about 30 minutes. None the less I had a blast and I got my barbie pink finger nails grimy and I got to sweat a bit. I also was able to adjusted my shifter cables which reminds me I need to put bike tools on my Christmas wish list preferably pink, periwinkle blue or a purple case. *Fingers X* My bill totaled a whopping $6 and I threw some extra dough in the tip jar and hopped on my favorite gal, tuned my IPod to some classic ska and took her for a cruise around the hood like I use to. Overall I have to say this is the go to place for beginners to the pros, the price range is reasonable the employees know what you need and are always around to lend some advice if asked. I am psyched to start the Wednesday ladies night and get my nails smudged again!
4	I came here after finding out that King Gyros is closed on Sundays.  After driving all the way from Chandler, I was not going home without some meat.  Thankfully Chicago Gyros was nearby and I remembered it had good reviews.  I had the Chicago gyro with Greek salad.  The gyro was very good.  Plenty of meet with good tzatziki sauce, tomato, and onion, wrapped in a chewy but not too heavy pita bread.  The flavor combination was just right and I devoured the whole sandwich.  I was not too impressed with the Greek salad.  For some reason, the dressing tasted a little bitter.  I also tried some of my friend's fries.  The texture was good.  Nice and fat.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  But somehow, I could not get enough potato taste out of it.  I'm not sure if it was their potato or their oil.  I'll just stick with the pita sandwich next time.  This place is way too far to drive to on a frequent basis, but they just opened Pita Heaven in Chandler and I think it is related.  I will try that next time.
1	This place is ridiculous and I won't be there anymore. My wife lived in Hong Kong before and initially we were happy when we saw the menu, which looks very authentic. But the experience went sour after placing the order. I ordered a mixed BBQ rice, which just involves cutting some BBQ and placing them over a bowl of rice. For some reason this took about 20 minutes! The server was very unfriendly when we were asking why such simple dish took so long.\n\nFor the food (after waiting for 20 minutes), the BBQ pork was above average, but the chicken and duck were not that fresh. \n\nWhat totally ruined the experience was checking out. THEY AUTOMATICALLY PUT THE TIPS INTO THE BILL!! As I said, their service was a joke, extremely slow and not friendly. Such service doesn't worth a penny of tips but they forced you to pay for it. This is definitely a place I won't go anymore.
4	This is where it all started for me. \n\nASU west was the foundation for my college education and I really enjoyed the size of the campus (not as big or chaotic as Tempe) and how they focused on the well-being of the student. Here the offices always knew what was going on in other departments and things didn't get lost in the shuffle. If I could have attended this ASU campus for all 4 years i would have. \n\nGood education, good teachers, great memories!
3	We came here to celebrate my boyfriend's Bday last year and found it to be a little on the stuffy side.  Dinner for the both of us was around $200 and I didn't feel it was money well spent.  Granted, we did order a ton of food and ate every last morsel...and didn't even have room for dessert.\n\nWe were seated in a table in a room that felt a little too stuffy & clammy and a little too cramped.  We got the lobster and thought it was pretty good (although on the chewy side), several oyster appetizers (the oyster Rockefeller was really heavy and dense) and escargot.\n\nMaybe we'll have to come back to check out the reversed HH that seems to be popular here.
5	Lets see where do i begin? Ok, beer on tap is great. Im an ipa hophead and odells is one of my favorites, oskar blues gordon knight is awesome as well. Had the newly tapped pranqster and was pleasantly surprised how smooth and drinkable it was. Bottled beer, start with bear republic racer 5 ipa, my personal favorite. Dales pale ale and stone sublimey black ipa would be my other choices. Food is awesome, had the new menu item tenderbelly bacon sandwich and will get again when available. The pro pasta appetizer had cheeses, meats, and mushrooms that were top notch. All the staff is friendly and attentive in their service which is a big plus. Happy hour all day sunday is so nice, and i wouldnt worry about some reviews of the neighborhood which i think is great and what attracted me in the first place. The music is also something that just makes this a more relaxing place to visit, I highly recommend this place for all the reasons stated. All my support to TMI and local business who do right by their customers!
5	"""The bar is a solid 4- 4 1/2 stars. Gotta love how everyone can just fit right in no matter what their outfit.  As long as you're willing to have a good time Bikini is willing to welcome you.  An absolute 2 extra stars for their DJ!  When we went on Friday, we were jamming to some awesome old school, 80's metal power ballads, blues, independent \chic\"""" music and some imported editions.  All of this together blended perfectly to create the perfect background music - as diverse as it's clientele.  We went up to ask the artists behind a few of the songs because they were so good and he was more than willing to share information.  It was awesome how passionate he was about the music. \n\nI'm almost tempted to take away a half star for the drinks.  My friend got a Long Island that cost $6 and came in a super skinny glass with tons of ice.  She said it wasn't super weak or too strong, but it was too small for that price.  I told her they must be \""""Scottsdale\"""" charging for the mixed drinks to make up for the cheap beer I'd heard about - and saw on everyone else's table.  \n\nParking is a super pain - especially in this time of super construction  and/or if there is an event at Trunk Space.  Be prepared to be creative or do some walking.  It's worth the effort."""""""
3	I thought that this place was ok. Nothing amazing as you would think from the amount of people flocking to the restaurant, but its reasonably priced and pretty good. I had the smoked salmon scramble and it was just ok. There were chunks of cream that didnt really get incorporated into the scramble and overall it was just okay. Definitely not something better than I could make at home. \n\nI guess that overall it is a solid place to grab some breakfast.
4	I have been a client for 5 years or so.  I'm a pedi only client and have been seen by various employees.  While they all follow the same protocol, some are better at callous removal or massage or nail painting than others.  Guess it just depends what you prefer.  I like the leg massage and not a lot of chatter, which they respect.  They try different services from time to time (sugar, hot stone massage, etc.), but they always ask if I want it first before doing it.  They never try to upsell me and are always kind and gentle.  I agree with another reviewer that if you have a particular color you like, you should bring it.  The polish selection isn't always great.
1	"""This place isn't a \bar...\"""" Its just a joke.\n\nWhat bar in its right mind shuts down at 9:50 on a Saturday night? Evidently Christoper's is the only one that comes to mind.\n\nWe walked in on a Saturday, sat down as there were still some 20 people sitting around having drinks, and were quite brusquely informed that they were closed and that we needed to leave. We asked what all the other folk were doing there, and we were informed that they were regulars and friends and that closing didn't apply to them.\n\nThe only time we'll be going back to Christoper's is when its closing for good to mock the owner as he locks the door one last time. Until then, this place can kiss my lily white ass."""""""
4	Caveat: You totally gotta be in the mood for this place, and by in the mood I mean ready to fight the crowds, scream your conversations, and miss three-quarters of what your friend just said. However, the always-entertaining people watching, endless foo-foo drink menu, and give-a-shit atmosphere helps counteract that. Eye candy for everyone, really, and I love watching the outfits and makeup people pull off.\n\nI think the staff is pretty friendly, and I'm so not a 21-year-old, totally built gay dude. We went there during Pride, and there was a $3 Smirnoff special going on. So I screamed my order to one of the cute bartenders who somehow misheard it and made two vodka-crans instead of one. No problem for me, as it actually would save me another trip to the bar, but the little cutie was actually embarrassed and wouldn't let me pay for both... and when I tried to leave him a fat tip he actually tossed it back at me. \n\nThe gross overconsumption of vodka led to the place of no return, the dance floor, where I embarrassed myself thoroughly with my shiteous white girl dancing. At Amsterdam, though, nobody gives a shit. That's pretty cool. The uber-techno remixes of Ke$ha songs I've never heard do get old, but hell, it's part of the scene. \n\nSo, in summary, a super fun place to hit up when you're in the mood to  hang out, get shitty, and let your freak flag fly without people giving you the snotty up-and-down look. Hell, we even ended up dancing here one night when we'd gone out right after work, and no one looked twice at a bunch of losers in scrubs. Nowhere else do you get that! Love.
5	"""Love, love, love Wildflower! It's the type of place to consistently get a fantastic breakfast or lunch. The bread is scrumptious, the desserts fantastic, and the salads to die for.\n\nMy standard order for lunch is the Chopped Salad with nine grain bread. I love that you can pick what type of bread comes with your salad. The salmon is always perfectly cooked, and the couscous and dried cranberries really add something extra. For breakfast, I usually go with the Roasted Tomato Feta & Egg Sandwich, which comes on ciabatta bread, or the Feta & Roasted Vegetable Frittata. The breakfast sandwich is one of the best I've ever had.\n\nThey offer two custom iced teas: passion fruit and green tea with guava. Both are delicious. The small drink size is really small, so I typically get a medium even when I dine in.\n\nYes, it gets busy. Between noon and 1 there is an influx of people from the local offices on their lunch hour. Many people also use the dining area for \working lunches.\"""" There are outlets on the bottom of each of the booths, making it great for working on your laptop. If you choose one of these peak times, watch out for table hawks. You know the ones who hover over your table and swoop in to claim their territory. It also makes navigating the maze to the drink station quite a challenge.\n\nParking can be a challenge, but if you don't mind a little extra walk it's less crazy to park farther away. Wildflower is tucked away in the back corner of a U shaped part of the shopping center at Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101.\n\nThe outdoor seating is really quite pleasant, and a great place to bring your pup. On multiple occasions, one of the kind staffers has brought out a water bowl. You can also just ask for a soup bowl when you order. I love the cute umbrellas they added recently! Really helps on the sweltering summer days."""""""
3	OK. I'm a CenPho snob. A yelp elitist. I admit it. I own it. So when I found out I was going to Peoria for an event, I had already formed my opinion. Cheesey place with cheesey people. God, I love being right! This place is HUGE. Over 14,500 square feet of restaurant, bar, stage and patio space. The event was very disorganized and it was difficult getting a server. I can't knock the restaurant so much for this. And I'll yelp the event seperately. It seems as thoug the food du jour at restaurants everywhere is an upscale macaroni and cheese. And SKYE serves there's with chunks of lobster. Dee lish. Of course you could serve mac n cheese with human toes and I'd still scrape the plate with my fingers. The steak sticks were like skewers of shoe leather. Only leather would have been tastier. The calamari was crisp and tender served with sweet and sour and marinara sauces. Rickie's filet was devoured in seconds. So I'm assuming thumbs up on that. I wasn't feeling the pinot grigio so I switched to chilled Patron and Coronas. Seemed like a good idea at the time. Probably should have stopped drinking before midnight. But. I didn't. I guess if you live out here, this could be a happening place. It just ain't happening for me.
5	Have enjoyed every dish I've ordered ..been here at least 3 times (and once to the Scottsdale Quarter location) and have, each time, ordered something different (so many intriguing options I can't help it but want to try a new thing! PLUS, they change their menu items with a few staples that remain unchanged).  \n\nI've never tried their pizzas, but I can attest to their salads and sandwiches and entrees - the one that stands out the most is their Sashimi Tuna which was surprisingly filling (the fat of the fish and avocado) and not-surprisingly, very full of flavor and my favorite, ginger.  Their Steak Tacos were also fantastic and I love the cotija cheese they put on top and of course my other fave, avocado.\n\nTheir price point is competitive considering they serve premium ingredients and the food has never disappointed.  Also, servers are (cute enough), wearing matching capris and such and have always been friendly, down to earth, and prompt.\n\nI enjoyed the outdoor patio that the Scottsdale Quarter location has better than the Biltmore's, but this place is still very enjoyable... I just hate the parking dilemma since it's so popular on a any night of the week.
4	Home to the Mariners and Padres Spring Facilities, Peoria Sports Complex is a pretty great place to take in the action. I have seen a decent number of games here over the years. Most recently I saw a weekend game sitting out on the lawn. It does not get much better than relaxing on the lawn, watching some baseball, hanging out with your friends, and getting some color in the 80 degree heat. \n\nThe practical details: (1) there are a TON of food options. Maybe too many, if you believe in such a thing. Food of all kinds is everywhere. You can get all the standard ball park fare and some more exotic things, too, like noodle dishes, sushi, fry bread, etc. (2) Ticket prices are good - sit up close for 20 bucks on down to the lawn for 6 bucks. You can't beat it for getting up close to the action (3) Parking is only 5 bucks in the lot, which I think is really decent, but if you want to walk a little further you could find street parking across the street.\n\nBEST DEAL IN THE PARK: $9 for a 32oz. soda with unlimited refills. A large one is $5 and not as big, so if you get even two this is a great deal. On the hot day I was there we filled the sucker up three times and once more before we left. Well worth it.\n\nIn short, if you're doing the Spring Training thing definitely come to Peoria. It's super relaxed and one of the best places to enjoy some baseball. You will want to keep coming back!
2	"""i almost died of dehydration...water, water everywhere, and not an attentive server in sight. i blame this on howard B. who could not get his A in gear. i guess the fact that my party of one waiting to double proved to puzzle the pita peddlers, one asked me if i had been helped and i said no, but i was waiting for someone... so no rush...she asked if i would like a drink and i said i would love an iced tea. it must have been a survey because she never came back. i chatted with the ducks for awhile, evidently people in chandler do not talk to ducks, i think that is speciesist, but understandable because i eventually grew tired of their complaining about obamacare and intellectual property laws..i decided that i wanted to eat them, luckily howard arrived to talk me out of it. yay service...\n\nno, not yet. only when I exclaimed \what is going on here?\"""" in reference to something typically unsavory, did our hot pants waitress take notice. being loud does pay....blue corn nachos and lavosh shawarma subbing out the greek salad for taboule of course. i love taboule and pita jungle does it well so one star for the taboule. the blue corn nachos were meh (sorry howard) but the ducks enjoyed them. there is a woman who works here who takes a bit of enjoyment from scaring the ducks away by whipping a blue cloth at them, and hey...not so nice lady. ducks love chicken..did you know? this bothers me a little but makes me happy to like chicken as well. so the the other star is for the ducks. to the lady who scares the ducks...i got a warm tingle in my heart when you stepped in the duck poo. quack"""""""
5	"""Sportsman's is on top of the game when it comes to wine! The staff is more knowledgeable and helpful than any other place that I have bought wine at before. I didn't feel like I was being judged for trying to find a cheaper bottle and there was no pretentiousness in the air. While I was inquiring about dry resling, one of the vino gurus offered to get me a taste of one from their bar - and came back with TWO samples for me to try! \n\nSportsman's also has a very intriguing liquor section - I enjoy wandering around and looking at all the fabulous bottles I have never seen nor heard of. \n\nSeveral times a month, they offer complimentary wine tastings and special discounts on most of the bottles being sampled.  They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge \by the glass\"""" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!  \n\nThe portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them! \n\nMy one complaint is petty: their website.  Its overrun with text and finding important information is difficult, it also needs to be better updated with their amazing tasting events!"""""""
4	"""Nom nom nom! I am a FAN! Damn, that was good. I ordered the \granola healthcakes with blueberries and strawberries\"""" and they were deee-lisshh! I highly enjoyed my meal, however the server was a bit hard to find when we needed something, but thats okay. The granola healthcakes, as they call them, were a bit different then what I was expecting too but they were still good none the less. My fiance ordered the Southwest Carnitas skillet, and it was good but HOLY GREASE. Just a tad too much grease for the both of us, he had to stop eating it because the grease was horrible. All in all, I will definitely be back and I recommend you do so too if you're in the area."""""""
5	It appears as if my first review of this fine establishment was pushing the envelope a bit, so allow me to reintroduce my opinion of one of my favorite places to dine in this city. \n\nMatt Pool and his breakfast restaurant have received national critical acclaim for their use of local, fresh, organic ingredients and their simple traditional preparation of American breakfast classics. \n\nThe number one complaint I encounter about this restaurant is the wait. Of course there's a wait, it's probably the most famous breakfast joint in this state, and there's a reason people flock to it 6 days a week: because its really good food served by a really good staff. I'm sure that the people who complain about the wait here are the same people who complain about the wait at Pizzeria Bianco. \n\nTo all of those people, I pose this question to you: since when has dining out in America become this rush to get in, stuff your gullet and get out as fast as possible? Why is dining in this country no longer about the experience and the socialization you get with your fellow diners? Why not come downtown, sign up for a table, and then stroll down to Fair Trade for a latte while you wait, or take a nice walk around and see what the Roosevelt district has to offer? We're always in such a hurry...I say it's nice to slow down, spend some time with our friends and family and nosh on a breakfast that is totally worth the wait. I believe that many restaurants have spoiled the average American consumer with instant gratification--how many times have you refused to wait at a restaurant because the wait was 30+ minutes? We want good food, and we want it now, screw everyone else, and if you can't feed our bellies within 30 minutes, we'll take our business somewhere else. This attitude is crap. \n\nYou have to slow down and appreciate how hard this little restaurant works. Matt's wife is there 6 days a week to ensure that their business is performing at the level at which it should. The kitchen staff is there from 6:00 am to almost 4pm sometimes churning out thousands of plates of fried eggs, thick peppered bacon, hash browns, home fries, pancakes, pork chops, burgers...The point is, a lot of love and thought has gone into this restaurant to make sure that every single ingredient put on your plate is of the highest quality possible and is prepared by a very talented kitchen staff. \n\nIt is a small restaurant, but it's always warm and inviting, and the coffee is always hot and fresh and they might not serve you a huge glass of orange juice, but it's always 100% fresh, squeezed that morning by the staff. \n\nAfter my plea to try and understand the other side of this restaurant, I know that I may not have been able to make everyone stop and reconsider any opinions they might have about this place: the wait, the small serving of orange juice, the confined areas, and that's OK. All I'm saying is that this place is an institution in downtown dining...and it's really nice to go an experience the food, the service and the though that goes into running this business if only every once in a blue moon. And if not, that's OK, because there are plenty of people who will gladly take your place in line.
5	For a tanning salon, Darque Tan on Scottsdale and Shea gets top marks. Recently, I decided that although summer was over, my healthy summer glow didn't have to disappear. A friend recommended Darque Tan, and I went in for some information. Let me tell you, I have tanned countless times before, at countless salons NEVER have I received such excellent service from such a friendly, patient and knowledgeable staff member. Usually, tanning salons are staffed with high school girls looking for some extra cash for the weekend who are not at all interested in being overly helpful if it takes them away from texting at the counter. NOT my experience in this case though. The employee walked me through a very thorough explanation of their membership pricing and options, pointing out various deals and discounts along the way. She gave me a full tour of the property and patiently answered all of my questions (and I had PLENTY - if I'm going to spend approx. $80/month for a tanning membership it better be worth it!). She then walked me through the various tanning lotions provided, breaking them down by cost, level of bronzing, even smell! \n\nOn top of the excellent service I received, I also have to rave about the facility itself. Darque Tan may be more expensive than other tanning salons around (although packages CAN run from $22/$48 month with upgrade options), but their beds are well worth the extra cash. They offer level 1 - level 5 beds, stand up beds, beds with misters and multiple fans, spray tanning, etc. ALL beds are nice, comfortable, and new. Even with the lowest package available, you're still going to get a nice bed - and you never run the risk of getting put in the crap bed that 's been there since 1984. \n\nLets see, what else....There are no appointments required, and they always have plenty of beds available to walk in. They have several locations in the valley, and your membership is valid at all of them. There are no contracts to sign. If you pay for a package, your package stays till you use it (no expiration date) even if you quit your membership. \n\nBasically, this place is awesome. I'm a fan!
4	I went here not knowing what to expect. I didn't know if I would be able to find anything. I was hoping hoping hoping I would find a little treasure. \n\nWhen I walked in i was warmly greeted. \n\nI ended up buying a few roadrunners because I collect them. Ok I bought like 5. \n\nThe woman was very friendly and she even gave me suggestions for other stores. \n\nUnfortunately I did not see any Jesus hates it when you smoke ashtrays because I definitely would have bought one.
5	Thank you to Yelper reviews and your high ratings for M. Giambrone. Mike is very passionate and took the time to thoroughly go through the services that Legal Shield offers. One of my R.N. employees works as a Rep and had great feedback. I wanted to contact someone who was in my area. I choose the basic membership and so far will be utilizing their services for a couple of things. Rental and legal action with mechanic services that was not done and was found by a reputable company. I will update my review once I have used Legal Shield for these two things. Mike has been a tremendous help with referring me to other companies/contacts for needs for my place. Mike's a really good guy that you want on your side!  : )
3	We came here a month ago.  We came right before lunch started.  There was a breakfast buffet going on with only 2 guests inside the restaurant.  Hostess wouldn't sit us until buffet was cleared.  Kind of annoying, but fine, whatever.\nAs for food, we got the free guacamole by checking in and it was really delicious.  Husband raved about his Pozole soup.  He still raves about it today!  So must be good :)  I THINK i got the carne asado tacos.  It was not memorable at all.  I just remember it drenched in oil and cheese.  I would go back and try other things on the menu though!
5	Tuning Gruppe is a great performance and maintenance shop. No job is too big or too small. I had a promblem with my timing belt and it was fixed asap for a competetive price. Eric was friendly and didnt try to up sell me or add stuff on that wasnt needed but did inform me of stuff to watch out for in the future. they specialize in european cars (vw, audi, bmw, benz, porsche, etc) but i even saw a few american and japanese cars getting work done while i was there. dont let the small shop fool you, these guys do amazing work!
2	I've been a somewhat regular customer here for 3+ years. I've been eating at places like this for 20+ years. I can see the impact the economy has had on this place. It's been slowly getting worse everytime I visit. Last night was a joke though. No bartender to make mixed drinks. They were out of Bacardi and Captain Morgan. Who doesn't have a bartender and popular alcohol on a Saturday night? Oh well, lets move onto the food. The food was not very good at all. I was surprised because it's usually decent. The filet was not good meat and the lobster was dry. The cook forgot to bring enough rice to the table, he forgot chicken, and not enough cooking supplies. He would keep asking the server to bring him these items asap. I don't see myself ever going back. The total was over $100 for 2 people. For that kinda money I expect good service and good food. Anyone that thinks this place has good sushi, has never really experienced what good sushi is like. I would compare it to the sushi I can buy at Fry's grocery store.
4	"""we came here for their NYE party at Stone Rose Lounge. unless you had VIP or reserved a table (for i'm sure an exorbitant price) we were regaled with the other 99% to standing under one of many of their outdoor heat lamps. it was cold so i pretty much had to keep my jacket on the whole night. my wife, the better of us two, toughed it out by showing off her lovely dress and heels...me? i just cowered under the heat lamp. \nthe bar staff was quick and polite. one of my beers had a skunky taste, so i returned and they were quick to offer me another option. there were 2 bars, one outside, one inside. the dance floor was packed with bad dancers until i showed up and started busting my \bite-lower-lip\"""" moves. the music was very good for the party. of note, i was expecting a more upscale crowd, but there were many drunken scottsdale folks and plenty of skirts so short, butt cheeks were hanging out. \nthe hotel itself is beautiful and all the valet/hotel staff are impeccably dressed and acted accordingly. if i could afford a real stay here, i most certainly would.\nNYE ticket prices were the cheapest we could find...only 25 bucks per person (again, standing room or bar only...no tables)."""""""
3	Excited I remembered that this place opened soon, I stopped in for Indian 'fast-food'.  I ordered Chole with 1/2 rice portion, 1/2 naan.  The gentleman who took my order forgot to give me my change and after I told him, he gave me my dollar back in dimes. I waited approx. 15 minutes for my 'fast-food'.  The Chole was OK, the rice was rice and the naan was great.  Like the first reviewer, I didn't think the value was that great.  I'm no pig but even I could've had more.  When I go back I'll have to get the big plate (full serving of rice & whole piece of naan) but then we're talking $9+.  A bit much for fast-food.  I will go back, though.  They just opened and I don't want a food option like this to go away without a chance.
2	"""OK I know I am going to get flack for this but here goes. Are you freaking kidding me, no tarter?!? \n\nOn the advise of Abu whose taste buds have now come into question, I tried Pete's yesterday. I trekked out in what felt like 500 degree heat to the ATM. Because Pete has not stepped into the 21st century yet! \n\nThe whole time I am thinking if they are still in business after no tarter and no debit it must be good, right? Wrong. I have been tricked, hoodwinked, bamboozled, led a stray, run a muck. Just flat out deceived! \n\nI ordered the deluxe seafood combo 2 pieces of fish, 7 shrimp, fries and a 32 oz drink. Which by the way did not have its price listed. I figured it couldn't be to much the regular combo has 1 less piece of fish and 3 less shrimp was only 5.95. Wrong again $9.45! Again thinking this fish must be outstanding! \n\nI get it home and it was still piping hot and smelled wonderful! Again with the trickery. I started with a french fry and it wasn't completely done in the middle yuck! I then moved onto what Pete describes as shrimp, really there was shrimp in there? I never tasted it and only saw some small specks of white and red inside the gross grease laden dough! UGH I had to spit it out. Even my dog left it and she has been known to eat her own poop! \n\nThe only reason Pete's did not rate a 1 star from me is the square fish. Yes I said square, it is a square patty just like McDonald's only it does taste better than Mickey D's. I didn't care for the red sauce on my fish. The 1st piece I ate plain and the second piece I added my own tarter sauce and it was delicious. On a sidebar some of the other fries were edible and pretty tasty. \n\nI have yet to find a joint that can top the catfish at Honey Bears but not for lack of trying. \n\nMoral of this story, only get the fish and chips, make sure your chips are cooked and have tarter on the ready!\n\nAlso Lain gave me this tid bit of info... \Pete the owner was murdered as he slept, they used a hammer and bashed his head in, just some trivia for you...\""""\n\nYeah they bashed his head in over that shrimp and no tarter sauce!"""""""

After putting our names down we had wine, beer and crostini from bar bianco.\nI was really amazed there weren't any hot heads complaining about the wait.  Everyone was pretty chill and mellow. I loved the atmosphere !\nThe 2.5 hour wait went by pretty fast. \n\nAnyways, definitely worth a stop if you have the time in Phoenix.  We had the tomato with mozzerlla, basil and olive oil. YUM!!!  We had another dish with prosciutto wrapped around cheese on skewers or somehing.   It was good, though it was too cheesey for me.  We ordered the margherita pizza, but we added garlic and salami (db wanted to add the salami).  I just removed the salami, but the pizza was sooooooooooo delish!!!  Totally worth the wait, but that's me. Service was spot on! The staff was so friendly and my water always full. \n\nI never thought I'd wait 2.5 hours to eat pizza, EVAR.

4	Work took me to the Clarendon twice in the span of four days... you better believe I ate lunch and enjoyed happy hour at Gallo Blanco on both occasions.  That includes the Monday special, a $20 pitcher of margaritas that I may or may not have shared with someone else.  Seriously, how could Monday get any better?  I wish somebody would hand me a pitcher of margaritas at the end of every Monday.  \n\nAs far as the menu goes, everything is good.  Just close your eyes and point.  I only have one warning, avoid the cheese crisp as an actual meal.  It is just one flat piece of burned cheese.  One of the poor girls I was working with on Monday ordered it for her lunch.  You could say she ended up ordering some sides to go with it.  It's not bad, but definitely a disappointment if you expected it to be satisfying in any way.
4	"""200 local artists are represented in this quirky, unique shop located off-the-beaten-track in a shopping mall located where N. Scottsdale Blvd. intersects Hwy 101.

This store reminded me of a Santa Cruz street art faire (if the theme was desert!).  The prices were good, the items unique.

3	Mmmmmmm, breakfast!  Enjoyed a nice skillet (Pueblo, I think it was - something southwestern) and a few bites of a buttermilk pancake.  All was yum in my tum.  My friend had a wheat pancake with straw- and blueberries, and she said it was the best one she'd ever had.  She's kind of a picky eater, so that's pretty good testimonial there.   It's a cute little local chain breakfast eatery.  Have to round down to 3 stars for the pokey service, though.

3	I love Indian cuisine and this place is awesome because everything is Vegan or Vegetarian. A friend and I walked in and ordered to go. It was pretty busy and the menu offered a wide variety. I didn't recognize the names of the dishes so the host helped to explain the dishes and that there were different regions of Indian cuisine. We ordered: \n\n*-Vegetable Samosas- mmmmmm so yummy, stuffed with potatoes, onions, and peas. I     liked it dunked in the yogurt sauce.\n*-Poori- Indian bread, this was good with the chutney but it was a little crispy for me since I'm used to eating naan.\n*-Mango Chutney- Sweet and spicy, huge chunks of mango.\n*-Vegetable Curry- The flavor was perfect, spicy but not too spicy, lots of veggies.\n*-Extra rice...\n\nOverall, it was pretty good. I think that it was a little pricey for the amount of food you get. I would go back to try the lunch buffet since you get to try a variety of things for a better price.
4	Great place for folks who enjoy Vietnamese cuisine and also their friends that just partake of American food.\n\nThe staff is fun and the remodel was tastfully executed.  \n\nSo if you are out for some drinks and Pho you are in for a treat.  The sliders, dumplings and eggrolls are great for the not-so-adventurous eaters in your party.\nAt night this is an upscale bar with nice decor.  I love having it as a walkable option for me.  Its the nicest place for happy hour food and drinks in the area.\n\nCome and check it out!
5	THE only go-to Chinese place in the valley.  Really, everything thing about this place is wonderful. \n\nEvery bit, of every chicken dish I have had here has been tender white and the good parts of the dark meat and so fresh the little boxes will honestly get a little too hot to handle at first.  The rice is always fresh tasting and stores so well, its unbelievable. The people are friendly and we (the wife and I) have never once been disappointed.\n\nLove ^_^
5	"""I love RHR!  I found it by accident after a great day at Halo, and really didn't \get it\"""".  I know there's a market for art toys, but never saw myself as a collector until I had my hands on a few.  When I saw the Christmas Smorkin' Labbit collection, I knew I had to have it (yep, that was me that got the last one!)  Although I'm no big spender, RHR is now a regular stop for me after work, after Halo, or just because.  It's great that, despite being an adult oriented store (not THAT way, although that's what I expected to find), I can pick up a few things for our daughter too.  Check it out; you won't find anything else like it in Phoenix!\nUpdate:\nI can't tell you how sad I was when RHR went out of business.  I had hoped that the move would be a good thing, but honestly the new location didn't seem nearly as attractive as the old one (which is why I made a special effort to continue to shop there!)  I certainly don't know the back story, but I do know that the day RHR closed its doors Phoenix lost an irreplaceable icon. \n:''''("""""""
4	This place is in Scottsdale, not PV.\n23587 North Scottsdale Road\nScottsdale, Arizona 85255\nhttp://www.jalapenosscottsdale.com/index.html\n\nGreat place. Tell them it's your first time and they'll bring you their signature Best of Phoenix Sweet Corn Tamale. So good!\n\nHH- 1/2 off appetizers, 2.50 domestics, 3.50 imports, 3.50 signature margarita. \n\nMy wife and I had their delicious chips and salsa then split the mexican pizza. It was way too big to finish! We were bummed that we were too full try try an entree so we'll have to give this place another try soon.\n\n-S.
5	Scottsdale stadium is the best park in the Cactus League, and as a Cubs fan, I wish that we would have a 7 game series vs these wankers for the right to use this stadium.  \n\nIts proximity to the best day-drinking spots anywhere in the Valley is the primary reason to come to this particular stadium, because, well, who wants to see the Giants anyway?\n\nThe second best reason is that they import Bay Area-comforts like Anchor Steam, Pale Ale, and Northern Cali junk food.  \n\nThe grass berm in the outfield is short, but if you can snag a spot, its fantastic for sightlines.
4	Having been here multiple times, we are not quite sure why we haven't written a review yet.  \n   This is becoming a trusted standy by when we want a tasty meal,to be  taken care of by great people, served solid drinks, and enjoy a great atmosphere.\n   I think they have the best house margarita around and the El Padre is another favorite of mine.  \n   Don't think we have had the same meal twice since we started going.  Have enjoyed ever dish we have tried.  I had the fish tacos( perfectly done) and the mrs. enjoyed the shrimp fajitas on our last visit.  Try the Clams Corona...very tasty.  The short ribs are awesome also.\n\n   All the normal Mexican fare is here, but so much tastier ( Tia's Enchiladas &modern burrito).  \n\nSeems like it is pretty busy most of the time, but we seem to find a spot in the bar somewhere...that is the best place anyways!
1	"""This is one of those companies that specializes in service via \annual contracts.\"""" Get your wallet out . . . dealing with Empire is extremely pricey.\n\nWe made the mistake of calling Empire when our air conditioner broke. Being new to the area, we didn't have any local contacts and just used the yellow pages. When the Empire guys came, they found out what was wrong and replaced a small part that I later found was something like $60 or $70 when ordered on the Internet. But for some reason, by the time they added their service fee for the appx 20  minute appointment, it was considerably over $600. Then, they try to get you to buy an annual contract so that you can get two \""""free\"""" tuneups. All in all, I wouldn't trust these people to come back to my house EVER.

2	As much as I'd like to root for the underdog in an ever-expanding world of franchise dominancy, today has been the last straw. I felt I had a connection with Jason's reuben sandwich, first few times piled high with corned beef and a good proportion to sauerkraut. I even looked the other way when I was charged an extra $2 for them to do half corned beef/half pastrami (I got the same amount of meat). I still had faith in them. Then came the last few visits when the service became senile-slow and the food quality atrocious. I'd give it one last chance today and it was indeed the final rusty nail in my shabby coffin. Apparently I ordered an $8 sauerkraut sandwich called The Reuben; with a sliver of corned beef and a mountain of sauerkraut, it was everything my liberal vegetarianism craved. \n\nPeople of the jury, allow me to present Exhibit A...

1	"""If you're visiting Pearl for a low cost and decent quality sushi, be prepared for the horrible customer service that comes with it. For starters the food is not \great\"""" and the prices definitely fit the quality of it's food. As a resident of PHX we have visited Pearl on several occasions. However, every time we have visited, we have had a horrible experience with the staff and owner. We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well. She claims to be an owner of Sushi bars for over 18 years but it is VERY apparent that she lacks the education of hospitality. We officially stopped attending and have spread the word of her horrible management.  For a little more money I would definitely recommend RAW sushi or Stingray."""""""
3	We went to SunUp last week Saturday for lunch. We were excited to try the beers on tap, especially the cream ale. One of my favorite beers, Spotted Cow (sold only in Wisconsin), is a cream ale so I was looking forward to hopefully finding something similar. Unfortunately, they were out! Bummer.\n\nWe got their sampler, which for $6.50 included six 4-ounce beers. We had the vanilla porter (VERY vanilla tasting!), nut brown (very good), pale ale (hoppy and floral), amber ale (malty, my favorite), hefeweizen (a good basic wheat beer) and a red ale (good blend of malt and hops, my husbands favorite). \n\nFor lunch, my husband had the beer brat and a side of macaroni and cheese. He really enjoyed both. I had the Ruben and garlic Parmesan fries. I liked them both, but there was very little meat on the sandwich, especially for $8.50. The Parmesan cheese on top of the fries is the dry, kraft-kind of cheese, just FYI. \n\nOverall, a good brew pub, but Four Peaks steals my heart!
5	"""If I could live off of Postino's Bruchetta Board I would. Actually now that I think about it that isn't a bad idea. The only downside of loving something so much is that I hardly venture out and trying something else on the menu. I think my favorite is the red peppers - I don't know how they get so much good flavor in a tiny little piece. \n\nThe only other thing I have had their is what I call the \magic sandwhich.\"""" Also known as the chicken and mozzarella panin but I sub the mayo for a pesto sauce. Yum Yum Yum!\n\nPlus they have an amazing selection of drinks and a great happy hour (if only it went a little longer in the afternoon it would be perfection)."""""""
4	Quick update: Stopped by the past weekend. The claypot chili wings are top notch. Some of the best wings I have ever eaten. A solid choice. \n\nLooks like a good addition to the Bethany Home & 16th St area. Really cool renovation of an old mechanic's shop. Slide up garage doors and fold up windows give the place a really open air feeling. \n\nOn to the food! The menu is pretty sparse, but covers the standard pub type fare. Salads, flatbreads (pizza), wings, burgers, etc...\n\nWe had an order of deviled eggs to start the night. Yea, never seen them on a menu before either. They were good, but a bit tame. They could be spiced up a bit for my taste. For dinner, I had a bacon cheeseburger. The bun was super tasty. Brioche bread and toasted a bit. \n\nBeer and wine list was lengthy and reasonably priced.\n\nI would return and would recommend.
5	I can't say that I would fight for a parking space at many places, but Postino makes the list. Will I ever steal a parking spot? Not at all, but I will look long and hard for one here. The wait is worth it yelp friends. Postino does a great job luring customers in and keeping them. With their incredible happy hour, I wish I could sneak away to dine on a glass of wine before 4:00 PM on a weekday and for those who can, I salute you. \n\nEvery time I wine and dine at Postino, I leave full, happy and satisfied. The original Postino location will also be my favorite based on it's location, ambiance, character, service and quality products. The wine is obviously top knotch here at Postino. Bottles line the walls and the staff knows their selections inside and out. They offer bottle specials all the time and you can enjoy a bottle at a reasonable price practically every day of the week. \n\nTheir food competes with the quality of their wine. I long for their bruschetta. You chose four different flavors and for a reasonable price under $15. My favorite bruschettas are the prosciutto and fig, and tomato paste with cheese. The tomato mozzarella is also a classic. But, it really just depends on your taste buds because any bruschetta you choose will be excellent. Many times, I got for the half sandwich/salad combo. I like to order the Market which isn't on the menu. It comes with pesto, tomato and mozzerela. I make sure to add chicken. The Mediterranean is my go-to salad but I vary between all of their salads. You really just can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. And it tastes even better with wine. Doesn't everything?
3	So my last meal in Phoenix was at Switch with a friend. I'd rather switch back to eating at Ticoz and Fez but that is because I had high expectations for this place. \n\nWe went around 10:00pm and it was pretty empty, mostly people starting their Saturday nights. They were playing techno remixes of Britney Spears and M.I.A., which seemed  rather odd considering how laid back the vibe was at this time.\n\nI ordered the drunken Italian soda which was huge, more like a double but it was delicious and a genius idea. Of course I order the perfect summer drink on the rare night it dips into the 50s in October. \n\nOur sandwiches came out fast, which was nice since we didn't order appetizers. I ordered the lobster roll, a combo of lobster and seafood (think tuna salad) with corn and onions. It was delicious and the perfect amount of food. My only complaint with it was it was a little too wet.  I chose the citrus rice side, which was a little on the bland side. My friend ordered the fries, which were thickly cut and delicious and I wish I had ordered those instead.\n\nOverall Switch is a beautiful restaurant with an upscale yet relaxed atmosphere, perfect for late night dining.  If Fez and Ticoz had a baby this would be their offspring. Unfortunately I like it's parents a little more.
1	"""I was in the area and saw a coffee shop, so I stopped by for a quick cup. Well, that was difficult. I wish I had beforehand seen all of the fake 4/5-star reviews here and headed elsewhere.\n\nIn short:\nEverything will likely be broken.\nYou're not allowed to make any changes to your beverage, because the place is run by a bunch of pretentious ninnies who believe their product is the epitome of.. whatever it is that they are attempting to do (the word \swindle\"""" comes to mind).\nOh, and the end result will be mediocre.\n\nHead elsewhere. Do not be swayed by their interesting-looking wooden sign. The inner design is nice, however.

5	I am from a small town just south of a big town. I have had plenty of hamburgers in my day believe you me. However, nothing will ever enter my mouth the same way as the Vesuious burger did. It was an epic explosion of flavor that titillated every single one of my taste buds. And don't get me started on the staff. So helpful! Especially (I believe her name was??) Whitney. She helped me out not only with my burger choice but also my life. I want to be a better man because of her. If girls could be boy scouts she should get a badge for awesomeness.

3	A decent place to get sushi in Glendale. I came for lunch with my parents and some family friends. They all ordered non-sushi dishes, but I opted to get two rolls. I had a spicy tuna and the Be roll, which is the daily chef's special. Both were very good and a had eight pieces per roll I believe. We also shared a platter of sashimi, which was pretty good.\n\nThe decor is very modern and it looks like a nice place to meet for drinks. They were totally playing some ghetto fab music though. Oh yeah, it goes so well with the sushi. Maybe too hip to bring your parents here. My parents through, they're down fo' wuteva. ;P
4	Good mexican food in a northern scottsdale?  oxymoron. \n\nBut seriously, not bad.  Definitely not half as good as the mexican travel trailer stomach-ache-for-weeks food, but certainly better quality.  To start, our server was absolutely fantastic, bringing chips and salsa right away and making great suggestions.  Being new to the joint, we had no idea what to order with the humongous menu, so he kindly pointed us in the right direction. \n\nPretty good (and pretty strong :):):)  margaritas to start with, though i'd opt next time for rocks vs frozen (super icy - good if thats your style).  My guy took our waiters word and got the pollo fundito --- AMAZING.  ridiculous flavor but not overdone at all, certainly would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  I unfortunately was indecisive as usual, so i went for the choose two, going with the steak tacos and chicken flautas.  Pretty good, pretty fresh, but honestly nothing super special and kinda lacked in flavor.  \n\nGood portions, fresh food, great service, and comfortable atmosphere.  I'll be goijng back, but i'll be sticking to the specials.
4	Every once in a while you just need some good Indian food to spice things up... on those days we always go to Jewel of Crown.  When you walk in you get hit hard by the lovely aromas of Indian spices... reminds you why you came!  We've probably been there 5-6 times this year and it has never been busy. It's kind of sad actually. They have a nice vegetarian selection; my favorite is Malai Kofta... which is veggie meatballs in Masala sauce!  I have also tried Saag Paneer and Bharta Makhni which were also excellent.  My Bf is also in love with the Chicken Masala... and Raita.   We typically order our food with medium spice because we like a bit of kick to the palate!  If you aren't used to Indian or spicy food, I would order medium-mild so you can enjoy the flavors before you decide to kick it up a notch.   Please give Jewel of Crown a try, it's my favorite Indian restaurant and I'm afraid it will go under if business doesn't pick up.... Oh yeah, and you'll enjoy it!
1	I had a sub and since in the name of the restaurant it says sub's I figured it was ok to order... Boy was I wrong!!! The meat is not sliced there, it is slimy packaged meat!!! Nasty!  If you are going to open a restaurant where you serve sandwiches, don't you think it would be a good investment to buy a meat slicer and the meat?  I almost threw up, I could not even swallow it, I spit it out, a waist of $8!
5	The architecture is just as pleasurable as the art. The building is almost like a playground trying to explore all the floors.  The museum does a great job of representing a diverse collection especially for Phoenix being such a young city compared to the east coast.\n\nThere is a fair mix of Contemporary, European, Southwest, and traveling exhibitions.  My favorites right now are: \n\nMass by Cornelia Parker\nChuck Close's portrait tapestry \nYou Who are getting Obliterated in the Dancing Swarm of Fireflies by Yayoi Kusama.\n\nWednesday nights are also free (voluntary donation) from 3-9pm [Courtesy of SRP]\n\nAlso went Easter Sunday and got in for free as Bank of America let's their customers in for free the first FULL WEEKEND of the month.  Nice little perk.\n\nWould like to see more corporations and entrepreneurs donate to help the collection grow.  Hard to develop funds when so many people in the city have ties to the midwest or east coast then make their donations back east.\n\nDowntown is a great time to invest as it's growing by leaps and bounds right now.
4	This restaurant = a great experience. Everything about this place is fabulous. The server was extremely attentive, the food was fresh and delicious, and the intimate yet casual ambiance is to die for.\n\nENTREE\n\nFor starters, they do put a rather unique spin on the typical 'chips and salsa' that's brought out to you in the beginning of most Spanish restaurants. They bake corn tortillas until their crisp and serve that with an interesting array of dips: black bean, salsa, and a tray of salt, limes, and hot sauce to stir in.\n\nI ordered a simple entree of carne asada tacos and black beans; my meal was yummy and filling, and I even had leftovers. Beware of spicy when choosing your dish, however. My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was (beer battered fish burrito). I don't know if she has sensitive taste buds, or if it was really spicy.. so proceed with caution.\n\nDESSERT\n\nThey have a wide variety of entrees, but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options. I'm a BIG dessert person, so it was a little disappointing but what the heck. I ordered the flan and it was scrumptious, incredible, delectable, etc.. all that good stuff. My coworker who complained about the spiciness called our dessert 'sexy'. So I guess sexy is the best way to describe it's caramel drizzle and chocolate bark yumminess.\n\nAMBIANCE/SERVICE\n\nThe waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. He answered all questions we had, and gave speedy and praiseworthy service. The manager even came up to our table and made conversation; that, to me, is always a plus. The background music helped add to the overall appeal to the restaurant. \n\nI would definitely go back to SOL. Maybe tomorrow..
1	Tried this place because uh'hem it was reccomended. (Thanks Sarah) lol! We ordered take out the first time it was the worst ever looked like stuff fell on the floor. My kid had the roadies or w/e they were supposed to be like slider's there was 2 missing the meat! So we call to see what's up maybe they had an off night. The gm wanted to send us a gc for the meal ok....weeks go by we call her, again she apologizes. We finally get them and she had sent like 3x the original amount. YAY!\n\nWe decide to take some friends with us since it was FREE. Well once again it was pretty gross no one really ate much, 2 people got their filets they ended up well done. One was sent back and re-made. It ended up the same. They basically said if its later evening thats what your going to get no matter how you order them. The service is not so good and that makes 6 people never going there again, it's ok by me cuz I hate chain's. Will people ever learn chai's suck!?!? This place should not even get 1 star the best thing is the bucket's of peanut's. My daughter loved throwing the shells on the ground, I mean where else can your kid's do that on purpose?
4	"""Just a bit amazed that this one wasn't already listed, I mean its right next to Fashion Square, but that just means another Firsty for me!\n\nI \ran\"""" into Rada and roomies at this location earlier today. Seriously, total coincidence that I felt like going to Yogurtland, and just happened to find this trio walking the sidewalk! I must radiate friend-drawing energy, or something...\n\nWhat can I say, that hasn't been said about every Chipotle on the planet, besides that its a Chipotle. This location, like most others, decor is that sleek mix of light wood and metals, Mayan fixtures made of the same materials, clean and lacking the refection of the warmness of the food. As I munched on my burrito that I meant to take to go, we gabbed about the highlights of last night and showed off our pictures. \n\nOne of Rada's roomies asked if he could get a free refill, while the other was like, of course, Jebus is this like your first time? And oh my goodness it was. Chipotle-cherry broken and I can't even take credit for it! Anyways, you all know how nice I am, I add on in a serious voice, \n\""""Just one refill, only one!

4	3.5 stars.  The pool is a lot smaller than what the pictures show.  The nice thing is that they give you complimentary water as you sit on your chair.  The grounds are constantly in use by weddings or events.  All the workers there are pretty good looking, just not so outgoing or friendly.  The room is nice, we paid extra for a patio only to find a boring lounge chair and table outside.  \n\nThe front desk is very unhelpful.  If you ask to get your bill early or put a note on your room, they just tell you to ask again later.
3	our company christmas dinner was held here. we don't eat meat. but thought it would be fun to meet some of our co-workers and mingle.\n\nthis place was very cool. it's enormous inside and out. complete with wooden bridges, walkways suspended above the lower level, and even a slide! it has the redneck wood chips on the floor and the country music. even a real steer out front with huge horns. the interior is so cool with the real rock walls of south mountain incorporated into the restaurant. \n\nthe outdoor areas are primarily for large groups and i didn't disappoint. stunning evening views over the valley, replete with fire pits to stay warm. \n\nin the chow line, the steaks and ribs smelled awesome, but they were kind enough to cook us up a veggie burger, which was ok. here's where the 3 stars comes in....\n\nit was a VEGGIE burger!!!! although we didn't pay for a single thing, we looked at the menu and they charge 15.95 for an el cheapo veggie burger! holy cow (no pun intended). \n\ncool place to take the family if they pay for it.....
2	I went here based on the Yelp reviews and from recommendations from my husband's co-workers. I won't be returning. I was already skeptical about coming here because of the multiple Yelp reviews mentioning the security guard in the parking lot and the shady part of town that it's located in.  My husband and I got the shredded beef tacos and enchiladas. The shredded beef was so dry and overcooked that I only ate half my taco and was over it.  The beef enchilada was filled with huge chunks of beef, which were tender but lacking in flavor.  The rice and beans were nothing special.\n\noh yeah....  the chips they bring out when you arrive come with tiny bowls of salsa that you can barely dip your chips in because of how small and shallow the bowls are.
4	"""In addition to the name, which I love by the way, I really liked this place.  I went here with some coworkers after work for a couple of beers.  There were five of us, we each got an appetizer and each had two or more beers apiece and our tab was $50.  Not too bad for a couple hours of drinking on the patio.  They have a pretty decent selection of food and we all seemed to enjoy our fare (nothing special, just your typical bar food), and they offer mini pitchers of beer (I love that).\n\nMy only complaint is that they allow smoking on their patio.  It's just gross.  But, the patio is big enough that we just moved \upwind\"""" from the smokers and we were fine.  \n\nThis would be a great spot to go watch a couple of games on the patio in the gorgeous weather and have a few drinks.  I'll be back again."""""""
1	I'll be charitable - this place sucks!\n\nI went there because a friend had *exactly* the piece of furniture I needed and he got his from Ikea.   After wandering around the store forever, I finally found the right department.\n\nThe people working there were cold. uncaring. not helpful. no concept of customer service.  I left in disgust!\n\nCouple of days later, I was in Cost Plus World Market @ 18th St. & Camelback.  Voila!  I fould what I wanted - for close to the same price.  the BIG difference:  Warm smiles, friendly people, volunteered to go out of their way to help me.  Felt like I was among long-time friends!  They even delivered when they said they would.\n\nAnd, no need to drive half way to tucson and back!\n\nIkea?  Don't be foolish.  Cost Plus?  Now, there's a place that earned my repeat business!
4	Highly recommended! Rice Paper is not your hole-in-the-wall type Vietnamese restaurant. Its urban, chic, clean, modern...great for a date, business lunch, or fun with friends.\nThey specialize in hand rolls, not the deep fried kind, but wonderful fresh, light and tasty rice paper concoctions. We tried 3...a seared Ahi Tuna, a Shrimp and asparagus and a tempura soft-shell crab. All delicious. The vodka based Mandarin Ginger Fizz was a worthy cocktail accompaniment.\nFinished off with a large Ginger Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was sublime.\nHappy Hour is from 11 to 6:30 and its very busy at lunch. Fast, friendly service starts when one of the lovely owners greet you on arrival.\nMost tables are for two but there is a large communal table in the middle for a larger crowd. Nice bar area too.
4	Moving forward, you will probably be able to find me here every Sunday with my laptop day drinking to my hearts content. They have a fabulous patio with comfortable furniture and a relaxed vibe and one kick-ass mojito. I also REALLY enjoyed the chopped salad (veganized, of course).\n\nMy only complaint is that it is way too expensive. Hoping that they run some awesome weekend specials so I don't break the bank hanging out!\n\nOooooo just a quick update: BICYCLE DISCOUNT: Be Green! - Ride your bicycle to Local Breeze for Brunch and receive a 10% discount on your entire check.
3	Zoe's is a great place to go to when you dont want to cook dinner and you need something healthy.  I went there yesterday after the gym and ordered the chicken kabobs with extra salad.  Nothing really special about the actual meal, it is just chicken seasoned with some grilled veggies on a bed of salad.  One cool thing about this place is that you get a free small drink after 5pm when you order a dinner meal.  When I checked in on my iPhone I also received a 10% off my next meal there, so I will go back sometime soon.\n\nThe girl that helped me was really nice which is always a plus!
5	I've been to Upper Crust several times with my in-laws, and the food and service are always top notch.  I don't always have time to write reviews; however, something that Upper Crust did last week was so nice that I wanted to make sure to thank them for it.\n\nLast Monday was my birthday, and with a two year old and a six month old, eating out can be tricky.  My boys and I go out fairly often, but not for dinner (my husband prefers my cooking, how nice!).  My birthday fell on a Monday, and after working all day my husband just wanted to eat at home.  So he asked what I'd like for my birthday dinner, and I asked him to pick up pizza, wings and a salad from Upper Crust.  When the folks at Upper Crust found out it was my birthday, they included tiramisu (sp?) in the to-go bags, and it made my night.   Everything was delicious as always - the honey hot wings, the pizza, and the house salad, but it was so nice to include an enormous piece of tiramisu (perfect to share) and we did not ask for it.  THANK YOU Upper Crust, your consistency in providing not only excellent food but top of the line service will keep us coming back again and again.
5	To all of you Over- Easy haters. Get bent.  Honestly, if this place was so bad, why give it two stars instead of one? If you going to get all Office Space on somthin' , put your big-boy pants on and drop the friggen' hammer! Also don't write a review just because they were closed when you had a snack attack and it fizzed you.   This is A M E R I C A, not communist china  (YOU EAT EGG NOW!) the proprietors of this fine establishment can open and close as they see fit.\n\nAnd to finish, this place is the king, better than Matt's.  I like Matt's but it is Over Easy's bitch.  Squirell style.

Saw a review and thought they would be the best around. well they first said  \this is no problem give me a couple days and we will have it look like new.\"""" well after 8 DAYS of them saying \""""oh its on the table we will have it ready tomorrow\"""" i finally walked into the store and they had them ready. only problem is they didn't fix the problem. was completely upset and would never recommend them to anyone!!!"""""""
4	Went there for the first time today.  Excellent burger, and all the extra's on the burger are free which is pretty nice.  It was just over 10 bucks for a cheeseburger, regular fries, and large drink. The food was excellent.  I ding it down to 4 stars though, just because anything this good has to be unhealthy, and its definitely greasy.   The grease from the fries saturday my brown paper take-out bag.  They also squished the top of my bun pretty bad when wrapping it up in tin foil.  I'm guessing if you eat there, you don't have this problem as much.  Still, 4 stars for an excellent burger and fries place.  Definitely a step up over In-N-Out.
4	Stayed here for my best friends birthday. We just wanted a relaxing weekend and that's what we got. We liked that the pool was open 24-7. There was a bar at the pool but nobody attending it which blew. So we would have to go inside in our bathing suits to order our drinks since they didn't have a menu outside. People say the rooms are dated, but we thought they were nice. We enjoyed every part of our stay with the exception of the bar out by the pool not being open.(If theres a bar, someone should be working it right?)
2	"""Oh boy....where to begin?  Came here for a holiday party and couldn't wait to leave.  Tacky paint and decor is an understatement.  Picture National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation and the awful casino/restaurant Clark and Eddie go to.  Once we were inside a suggested an immediate trip to the bar to have a shot and kick this thing off.  $8.50 a shot for Patron.  Dinner was upstairs in their \banquet room\"""".  Yikes, more tacky paint and their holiday decor was a mixture of semi lit lights, branches of a fir tree, and plastic ornaments.  The food was actually edible and the comedy that was this experience is what earns it the second star.  Do yourself a favor and skip the bathroom.  I'm pretty sure it hasn't been cleaned in years and be careful in the parking lot as there are potholes throughout.  Good luck and remember some Pepto before you go to sleep."""""""
5	How can you go wrong with tortillas and pastries in one location?  I honestly don't understand how this little Mexican bakery stays in business  given everything is practically free. My hubby and I bought two empanadas for me (like a little pie or turnover), flan for him, a dozen tortillas, and 2 red burritos.  I guess you need to get there early because they were out of red tamales at 2 pm on a Friday.  \n\nThe empanadas were baked just to golden brown and the crust was so flaky and delicious words cannot describe it.  I had lemon and cherry, but I wanted to try one of everything.  The red chili in the burritos was mild but very flavorful.  Luckily they are wrapped in foil because I couldn't wait to get home to devour mine.  They could double their prices and I would still come back!\n\nI forgot to mention the bakery is spotless, so clean I would eat off the floor if I had to.
3	Man this place was the SHIT when I was a youngster!! \n\nNow... this place IS shit! I don't know where it happened. I think it may have been the deteriorating of Phoenix's youth or what have you. I will be honest in saying that I haven't been to this place in quite sometime, but I still like to remember the good ol' days on the water log rides and on the small lil coaster my mom would allow me to ride. and the times when I snuck away from my mom to ride the big desert storm. and keeping her away from the pictures taken of passengers mid loop as they were displayed on lil tv screens near a makeshift giftshop. \n\nThe food never stuck out to me, so I really can't review it. But I know that for a while, when it was still new and well-ran. This was a nice place. It was small but compact so it felt like excitment was just around the corner. But now, it feels small and compact, like there's so many people around you just want to scream just so you can have some personal space. \n\nI don't really like the whole thing with different types of kids playing with the games hogging them and you gotta fight them for a turn. I've never been one for golf but I still ilke to get my Tiger Woods on once in a great while. \n\nI don't really think this is a nice date place anymore. It's too ghetto. I think this is a place you take your long-term someone special. Like when all the magic is gone and the honey moon is OVER so ya'll are alright to just show up and kick some lil high schooler's ass to to get the go-cart you've been eyeing the entire time you've been in line!\n\nBut still go!  Have fun, assert yourself and your spot in line and the dibs you called. And dude... TOTALLY play golf course #2, it's the best! :D
1	After inquiring about several dishes and not finding exactly what i was looking for, I ordered some really simple.  Jook (congee, rice porridge).  A staple.  Ridiculously simple to make with the ingredients of rice, water, and a bit of ginger.  It was incredible how terrible the bowl was.\n\nThe price was good.  The appearance was fine, but the taste set a new record and not a good one.  It was straight narsty.  There was no rice taste whatsoever.  The only thing I could think was that they use mostly rice flour instead of rice to make it.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong things, but I don't think i'll be giving it another shot.  It is certainly not among the Best Hong Kong Dining in the valley.
4	I can see why some people give Grimaldi's five stars -- their execution is consistently perfect.  If you like the modern style of New York pizza, made with fresh mozzarella, you will enjoy your pie.  Period.  End of story.  Well, not quite.  Here are some issues:\n\n1.  The salads are large but uninspired.  Fresh, but just the usual ingredients.\n2.  The crust is thin and crispy -- if you like bready crusts, go somewhere else.\n3.  Here, the pizza is about the cheese, but the red sauce could be a bit better and more abundant.\n4.  It gets crowded easily -- you may have to wait.\n\nThis are really just minor things, but they add up.  Grimaldi's is a good pizzeria, but it is just a pizzeria after all.\n\nBy the way, they have another place in northern Scottsdale.  In my opinion, this location is better.  The pizzas up north have been soggy the two times I ate there.\n\nHint:  I think the milder toppings are better here because the crust and cheese are the stars.  Spicy pepperoni only detracts.  You might like tomato and basil.-
4	The burgers here have a tasty backyard burger quality to them and thus rank high on my list of decent local burger joints. The half-pound bacon double cheeseburger hits the spot and the french fries are appropriately crispy and delicious.\n\nAlthough they charge an extra 50 cents for your choice of dipping sauce, I highly recommend trying the chipotle barbeque sauce (especially on the fries). This sauce has an uncommon savory note that I have only been able to guess is from celery seed. Maybe other BBQ afficionados can better deduce the secret ingredient, but I stand by my assessment.\n\nOther reviewers are right to note that the burgers are a tad pricey, but the availability of original flavors (including the soda fountain) and a real homestyle burger makes Coal Burger worth a visit.
5	"""Had dinner here on Easter while in Scottsdale for vacation.  When we pulled-up in the parking lot and I could count the number of cars on less than both hands we were a little bit nervous.  We walked-in and was greeted by a VERY nice host.  Not sure if he was the owner but that's not relevant....he was VERY nice.  I always appreciate when the host in a restaurant tells you who your server will be.  Brad showed-up immediately with water.  Warm rolls were served to each of us and we were offered table olive oil.  The menu looked outstanding...had a hard time deciding.  My son had the usual.....spaghettie with marinara.  My daughter had Gnochi in Vodka sauce.....she LOVED it (and she's a little picky).  My wife was very adventurous and ordered the dumplings with Vodka sauce.  If I hadn't ordered the chicken parmagiana (which was hands down the BEST I've ever had), I would have ordered the dumplings.  The dumplings were a mix of light mozzerella cheese and proscuitto.  It was UNBELIEVABLE!  The Chicken Parmigaina was smashed-down thin, lightly breaded and tasted like something my grandmother would have made.\n\nOh yeah, the appetizers....we shared a brick-oven pizza (it was outstanding).  We also had \fried mozzerella\"""".  Two pieces about the size of a medium sized crab-cake....with a slice of proscuitto in the middle.....Have I used the word incredible yet?!  We also had a plate of proscuitto, salamai, olives and fresh-mozzeralla on tomatoes....Outstanding!\n\nService was outstanding.  Food was incredible.  Host asked us how dinner was on our way out....we told him we were in from Chicago and that the dinner and service was outstanding.  He said \""""wow, coming from Italians from Chicago that is the highest compliment\"""".\n\nI would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place for Italian food.  Beautiful restaurant, great bar, great service and the food (which is most important) is top notch.  DON'T MISS IT!!"""""""
4	"""I love Cornish Pasty....a more traditional Arizona fare simply does not exist in Tempe. When I bite into an Oggie, I imagine all the \Cousin Jacks\"""" in the mines from Bisbee to Jerome eating their pasty and leaving the arsenic tainted crumbs to pacify the \""""knockers.\""""\n\nDean, a native Cornishman, has blessed Tempe with the perfect belly filling fare for students, workmen, and tourist. His gourmet twist on the classics with curry and vindaloo will satiate the most hard-pleased epicure. \n\nHave a pint and a pasty soon, and see what you have been missing."""""""
4	It took three tries to eat here. The first time we called (Sunday), it was closed. And according to their voicemail greeting, Pizzeria Bianco was booked for the next two months. The second time, we were told that there was a three hour wait, at which news we freaked out a little and ended up going to another restaurant. The third time, we showed up an hour before the restaurant opened so that we only had to wait TWO hours for a table. We were in Arizona, dammit, and by golly we were going to eat at this pizza place everyone kept recommending even if it killed us. \n\nLuckily, they strategically opened their bar next door at 4 p.m. so that we could drown our boredom in cider and Mexican Coke while we waited. Their hostesses were stunning and very sweet, and very skilled at keeping hungry people happy during a two-hour wait.\n\nWe ended up ordering the Margherita, Rosa, Biancoverde, and Wiseguy pizzas. The Margherita and especially the Biancoverde were quite good and light. The Rosa and Wiseguy were very salty and oily. I wouldn't order them again. Still, the meal felt satisfying. \n\nPizzeria Bianco reminds me very much of Basic in San Diego; both places have the floppy, slightly charred, thin-crust pizzas, the rugged brick walls, the wood burning oven. But Basic has no wait, better hours, a full bar, cheaper pizza pies, and more toppings to choose from.\n\nSo is Pizzeria Bianco worth the wait? Sure, but more so you can say you experienced a Phoenix institution than for the food. 3.5 stars.
5	Awesome carne asada burritos, quesadillas and tacos. The quac is fresh and super tasty. The barbacoa tacos are a must especially with a bit of the owners special homemade sauces. Growing up eating this stuff, this place is definately as authentic and fresh as it gets. The owner was wonderful and very attentive. This is now my go to place for authentic quesadillas and tacos when visiting AZ. To compliment the great food and service, the price of it is great. We had a nacho supreme, guac and chips, carne asada quesadilla, carne asada quesadilla platter, carne asada burrito, 3 barbacoa tacos, and 3 horchatas for $53 and every single item blew our mind. :-)
4	Copper Star is a great example of adaptive use in the heart of the Melrose curve. Who would have thought that a building initially designed to provide fuel to cars would so work so well serving fuel to humans?\n\nTheir coffee is locally roasted and, while not my favorite, is well above average in Phoenix. Their drive-thru is a great feature for those mornings when I'm running late. For the coffee adverse, Copper Star serves chai, tea, smoothies, Italian sodas, and some unique drinks including a black cherry limeade. Foodwise, there is a wide selection of baked goods,including some of the best bagels. They also have decent lunch offerings, such as sandwiches and a tasty hummus platter. But where they shine is their 'home baked' cupcakes. (I've seen Mayor Gordon here on several occasions getting his cupcake fix!) \n\nDespite being in a converted gas station/garage, the atmosphere is quite a bit more cozy than most of the other coffee shops in central Phoenix. While the sandblasted block walls and exposed ceiling let that building's industrial past peak through, this is offset by rotating art work and selection of comfortable (if a bit dingy) couches and easy chairs as well as small bistro tables and long 'work' tables to choose from. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the owner, Bill, is a great neighborhood resource. He can tell you anything and everything going on along 7th Ave.\n\nAll in all a good place to grab a coffee and cupcake,  meet a friend or get some old fashioned reading done. I can't recommend it for serious work requiring internet access, however, as the wifi access remains intermittent at best.
4	I like Smashburgers and this location is the closet to me.\n\nWhat can I say I enjoy a good burger and Smashburger delivers to my taste bud. You can order beer here, which I don't think this particular location does well since there are so many kids running around.  Then again it's close to a movie theater and I gather and the teenagers need a place to loiter.  \n\nI always order my favorite the Arizona burger with sweet potato fries!  I love the kick it has with the jalapenos and guacamole.  I wonder if each state has it's own burger? - Enjoy!
3	"""You don't find many old-school, diner-style restaurants around. Hangar Cafe is certainly one of them though. The only thing this place is missing are the bad attitude, hoarse-voiced waitresses calling you \hon\""""...and that's a good thing.\n\nHearty, stick-to-your-ribs breakfasts: 3-egg omelets, corned beef hash, bacon & eggs...and they're generous with the hashbrowns too. You probably won't leave hungry. The quality of the food is a little spotty though--having been the recipient of lukewarm food on at least one occasion. And, the coffee is unfortunately also \""""diner style,\"""" weak and bitter (avoid)."""""""
5	Yoli's Cafe has THE BEST service hands down.  They were very accommodating of our large group and our requests.  Our waitresses were patient and friendly.\n\nThe monte cristo breakfast sandwich was AMAZING!!! but what really blew me away were that they served the best pancakes in the world! The food was so good that our group came back the next day for lunch.  The pulled pork was delicious!  \n\nAll the food tasted fresh and made with love.  I wish I lived in Chandler so that I can have this place every week. \n\nIf I am ever in Arizona again, I will be sure to make a trip out to Yoli's
3	Meh.. Its a cafeteria I guess so don't really expect much more. Maybe I am just not that into meatballs and the gravy and the lingonberry or something. That was the only thing that made this place stand out from a Luby's ( do they even have those any more?)\n\nIf you are in the habit of hanging around in Ikea as a day trip I could see being grateful for it. I am not married and don't have kids so maybe I just don't spend that much time furniture shopping to appreciate it to be all OH SNAP!..\n\nThat was the best chicken Cesar salad from a plastic container and carried on a tray I ever had.\n\nIt was good cafeteria food.. I wouldn't hesitate to eat there again next time I am shopping for my next BASISK ,or AL\u00c4NG or even a DUDER\u00d6 (or what ever) but I sure would not seek this place out like my friend. No beer either.. That would definitely bump them up a star..\n\nARE YOU LISTENING TO ME IKEA!? \n\nYou guys would make a killing not to mention another star if you just had a little booze.. Well just think about it anyway.
3	Looks:  The actual bar is beautiful, backlit with soft colored lights that change on a timer.  The layout, however, is absurd.  The bar is 15 yards away from the hotel door and registration desk, with nothing in between.  Who wants to see tired travelers hauling luggage?  Put up a curtain or something.  \n\nCrowd:  Dismal.  At 7:30, we were 2 of 4 people there.  I can't imagine this place attracting much besides hotel guests.\n\nFood:  Only appetizers.  We got the white bean hummus, which was good, but not great.  The sliders at another table looked very tasty.\n\nValue:  Appetizers are $6.  Drinks are cheap during happy hour (4-7), but expensive otherwise.\n\nService:  Excellent.  They charged the wrong price for my beer, but they took it off completely when we mentioned the mistake.\n\nMiscellaneous:  They have live music on Wednesdays, and the guy doing acoustic covers was actually quite talented.  (No tip jar... Jack needs a manager.)  They have a martini flight, so you can try 3 different martinis for $8 during HH.\n\nVerdict:  I'd go back on a Wednesday to hear Jack and try the sliders, but let's just say this place isn't making it into my rotation.
4	The parking at this facility is a joke.  Depending on where you park you have to walk up to a mile just to get to the ballpark entrance.  I don't have a problem with walking as excercising is good for you but what the hell was Goodyear thinking ?\n\nThe exterior of the ballpark is nothing to brag about but once inside its a great place to catch a game.  My favorite spot at this park is the RF Pavillions where you pay $30 and get all you can eat hamburgers, hotdogs, bratwursts, bake beans, potatoe salad, cookies and unlimited soda's and water.\n\nFrom this section you also get to interact with the players as they leave the dugouts during the game.  Players enter and exit basically centerfield.  I got to see Kerry Wood and interacted with Thome from the White Sox.  \n\nI even got a free ball for my 11 month old son by simply asking one of the Indian players.  Lots of sun in the RF Pavillion but plenty of shade too if you want it.\n\nThe last two games I attended were really good games coming down to the final inning.  I say its worth a drive at least once.  For the value, the 30 minute drive and the half mile trek is worth it to catch a spring training game.\n\nRegarding the walk .. don't fret there are shuttles and golf cart transports for those who need it.  Elderly, disabled, folks with tired and cranky small children.  \n\nEverybody else .. stop being lazy and walk !
2	Stayed here for a long weekend. \n\nReserved a standard room with a king size bed. Check in was quick and painless. However, was given keys to a room with two double beds. Was told that all reservations made through third parties are automatically given a room w/ two doubles.....was ultimately given a room with a king bed. No big deal. Hotel was a virtually empty. \n\nHotel is old, old, old. The safety on the electrical outlet kept getting tripped by the ultra-high voltage device I always carry with me...my cell phone charger. Television set was ancient and terrible. Lock on the room door was broken. This might not make sense, but the room was very creaky. Bed was worn out. \n\nNow back to my comment regarding the hotel being virtually empty. The last night of our stay, a bus load of 10-13 year olds on a field trip were put in rooms on all sides of us. It was as if they literally put us in their block of rooms. There must have been forty of them with no more than one or two chaperons. They commenced to bang around and scream till the wee hours of the morning. Why is God's name did they have to put them all around us in an empty hotel? \n\nWith so many other great options in Scottsdale, certainly no reason to give this place another shot.
4	"""I haven't been to a Pride event for over 6 years the reason being, every bad choice that you slept with just so happens to be there. You know the walk of shame should only happen once, right?! \n\nIn any case, the event was a whole lot of fun.. sort of like a giant gay bar with kids in strollers, LOL! Drinks were 5 bucks which was cool and there were plenty of friends to hang out with. \n\nVery cool things, hats off to the organizers..\n\n1. $5 bucks for drinks, awesome!\n\n2. Diverse selection of things to eat.. hehe..\n\n3. Great entertainment\n\n4. Overall size was great, far larger than 6 years ago\n\nOf course I have a few complaints for the organizers..\n\n1. If you're going to ban \professional\"""" camera equipment, you need to tell everyone that before hand, not at the gate after they've parked a mile away! \n\n2. Need to hire a janitorial service to maintain the port-a-potties and hand washing stations.. later in the afternoon there was no water and no soap, gross. What was even more disgusting were the bloody fucking tampons thrown on the floor of the potties.. I know that's not your fault, however someone constantly maintaining and cleaning the stalls would have been awesome! \n\n3. Not enough shade.. more hang out tents would have been awesome.. even with sunblock I got roasted.. the few shade trees that were there I felt like an Emperor Penguin, packed body to body, constantly rotating in and out of the shade with the attempt to stay cool rather than warm.\n\nKudos to the organizers and all of the sponsors, a job well done!"""""""
2	My husband and I made a reservation at The Greene House at the insistence of my foodie friend.  She claimed that I had to go for the doughnut!  So we did...\n\nWe had to wait about 5-10 minutes, even with a reservation, and the bar area was packed...we stood hovering at the door with other couples in anticipation of our feast.\n\nWe were greeted promptly and ordered wine.  As we perused the menu, it was determined that because we were definitely getting the doughnut, I would forgo an appetizer and ordered the Braised Short Rib.  My husband, however, was intrigued by the tortilla soup and fish tacos, which came highly recommended by our server.  \n\nHe returned shortly after taking our order with a basket of bread and butter...my excitement peaked and then fell when I placed my hand on a cold dense roll; I was hoping it would be fresh and warm, but sadly it was the butter that was warm and melty.\n\nThe tortilla soup arrived and I quickly asked for a second spoon; I need to at least taste it!  My husband stirred the dollop of cream and tortilla strips into the brothy soup and took a taste...no response.  My spoon arrived, I took a taste, and found it to be lacking flavor depth and heartiness that tortilla soup is famous for. Even my husband suggested it needed some citrus or fresh herbs...maybe even a little more heat.  Not thrilled, and didn't even finish it.\n\nWhen our entrees arrived, my foodie excitement reappeared as the Braised Short ribs were placed in front of me...glistening in a demi-glaze the short rib----though no rib to be seen- sat atop a smooth pool of potato puree and was topped with a large onion and small nubs of carrots and a piece of celery greens.  The flavor was spot on, though nothing out of the ordinary or flavor popping and the meat was literally melt-in-your mouth.  At first I thought there wasn't enough, maybe because it was so tender and yummy I didn't want it to end, but as we got closer to the end of our meal, I found that  I couldn't finish it.  Oddly, however, my usually non meat-eating husband, found it within himself to take one for the team by eating the final bites of the tender goodness; he couldn't even resist!\nHis tacos, he said, didn't thrill him.  While the waiter bragged about the portion of fish used in their tacos; we didn't seem to think so.  As a result, I didn't even want to take a bite so as to leave more for my honey...so sadly, I can not report on the tacos...though he did let me take a bite of the white bean salad that was on the side, which was quite flavorful.\n\nThen came dessert....we knew we wanted, as it came highly recommended, so we ordered it blindly.: the doughnut.  I was sad, however, to see that there was NO chocolate whatsoever; not dripped, none to dip, not a chip!  I was happy to see they give you the WHOLE doughtnut....hole and all, and along side the cinnamon-sugared-fried sweetness was a small ramekin of vanilla bean custard with a dollop of strawberry.  My husband enjoyed it very much, whereas I had only a few bites...it's more like a classic doughnut than the krispy kreme in that it was more dense than I would have preferred and not enough custard to compliment the dryness of the doughnut itself.\n\nOverall, it was ok...though I don't think we would go back.
5	This is a fantastic donation center, and Goodwill is a wonderful charity.\n\nI've been cleaning out Club Scotchdale (aka my house) and getting rid of many old items (books, clothes, shoes and a laptop). I loaded up my car, and made my trek up to this location.\n\nAs soon as I pulled up, a very nice attendant came out and unloaded my car for me, and kindly gave me a receipt for my donations.\n\nThis is a drop-off only location, so if you are looking to make a purchase, try the location on 32nd and Thomas.\n\nKeep Goodwill in mind when you need to get some old stuff off your hands.

5	I just realized I wrote my review of Divinity Tattoo and posted it to the Scottsdale location (duh!), so I'm moving it here.  I plan to return very soon for my next tattoo and am sure my second experience will be as great as the first!\n\nOriginally posted 1/19/09\nI had been wanting a second tattoo for years.  I decided this weekend I would finally have it done.  I asked a few friends for recommendations but didn't want to drive out to the far east valley.  After reading the first four reviews for Divinity, I checked out their website and the portfolios of the artists at the Phoenix location.  I was very impressed and called to make an appointment with Ryan Campbell.  When I arrived at the shop today, I was very impressed with everything I saw.  The decor was gorgeous, everyone was friendly, and Ryan was very knowledgeable.  He was very patient while I decided on the size and exact placement of my tattoo.  After he was finished, I was extremely pleased, and spoke to him briefly about my next tattoo.  I'm already looking forward to making my next appointment with him.
3	This place has been around for a long time (at least 30 years).  Apparently it used to be quite a popular hang out for certain circles back in the day, and many locals still regularly visit.  The location is in a small nondescript building on the corner.  You can enter through the front door or through the back door from the parking lot and walk through the kitchen (somewhat odd, but ok..).  The dining area is a small wood panel lined room with only a single tiny half window.  You are definitely not here to enjoy the atmosphere.  The menu choice is a bit limited. I tried the egg flower soup (yummy), pork fried rice (good), mongolian beef (not bad), and shrimp chop suey (not bad).  It was basic fast food chinese fare, good but not great.  Also soft drinks only come in cans. The food certainly did not impress, nor did anything else really.  On my own, I probably would not return here, however, my friend is one of those locals I referred to above so I'm sure I will be back.  The owners are very friendly as well.
4	Hooray!  Now that's summer and I'm not working, I can explore places in my neighborhood that are only open during the day.\n\nThat's A Wrap is great.  I had the Veggie Jackson wrap, which sounded really weird (eggplant and rice, really?) but was delicious.  I had it with a side of pasta salad which was also fresh and tasty.  Luckily for me, they have no soda machine, so I was left with only (mostly healthy) choices.  :)  \n\nI wish they had a few more straight-up vegetarian choices, but I guess anything can be made veggie with tofu, which is pretty sweet.\n\nI'm glad I have lots of summer left to try this place out again.
5	"""Don't know what Simply D is talking about but sounds like those drinks that the bartender \added\"""" on not only impaired his typing skills but also his mathematical skills.

1	"""The only reason I gave them one star is because it wouldn't allow me to give them none. I'm not even sure where to start..

Frustrated I left and ordered online. The next day I logged into the account I created during my purchase and could see personal information for All of their recent customers. When I went in and told them their online system was set up to allow users to see the entire inventory system and other buyers info they apologized and said it was a new system.

4	Why won't Helen Keller drive? \n\nBecause she has to park in a shady neighborhood every time she goes to Oregano's. \n\nBut other than that I hear, I mean, I see her signing that she loves the meatball sandwich and pizza this place has. \n\nService gets a little slow because this place is always packed but if you get the stuffed mushrooms it makes it worth it. \n\nAlso, they only have one dessert, which makes it easy for your date to choose...or sign
2	"""I've read so many good reviews about this place and its close to where I work, so I thought I'd try it out.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I felt that the food was so-so and restaurant was dingy and sticky.  Normally I wouldn't care about the later, because the \dive-y\"""" places are usually the best. Not in this case. . .  The only reason I went back a 2nd time is because I thought that maybe I just ordered the wrong dish or that they were having an off day, because of all the great reviews.  I tried, but unfortunately for me, the same thing happened on my next visit.  I just wasn't impressed.  Sadly, I don't think I'll be giving Maxim a \""""3rd time's the charm\"""" chance."""""""
4	While strolling through Old Town Scottsdale one afternoon, my wife and I came across this little gem near the corner of 1st Ave and Scottsdale Blvd.  We were drawn in by the smell of brisket and ribs wafting through the air, and after reviewing the menu, decided to make reservations for dinner.\n\nEven with the Spring Training dinner rush, the service was still quick and friendly.  After browsing around the room to see what others ordered, and asking for recommendations from our server, we decided to start with the fresh guacamole (fresh chopped avocado, not mashed, with chopped onions and tomatoes), followed by the bone marrow.  If you've never had marrow, I recommend you try it!  Big Earl's serves their huge marrow bones with toast and a wonderful tomato-onion jam!\n\nFor our meal we decided to split the brisket with jalapeno corn bread and slaw, and added a crock of mac 'n cheese.  The slices of brisket were HUGE, with a thin layer of fat (it's BBQ, a little fat is OK) and a wonderful smokey flavor.  The brisket was also served with two squeeze bottles of sauce...one a sweet and tangy, the other more resembled a vinegar sauce I would expect from the south east.  The cornbread wasn't out of the word, but still delicious.  The slaw was freshly made, not pre-bought, with a hint of apple vinegar.  The Mac 'n cheese was creamy and provided a nice contrast to the rest of the meal.  \n\nAll-in-all, we enjoyed our experience and would come again!  The only reason I rated 4 out of 5 was because was because they were out of St. Louis style ribs.  :-(
1	Not impressed. I had not been here in a while but remembered as much better than it was tonight.  As I sit here my stomach hurts. We ordered a turkey burger, it was dry and had an odd taste combined with the taste of char (which was dominating). My husband got a mushroom burger, the mushrooms were so weird (chopped into nothing, clearly from a can and a sick yellow color). My daughters kids burger was all char no flavor.  Very disappointing.  We left most of our food, when the waitress came over she could see by the looks on our face that it was not going over well, she never offered anything.  Usually when most of the food except one or 2 bites are still on the plate that might trigger some alarm bells.
5	Oh. My. God. I love this place. \n\nSure, I went here opening day and it was crazy. The staff was harried, the old people were pissing me off, but it was awesome.\n\nNow, as I've mentioned in previous reviews I'm not a fan of TJ's. I appreciate that there are hardcore TJ lovers. I'm not a fan also of the big chain stores either. ::cough::Albertsons::Fry's::cough,cough::\n\nI like to think F&E falls some place in the middle. It's the small corner store that you run to in a pinch, but big enough to shop there regularly. Previous reviews of F&E locations mentioned the prepackaged nature of all the food. Personally, I like that. Makes my life a little easier.\n\nOther things I love: the prepackaged meals. I picked up a frozen entree and refrigerated Chicken Masala meal. Verdict is out on taste, but well it looked fresher and easier than anything I've found in a chain store. \n\nI love that they carry regular brands. I have the option, albeit limited, to get Hidden Valley Ranch or F&E salad dressing. I can pick up Pantene Pro-V and some F&E egg noodles. Now keep in mind, they don't carry the larger sized items that most stores do. Again, this is fine for me and my husband. It takes us a year to go through a giant thing of ketchup.\n\nI love that they have some harder to find items. My regular grocery store doesn't carry creme fraiche. F&E does. They had udon noodles, can't say I've seen that in my chain store. \n\nLastly, I love that organic here doesn't mean a significant cost increase. Too often the organic option I find for an item is greatly more than the regular version. I'd love to shop 100% organic but really, my wallet prevents it at times. Even non organic items are healthier as they take out preservatives and additives. \n\nIs F&E one stop shopping? No. Is it groceries made convienent for me? Absolutely. I doubt I'll be saving tons of money by coming here but I love this place. The environment is good, it's simple and it's well...Fresh and Easy.
5	"""I've been here 5 times and \take away\"""" 3 times since their opening and have had great \""""clean, organic, healthy\"""" food each time.  Love it and it makes you feel so good.  Great decor, I practice the diet philosophy and really appreciate the extra hard work that goes into the prep.  The salmon, wild Alaska sockeye, sustainably harvested--thank you.  More US restaurants need to buy wild Alaskan fish. The salmon was as good as my Alaska summer salmon eating experience at Cafe Orca.    Not overcooked--thank you again.  The black cod is fabulous, paired nicely with a sake.  The salmon came with a delicious kale salad, simply flavored with ?pecorino? cheese, evoo and lemon--wonderful and great for my health concerns.  Have had all the appetizers and each is great in its own right and you really can't loose.  Now I just have to get beyond the fish and try some of the other entree's.  I like that they don't offer any chemicals and feature organics and take away is dished up in biodegradable packaging.  Service is efficient, friendly and unpretentious.  Only one fault, once, the hostesses were too busy with their personal conversation to say good bye--no biggie, since I go for the food which you can't get anywhere else.  Price is good considering the extra expense they incur for procuring higher quality ingredients and the extra cost of food prep requiring more labor.  A good choice for lifestyle conscious dining, so take that really fussy, eccentric, quirky friend that is never pleased and watch the smile return to their critical face.  Worth every penny!  One itty bitty suggestion for Sam and Andrew--Alaskan Oysters on the half shell!  I'll be back--soon!"""""""
5	I have been eying this place for quite some time now considering one of my best friends has checked in here 28 times, and one of my other friends just discovered it and was ranting about it. So last night I had to give it a whirl. \nDon't be thrown off by the building itself. Yes, it looks like a dive that would serve crumby food, but alas inside great things are being done! I had the classic gyro. Delicious!! Perfectly seasoned meat, a fantastic pita and fresh vegetables. What's not to love? You have the option of having either a salad or fries with your meal. I went with the french fries. These fries are DECEPTIVELY good!! They look like your typical frozen fries, which they are but somehow they are great and are seasoned with season salt, always a plus. \nMan am I salivating right now just thinking about it. I would like to add that this place is value for its buck. The portions are huge and appropriately priced. I will be back for sure and sooner than later!!
4	I've been here quite a few times over the years- sometimes for dinner, sometimes for drinks and sometimes for both.  It's a really cool place to people watch and the food is pretty good- not great- but good.  They do have some specialty martinis and the desserts are awesome. Try the strawberry shortcake or cheesecake- you'll thank me after, trust me! Just watch out for the strange man that dresses like JLo.  Seriously. I've seen him there twice, he's always alone and wearing supertight pants, a sparkly belt, kicky boots and an extremely tight top.
4	I first came to this restaurant with my dad and his wife a few years ago. She is from Japan and my dad works with a lot of Japanese executives and they both said that whenever friends come from Japan, this is where they go. Cherry Blossom is a very different and authentic restaurant. If you haven't tried it I definitely reccommend it. I have had noodles before and most recently tried the curry and both were great. My husband had the pad thai and enjoyed it as well. They also have some italian noodle dishes if you have picky eaters with you!
4	I was really on the fence if I should give this review 3 or 4 stars.\n\nStopped in yesterday for the s'mores milkshake. This was my first visit to Beckett's Table and I've been wanting to try it ever since I heard a review about their chocolate covered bacon! The chocolate covered bacon is served as part of their s'mores dessert. For Arizona Dairy month they have made this dessert into a milkshake.\n\nThe milkshake was tasty but just ok in my opinion. I think it had one or two too many flavors going on for my preference. It had the standard s'mores ingredients of marshmallow, chocolate, graham crackers and also had an addition of bacon, caramel and peanut butter. I think if the peanut butter had been left out it would have been way better! (I like peanut butter but it just seemed to take away from the other delicious flavors instead of add to them.) \n\nThe part of the shake I was looking forward to the most was the chocolate covered bacon! Sadly, the piece that came with the shake tasted burnt. (This coming from someone who likes their bacon very well done!) But when we mentioned it to our server he was very nice and brought us out two more pieces of chocolate covered bacon to make up for it. And those ones tasted better. =)\n\nSpeaking of the service...it was great. This is the reason for the 4 stars. The atmosphere is lovely. They are very attentive on filling up your water glass and making sure you enjoyed everything. It was great till the end, when we wanted to get our check...which took a while. But I don't hold that against them...our server seemed to have too many tables to look after. \n\nI hope to stop in again to try their food when I have more time.
5	My friend told me about this place, but I never had any desire to check it out because the name of that restaurant sounds like an ordinary Chinese restaurant.\n\nWe finally stop by on a Sunday evening; to our very surprise, this place is VERY GOOD. \n\nThe decoration is elegant unlike other old-school Chinese restaurants with corny cheap oriental deco.\n\nThe food is perfect especially the roast duck, which is by far the best I have had tasted in my life. No kidding.\n\nExcept Golden Buddah and Flo's, now, we have one more Chinese restaurant that we can bring our guests to.
4	"""Likes:\n-Cheaper drinks than most bars in Phoenix (cough-ihatecopperbluesprices-cough)\n-Hearing music playing in the venue area\n-Not being rushed to leave tables and you can hang in here awhile\n\nDislikes:\n-1 stall bathroom for women (and men apparently?) I know they probably don't have the room, but it really sucks when someone takes more than 5 min. and you are waiting\n-Brought in a coupon that apparently was \not approved by them\"""" but on a top coupon site. I got a \""""well fine.. we will honor it this time, but only on one drink. you can't use that here again, we don't approve those coupons\"""" I felt like a criminal. Just posting a sign about coupons would be a good idea\n-The way the bar is set up with a crooked line to order a drink, you got to just grab the bartenders attention. I wish the had a system because it makes it difficult when it is busy"""""""
5	Excellent chaat! Dont go by the looks of the place, the food is one of the best around here. They have been very consistent with the quality of the food which is rare for Indian restaurants in the valley. I have tried almost all the chaat items on the menu and have never been disappointed. The gravies that come along with the combo specials are not that great. Their Vada Paav (Indian burger) deserves a special mention.\nDefinitely try the place for a quick and tasty evening snack.
3	The Good:\n - The service was excellent, and the real stand out was the hostess.  She was friendly, patient, and took good care of us.\n - The patio is awesome!\n - the specialty drinks are delicious.  Not too sweet, and unique.\n\nThe menu is limited, which can be both a good or bad thing.  Frankly, I prefer a menu that isn't pages and pages long.  It makes me wonder about the freshness about the food when there are 500 dishes.\n\nI tried the potato chips with blue cheese.  They were a-amazing!  My only suggestion was to be sure to split these with at least two other people.  \n\nThe Not-So-Good:\nI didn't care for the skewers.  I found the spices to be bitter, and the spicy chili side bland.  I also found the beef to be especially tough and gristly.  \n\nOverall, I would go back with friends, and possibly bring a dog or two, have some tasty drinks, and split some chips.  Another good social restaurant from the people that brought you postino.
3	I like to go here for the hummus and chicken platter and this is it!  There is nothing else that I like here, other than the rice pudding, which is STILL amazing.  I got the broiled fish sandwich the other day and the lettuce was all soggy and the sauce was SO blah, it was a very boring meal with very little flavor.  \n\nThis location is always soooo crowded as well, so plan on a wait.  The to go area is so always so backed up and unorganized.  I saw the guy from the kitchen bring my food out and say my name to the lady running the to go counter and it took another 10 minutes for her to give it to me.  The only reason this place get's three stars is because the hummus and chicken platter is really good.
2	"""I've always loved eating at Pita Jungle on Scottsdale and Shea.  As some other reviewers have already noted, this particular location doesn't have the same feel to it because of its \Trying-too-hard-to-be-modern\"""" atmosphere.  I was shocked on how loud the hyper-paced music was, and how non-intimate the seating felt.  Since I like the food so much, I'll continue to patronize the Scottsdale location...even though I live so close to this Happy Valley one.  Also, the staff seemed far less \""""mature\"""" with their mannerism.  Even the older waitresses dressed and talked like they were still in High school...very gross."""""""
4	full disclosure:\nme - not indian. so don't really look at me as a trusted source for all things indian. sure, i have tons of indian friends who have been kind enough to cook for me and to initiate me into the 'we love bollywood movies' fan club, but i definitely am no expert. so with that said, take this review for what it is: an observation from someone who misses all the indian goodness she left behind in LA\n\nalright, so india plaza. first off, love the name. its right to the point. im definitely not going here looking for vietnamese food. i visited the shop next to the dhaba restaurant and was pleased to meet (what i think was) the owner. really friendly guy who was more than happy to show us around and to help us find some items. \n\nthe store was clean and smelled delicious. it was stocked with all sorts of goodies. as someone who doesn't yet know how to make roti from scratch, i was pleased to see some frozen roti in the freezer section. happy aly.\n\ni could literally spend a whole hour in here looking at all the various goodies and strange packaging. it definitely did remind me of the larger indian grocery stores back in cypress and whittier.\n\nall in all i think this place is going to be great for me. i'll be able to experiment with different types of curry and maybe one day be brave enough to make my roti. now where did i put my chai masala?
4	So currently the hubby and I are in the process of buying a house. We had to drive out to North Scottsdale to sign some paperwork and since we were in the area we stopped in at The Skeptical Chymist for dinner and drinks. \n\nI found the price of food and drinks to be slightly pricey and that would be my only complaint about this place.\n\nThe food however is very tasty. I ordered the fish and chips and my husband ordered the mustard crusted tenderloin stuffed with spinach. I got a bit of food envy when I tasted my husbands food. I would recommend ordering that dish.\nThe fish and chips were decent. You get a big beer battered filet which is nicely seasoned with thick chips.\n\nBeing a proud Irish lass I enjoy Irish pubs that actually play great Irish music and Skeptical Chymist does a great job. Sure you hear the cliche, popular bands like U2 and The Cranberries, but they also played The Pogues and some traditional Irish songs. \n\nThe place had a great look and feel to it. They really made it look as close to a traditional Irish pub and I felt really comfortable just hanging out and drinking my Smithwicks.\n\nOn this particular evening the place was pretty sparse, not many people, but I'm sure on weekends this place gets hoppin'.\n\nThe fact that this place played The Pogues should warrant a five star review, but because I find the prices to be slightly high they only get four stars.\nI would definitley go back if I'm in the neighborhood again.
4	I was craving this place so I was happy from the minute I parked the car.  I had the 2 tacos, rice and beans.  The rice and beans were fabulous, the tacos were so-so, but still filled my craving.  What I really wanted were chips and guacamole because I saw some other people eating them and they looked divine.  Anyhow, I plan to go back and try more items off the menu.  But for the most part, I was pretty happy.\n\n1/27/08-- the chips deserve 5 stars ohhhh the chips!!!!!!!!  \nI had the cheese enchilada's last night, not good. 1 star
3	I think you could pretty easily compare this restaurant to an IHOP/Village Inn type establishment. It was similarly priced but the food was definitely better than your typical (cheaper) breakfast joint. We were seated right away but there seemed to be a pretty consistent wait in the small dining room. Our table was in a pretty cramped area which I normally don't mind but few people would ever want to sit that close to my typical frazzled Sunday morning self. \n\nOur food was average. I had a pecan waffle and OJ, the hubby had a short stack of yeast pancakes, home-style potatoes and OJ. It was all OK, our service was good and the check with tip totaled $26 (cash ONLY.) A good alternative to typical breakfast chains but overall nothing that made me swoon over my plate.
4	Yesterday, I dined at the Pita Jungle.  I was thinking the place would have decor similar to Rainforest Cafe with a jungle type scene, but that was not the case.  It was a well maintained sit-down restaurant, but with more of a chill atmosphere.  I got the white meat chicken pita sandwich that came with onions, tomato, and cucumber sauce.  It was a great portion and just for $6.50!  I was very impressed, and I will have to come back and try something new!
2	I give the 2 stars because my therapist is the one that deserves the stars. I was very disappointed in the way my appointment was handled. I requested the apt online first and in that request I mentioned I had just ran a half marathon. They called to make the apt, but had to leave me a message. I called them back explained I had ran a marathon again and scheduled the apt. Turns out, when I checked in, they told me why didn't I schedule a hour and half apointment instead of just the hour. I didn't know why they asked this, but it turns out, the extra half is comped for those that ran the pf chang marathon.  They missed telling me this information 2 x's prior. They asked if I wanted to re-schedule my appointment so I could take advantage of that promo......NO I am sore today!!!!
4	Three and a half stars. Frank and Lupe's is more authentic to me than it is tasty, though I have always found it to be very pleasant and accommodating. \n\nDuring the breakfast hour, I recommend the Huevos Rancheros. I have been fortunate enough to eat these in Mexico a number of times, and the F and L's version is the closest I have found on this side of the border. \n\nChips and salsa are also to par, which is always a good barometer. The lunches I have had there have been good, but slightly disappointing after the impressive breakfast. \n\nA charming, comfortable spot, with good food and good service.
4	So, if you want to go out and be pretentious like I do and know you're in a really hip little place that few people outside of downtown know about, go to the Lost Leaf. I love the art.  Always very dark and brooding. Beer selection is amazing. I normally loathe beer. Lighting is usually excellent. I only get a few disappointed stares for being unironic. I'd love it if they had a full bar but whatever. I'll live and learn to drink a brewski from time to time. But, overall, it's a very cool place. Check it out. And if you love beer to begin with it's probably heaven.
3	More like Bland-co.\n\nI found myself being pulled towards the seared ahi tacos, but upon arrival they really didn't have much going on.  I would have liked to see some sauce on them or something.  The rice served with it wasn't even Spanish rice, and wtf is up shredded carrots as a side.  Blah!\n\nThe highlight of the evening was definitely the white peach margarita - OUTSTANDING and one of the best drinks I've ever had.  However, seemed a little light on the tequila.  After chugging 2 of them on an empty stomach, I would have expected Mr. Buzz to pay me a nice visit.  Instead, I got his niece.
4	You know, sometimes you just need some old school ghetto Italian food, and the OG services that purpose for me! \n\nYes....I am a fan of Olive Garden, THERE I said it! I could live off of their salad and bread sticks alone! \n\nI always order the same thing and it always tastes the same. That's one thing a chain restaurant like the OG has going for them, consistently the same. Doesn't matter where I go in the U.S. my eggplant parmigiana will always taste and look the same. \n\nLast Friday I didn't want to cook and I wanted Italian. Since we are still somewhat new to the 'hood and don't know all the local spots yet, we jumped in the car and went to Olive Garden. When we pulled up there were people EVERYWHERE, like laying in the grass outside of the restaurant all homeless style. I thought for sure it would be an hour wait, but the hostess said 20-30 minutes. We saddled up to the bar, got an adult beverage and 20 minutes later we were being shown to our seat. \n\nI must say, our waiter was FANTASTIC! His name was Will and he deserves a raise! He was on top of the ball, had a bit of cheese about him on the delivery of his lines, but it was never annoying (I HATE when waiters pour on the cheese and don't know when to stop, or how to be funny) But no Will, dude was all over it and great! \n\nOur dinners arrived fast, tasted great and our drinks never got low.
5	Many may think eating at a restaurant that sets up in a parking lot after the car shop closes might be dicey as far as the health code goes but as we all know, the city health inspectors are crooks and hired usually through nepotism and political graft (how else would Denny's remain open?), so I say forge ahead and experience Nogales Hot Dogs!\n\nMy friend, Mike, had spoken often about me trying a heavenly wiener, and as he's heterosexual, I assumed it was a food product. To my delight and relief, it was.\n\nMike and I arrived just as they set up and with a little bit of everything on the bacon-wrapped dogs and glass bottles of Coca-Cola, I was scarfing down the delicious mystery meat and considering having another, even though it would be too much to digest and I'd be throwing up from the acid reflux.\n\nI can't recommend this place highly enough. Get there early because it fills up fast. As for the next morning, depending on how much hot stuff you put on your dog, you might not want to make any early appointments.
1	I heard good things about this place and thought I'd bring my daughters there for dinner.  I ordered shrimp parmesan for 20 dollars and got four overcooked shrimp covered in sauce with watery white rice on the side.  My daughter ordered Linguini with clams and it was too gritty for her to eat.  I literally heard her bite into a sandy clam.  My other daughter ordered fettucini alfredo which was decent.  The best part of the meal was the bread served beforehand.  Even the caesar salad was disappointing.  I have to say that for a $75 tab, there are plenty of other places I would rather go.
4	Pita Jungle is like a grandparent.  Extremely reliable, always fills you up when you visit, and hasn't changed style in over a decade.  And like a good grandparent, you don't need a reservation to get in, but patience is virtue because sometimes there's a wait...but it's worth it.\n\nPersonally, I love the specials list on menus because they're unique and odds are, you might not see them again.  Yesterday, I ordered the grilled cajun mahi mahi with toasted pita chips and jalepeno cilantro hummus.  Yeah, I know. That was quite an order.  But for $10, it's a great portion and the fish was prepared perfectly!\n\nI highly recommend PJ for lunch and as soon as the server shows up, I highly recommend you order the trio hummus plate along with the tropical tea! What a good start to a good day :)
1	"""I was very disappointed with my experience at Unleashed. The staff was very disoriented and everyone seemed preoccupied with personal business.  I feel like my dog was not given the attention promised and most likely was left in a so called \suite\"""" her entire stay. When picking my girl up on the weekend, she was not with the other dogs and no one could tell me how she did during her stay and they also seemed very uninterested and I felt that just being there I was a bother to them. I feel bad for my pup and will never board her again, it makes me sick to my stomach to think of how she must have felt like I abandoned her or left her at a shelter. I expected a whole lot more for the crazy amount I was made to prepay. I DO NOT recommend this place unless you are rich and don't care about your dog."""""""
4	Yummmmy. For such a humble name, this place really exceeds expectations.  \n\nNice ambiance, and good food.  They really impressed me right off the bat with their chips and salsa.  The chips were assortment that were quite good and far from the ordinary corn tortillas you'd expect at any old Mex/Tex-Mex restaurant.   I had  the tortilla soup and the spinach & mushroom quesadilla which were quite good too.  But, I must say, the best part was the white chocolate tamales that they serve at the end of the meal... a most pleasant surprise and a wonderful end to a nice meal :)
4	They really know how to take care of their guests here. A lot of amenities at no extra cost is a plus.\n\nI came here on a business trip and they cater to a typical business person. They have a business center with free copies, fax and computer and Internet access. They also have a fitness center. Couple of semi-old treadmills, exercise bike and an elliptical machine with some weight machines.\n\nThere's a bar and grill next to the lobby. And they have daily happy hour specials.\n\nAnd as for the room itself, very nice. The bathroom has a large tub, tv has free HBO, free wi-fi, microwave and refrigerator. Everything looks pretty modern and up to date.\n\nThe per diem was within my company's approved list because of the affordability so it's most likely going to be in your company's approved list as well, so if you happen to be near the west Phoenix area, I would recommend this hotel. It's close to many restaurants and shopping centers and all within walking distance too. It's location is right off the 10 freeway.
5	Needed a quick bite in Scottsdale so I used the Yelp app and swung by this place.  I was a little taken aback by the location but once we got inside, it was nothing but goodness.  We had the pizza hoagie with potato salad.  Amazing.  The potato salad was nice and tangy with no celery, just the way I like it.  The pizza hoagie came with a generous amount of cheese and delicious tomato sauce.\n\nStaff was super friendly and helpful.  Definitely a keeper.\n\nCash only!
3	-Smaller Scrapbook store with lots of stuff.\n\n-Older stuff in clearance basket, some decent deals.\n\n-Good selection of scrapbook stuff, alittle bit of everything by theme.\n\n-Big classroom area with lots of workspace, about 1/4 of the store.\n\n-Good selection of tools in the classroom part of the store.\n\n-Prices alittle higher than other Scrapbook stores.\n\n-Sometimes friendly. One lady is not very friendly, maybe she is not a happy sister?\n\n-Clean restroom.\n\n-Convenient parking.\n\n-It's like a Circle K of Scrapbook stores, but not a place I would buy all my stuff.
5	Z Pizza I love you.  Screw Bianco's.  You are the best pizza joint in my book.  Every time I go, I get something fresh and delicious.  I used to always make custom calzones which were always to die for, but I mysteriously switched to pizza one day, and I haven't looked back.  After a bark at the park day I decided to try some of their pepperoni pizza that they had out and it was sooooo good.  That's all I get now.  The pepperoni is just perfectly spicy and the cheese is delicious and gooey.  Isn't that what pizza should be like?  Oh yeah, the crust.  I don't really like pizza crust unless I can cover it in ranch, but there is something about the crust here that is so good.  It's light and kind of fluffy.  It's substantial but not too thick.  Yum.  Plus, I can walk to this place from my house in like 5 minutes.  Score.  Thank you ZPizza for opening downtown, you made my dreams come true.
5	I can not believe it took me this long to write an update on this place!  \n\nLove, love , love...are the words to describe my feelings for you (Sens:) \n\nI was there friday night and the place was packed...in  good way.  Lots of people gazing during our food grazing!\nThe food did not disappoint.  They changed up their menu since the last time I was there and I have to say, the whole experience was even better than the first.\nI had the edamame with truffle butter, Pad Thai (Sens way) Noodles with crispy tofu, Kurobuta pork sausage with papaya slaw, White ginger fish, and for dessert, sweet wontons with a peach cream sauce.\nOh so good! \nWhat was slightly better than the food?!? Their sake list..amazing.  \nOver 100 different kinds...I was in heaven...I had the Kissui Chrysenthenum Mist Genshu.  It was a great balance of flavor, slightly sweet, med dry.  Perfect accompliment to the food.  I will be back, this time I won't wait too long;)
1	Bathrooms are filthy (please look at the inches of black dust blanketing the air vents...) and literally ten degrees (perhaps to give shelter to the countless homeless that flock in here during the heat waves?), the (new) cafe manager is obsessed with forcing her employees to ask customers not to let their flip flops hang off their feet (?!), the cafe insists on freezing their customers at around 40-50 degrees (really, I'm not exaggerating), many homeless people camp here the whole day and you have very few places you can sit without your olfactory senses being overwhelmed. Overall, very dirty and uncomfortable.
5	This is my favorite restaurant in the valley, and my husband agrees!\n\nToday I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) with a side of steamed Kale. AWESOME! (Although next time I will ask for no mayo, and was that parmesean on the Kale? Delicious, but I avoid dairy, and try to eat vegan.) Omni hubby went vegan with the steamed vegetables and farro (wheat berries). \n\nA few months back, we had Sunday brunch there, and I had the scrambled tofu and soy chorizo wrap, which was also very good. \n\nMy only complaint is the popularity of this place means that there is a wait for lunch, even on a 115-degree day. Also, because of the utliltarian kitchen decor and the crowd, it can be noisy. But the food and the service will keep me coming back.
5	My favorite local cafe!  So much personality!  It has that whole industrial, arty urban chic vibe going on.  Cool local art on the walls.  Always great music on (sometimes a little loud, so if you're easily distracted or trying to chat don't sit right under the speakers).  Amazing home-baked tasty little goodies -- something different every day!  Usually with vegan alternatives, and at least one reasonably healthy choice, including fresh fruit.  Just had their no-bake chocolate-peanut butter-oatmeal cookies -- which were seriously yum!  Still my favorite is the ciabatta-style toasted bread with real butter and Nutella alongside one of their perfect soy lattes...- heaven!  And yes, they do roast their own coffee beans here, so if you come in during roasting time, you may leave smelling like freshly roasted coffee!
3	I have never been a fan of David's Bridal to be honest. I stayed far away when planning my own wedding because most stores felt like being in a warehouse of generic styles (at least for bridesmaids dresses, to each his own for wedding dresses I suppose). This location is different, if only they could all be as nice as this one. Granted, it is a former Priscilla of Boston but it definitely made DB seem more upscale.\n\nThe best friend and I went in search of a dress for an upcoming wedding she is to be part of. The staff at this location were very nice and answered any questions we had. The fitting rooms were beautiful, with plenty of room, would be great for entire bridal parties trying on dresses together. The bestie found a breathtaking Vera Wang draped floor length dress. She ordered it and it came in less than 3 weeks later! Very speedy and not at all like the reputation DB has had in the past. Be wary of the alterations, from some other friends' experiences it seems that is where the delays are. As with anything wedding related, plan ahead!\n\nThere are still some other great Bridal stores in the Valley I definitely recommend over David's Bridal but if you are in a wedding where the bride has chosen DB or only need a special occasion dress, this is the best location I've found.
3	"""I should preface this review by stating that I am not a vegetarian. I am especially not vegan. I am a shameless meat and diary eater. But I am open to experimenting with different cuisines and always looking to try \healthier\"""" foods. Green is a restaurant that I've driven by countless times and always tell myself that I should give it a try. I finally did last night, and I wasn't terribly disappointed. While it's still not food that I would go out of my way for, I appreciate the level of quality Green offers. \n\nI decided to take an adventurous route and try the original \""""g\"""" spicy po-boy. I consider this adventurous because the idea of mock chicken doesn't sit well with me. The real thing tastes better and the health differential is open to debate. The sandwich was decent but small. It's only a po-boy in spirit. If you've ever been to New Orleans and had a po-boy, you'd know that they are obnoxiously oversized and stuffed with lettuce, tomato, and your choice of fish or meat. What saves this sandwich is the sauce. It's perfectly hot and the tofu absorbs all of its wonderful flavor. I like that Green uses mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce. It may take away the crunchiness, but I like the taste much better. Green also goes light on the mayo, which I appreciate. The thyme fires are really good. They're thin and crispy, and the herb really enhances the flavor. They give you a lot of fries, which makes up for the sandwich being a little undersized, but I'd rather have more sandwich than fries. \n\nSince heaven forbid I be strong enough to pass up on sweets, I also tried a peanut butter chocolate bar. Not bad. But certainly not worth its $3 asking price. It reminds me of a store-bought peanut butter rice crispy treat. I recommend only having this if you are a strict vegan. \n\nThe restaurant is exactly what you'd expect it to look like. It's dark and artsy in a hipster bohemian style that you'd find in New York's West Village. It's semi-service. Order at the counter, wait at the table, and someone brings you your food. Green may want to look into assigning their customers a number, or a pager, to place on the table. Even though I was taking my order to go, I'm not a big fan of someone walking around and yelling names (way too fast food for me). They also may want to put their menus out near the front the place. They're all at the counter and there isn't a big menu board posted. How is someone new supposed to have a clue what's on your menu if they can't see it until they make it the place where you order? \n\nA meat eater reviewing a vegetarian restaurant is like a vegan reviewing a steakhouse. I can appreciate the place for what it is, but it's just not designed for me. Green caters to a specific clientele that needs more restaurant options like this. I'm glad that there is a place like Green in the valley. It's everything that people who live this lifestyle can ask for. If you're a meat eater hoping for something that tastes just like \""""normal\"""" food, you're obviously going to be disappointed. I'm certainly open to giving Green another try, and would even suggest it if I were planning on dining out with a vegan or vegetarian friend."""""""
5	The baguettes are incroyable, incredible, fantastic, amazing.  They have a hint of sweetness, are not rock hard, and I couldn't stop eating them.\n\nI saw literally every single person in the place drinking an iced coffee.  I absolutely had to order one if everyone else was.  I was not disappointed.  In fact, I had the best iced coffee of my life.  There was something about it.  It was strong but not black, dirty, bitter, weak, or sour.  Mixed with a hint of condensed milk and poured over an entire cup of crushed ice, this iced coffee was amazing.
4	Most of us know what a shimmy is. Right? Upper torso, moving quickly back and forth, usually in a dance number. Hopefully a hot chick with equally hot boobies. Yes, I said boobies. Sure sign of my gayness. But a shim? How many of you know what a shim is? Hmmm? A shim is a small wooden plank I use to steady a wobbly table. And I looked high and low for these babies. Finally, I found them at Home Depot. Now, I have to agree with Calamari F. , navigating construction riddled Central Avenue is easier than getting in, finding a parking spot, and getting out of this disastrous slab of asphalt. Employees have always been helpful. I also get Velcro straps to tie back drapes here. Two teeny tiny little items in a massive sea of plywood, glass and doors and Delores (yes, she had a tool belt and mullet. Really. ) was able to find them quickly. I still prefer Ace Hardware. But Home Depot came through and steadied and neatened my world.
5	"""So, up until tonight, I've primarily used Yelp as a dating website. A girl thinks my picture is kinda cute. I write reviews that demonstrate I passed high school English. She writes/compliments me... I'm cocky/funny. I offer to explore downtown with her. She turns me down. I try the next girl. Same result. But the intent is always there. After this review, I doubt I'll have to worry about succeeding with any woman who ever reads this review ever again. \n\nSo check it out. I'm a male slut. If I meet you in person and I lay my lines on you and smile in this certain way that I've discovered makes women look away and blush, you'll definitely give me your number and probably go home with me within one more encounter. That's my M.O. It works. If it ain't broke... \n\nI'm not altogether proud of the man I've become but I'm not going to stop either. From what I've gathered from movies and television, my life is fairly wonderful. Unless me writing about it causes some cosmic/karmic shift and I get disfigured in a car accident tomorrow and lose my mojo, I have several strong years of carousing left in me.  \n\nOk, all that said, I've been reading on Yelp about all the \cougars\"""" who frequent this lovely establishment. I define a \""""cougar\"""" not by age, but as a woman who knows what she wants (me). So my buddy, who's also a man about town and similarly successful in this field, and I decide that this is our new watering hole. We've been there twice in the last two weeks. Guess how many woman we've taken home or who have taken us to their homes in the last two weeks? Four. Guess how many we've given The Business to... The same four. Guess what our batting average is... .1000\n\nUsually, I need to take a woman out one more time before The Business is exchanged. Sometimes more if she's particularly prudish. Barcelona is where The Business is the understood currency. I like The Business. So if you're reading this and you think I'm scum, I used to be you. I've \""""evolved.\"""" If you're reading this and you're a woman who knows what she wants, shoot me a message. And if you're reading this you think I'm lying because you didn't get laid last time you went there, I am willing to show you how. But you'd never take my advice because you don't believe me or think you'll succeed next time on your own or think I'm an ass for writing this and you don't want to meet me on principle. I don't blame you. I feel dirty. But just a little. Mostly smug."""""""
2	I love Cuban food. Moved here from Miami and lived on Cuban food there...authentic Cuban food. Went to Havana Cafe yesterday and was very excited. The atmosphere was not bad. It was around two in the afternoon so it was empty. Very nice staff. The menu is interesting, but it is not true Cuban food, but a their version of Cuban recipes.  I have to say that the food was just okay. The presentation was nice, but the food itself was without flavor all together.  The quality of the products used were good, but missing the flair of true caribbean flavor.  Unfortunately I will not be going back to Havana Cafe. My search for Cuban food in the valley continues.
4	"""\So I'm guessing truffles are kinda like tomatoes?\""""\n\n\""""No, boyfriend. It's a kind of mushroom\""""\n\nEven after waiting in line for 15mins (gets packed here cos all the office people come out) We couldn't decide between the truffle fries, sweet potato fries or the zucchini straws so we got all of them. Our piggy asses stuffed each light, crispy and bursting with flavor chip into our holes dipping in all the different sauces waiting for our meaty burgers. All of which have their own distinct smell and all are just as good. I say everyone picks a side - and share.\n\nNeedless to say - $16ish for a burger is a lot of money. I got the kobe one with mushrooms and swiss, while boyfriendy got the normal cheeseburger. While both the burgers were grilled to our desires (mine, medium rare that's cool and pink in the middle and boyfriendy's medium well's brown) I'm pretty sure we could get the same effect with Costco's burger patties and my Dad's cooking skills.\n\nWe missed out on the dessert because we were just stuffed from the burger and fries - they messed up on an order of salad and charged us for a cheaper one (should have been free!) and we sat outside by the mist-ti-fiers before heading out to Paradise cookie.\n\nOverall - good location, they validate your parking, kinda-sexpensive and not overall healthy. BUT - a gourmet burger joint is a gourmet burger joint and not one to miss if you're in the area."""""""
4	I've been to this location quite a few times. When I am in the mood, I love their food. I recommend the roadies. They are sliders served on the rolls they serve at the beginning of the meal. Yummmmm. Last time I was there, we also ordered the appetizer combo. That was fabulous as well. \n\nThe service isn't memorable, never great but never bad either. The keep your drinks full and bring your food quickly but nothing exceptional. \n\nSo far I have received decent service and delicious food. If you'd in the mood for roadhouse type food, make a stop here!
5	Came here when it opened on Saturday morning around 11:15 am (they open at 11 am). We thought we give it a try since my daughter's dance class was 3 miles away. We have experienced the revolving sushi before at a different location in AZ (in Chandler), but thought, this one is closer so why not give it a try?\n\nThis place is smaller than Teharu, but definitely had more seating around the revolving sushi belt. We were quickly seated when we arrived. The waiter was extremely nice and brought us our drinks quickly. \n\nOne thing I noticed quickly is that they had the color of the plates and the prices very well broadcast in the restaurant. We had a couple of things: seaweed salad (yum), rainbow roll, dragon roll, shrimp sushi, squid sushi, etc. Everything was great - and seemed fresh (since we were there when they opened). They were also VERY quick when I wanted something I didn't see. The sushi chef made it a priority to get me what I wanted, instead of having me wait, which was a plus.  \n\nAt the end of our meal, our hostess came by and chatted with me. I had previously told the waiter that it was our first time and we saw the recommendation on Yelp. She was fascinated and asked if this was our first revolving sushi experience, how we thought of the place, etc. She even gave us a 10% off card for our next visit, which was nice. Definitely come here again.
5	Gammage is a wonderful venue for huge musicals!  \n\nLast week, I got to see Mama Mia, thank you Yelp for the complimentary tickets.  We sat in Row 24 , Seats 46/48 and we had a great view of the stage. The people next to us left before the 2nd half, what the french toast!  It's Mama Mia! \n \nI've gone to Lion King, by myself and sat in row 13 in the middle and it's just as good, if not better.  \n\nI actually went to ASU, and performed on that very stage and love the fact that not only do big names perform there but also local performers and ASU students etc.\n\nYes, parking is not great, but really is it anywhere?  I usually go early enough to find parking, around 6 or 6:30ish and hang out, have a drink and just chill.  Even after the show, just wait about 20 to 30 minutes and you avoid a lot of the traffic.\n\nGammage is an unique building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and if you are visiting the Phoenix area, it is a place to consider checking it out.
4	It's about time I write a review for Malee's!  After all, I've been more times than I can count... in addition to the Yelp event (which was fantastic), I've been to Malee's in large groups, small groups, and solo.  I've also done take-out various times including tonight!  \n\nI love the Desert Ridge location because they have sushi in addition to a really large thai menu.  It's great because you can order edamame, seaweed salad, or sushi appetizers and then get a thai entree... or you can get a thai appetizer and sushi dinner.  (I'm a big fan of mixing and matching!)  I also like that Malee's is open to substitutions in dishes if necessary.  Some of my favorite thai appetizers are the siamese kisses and summer rolls.  I also enjoy the pad thai, and all of the vegetarian options.\n\nAs of tonight, I have a new favorite dish at Malee's... the thai basil curry clam house special.  It's a mouthful, but it's awesome!  I ordered it with medium spice and had them add veggies.  Wow.  Phenomenal!  I was happy it came with rice (your choice of white or brown) because I sopped up the broth with the rice... and I have to admit, I thought about drinking the extra broth too - it was that good!\n\nService is usually great and everyone is friendly at Malee's.  By far the BEST thai food in the area, and the best restaurant in the Desert Ridge shopping mall.  The only suggestions I have are these:  please add an eggplant entree or at least allow me to add eggplant to the dish I choose to order, and perhaps a thai garden salad with peanut dressing.  Other than that, Malee's rocks and still supports my theory that I was thai in a past life.  See you again soon, Malee's!
5	This was my first time going to this establishment. It came recomended to me by my co-worker who's brother went almost everyday while living here and in high school down the road. I had to go to the costume shop just next door and she told me to look for this place. Thought I would give it a try.\n\nAfter reading several reviews on Yelp, it helped me to decide this was the place to get my lunch. I walked in and Tina was eager to welcome me and quickly take my order. I mentioned that it was my first time and knew they were a cash only establishment so I wanted to make sure I stayed within the cash that I had on hand.\n\nGot a half Italian with onion and just the way they make it. Nothing extra or added. DELISH!!! The aroma from the oil blended with the herbs were the first thing that I smelt when opening the sandwich. The bread was soft and contents were fresh!\n\nI opted to get a side of potato salad from reading the reviews of it. OMG!!! I don't know that anything can take me away from NOT ordering that every time I come back. The potatoes are cut almost like an au gratin type cut which makes it so nice and filling (even with the small cup that you are served). It was creamy and the blend of sweet and tart made it just a wonderful delight!! Who doesn't love a good potato salad!\n\nNext I got a cannolli. Being born on Long Island, New York and going back to visit family, that every time you go you have to visit the bakery to get fresh cannollies to bring them home to the parents back in Arizona. THIS CANNOLLI WAS EVERYTHING THE REVIEWS SAID THEY WERE. The cream was just sweet enough filled all the way though the shell (the way it should be!!!) and creamy as can be. PERFECTION!!! I just found my new place to get my parents their craving for New York style cannollies!\n\nWhen I get the craving for a sandwich, I'll be putting this place on the map of go to places first!! To get all that I did on just over $7.00 for lunch it was perfect!\n\nMy co-worker is now planning on visiting for dinner for her and her husband tomorrow night on her way home!
5	Only eaten here once or twice and it was so-so.\n\nI really come here for the dancing and drinking!  I've never had a bad time here.  There's definitely something for everyone here.  You can sit in a booth or at the bar inside OR you can go outside.  They have it like a beachy bar.  There's a bar, cabanas and tables/chairs in the sand!  They also have a little water pool area thing that you can walk in and get your feet wet.  There are always interesting and fun people here and it's a great place to meet someone new.  I like to take my out of town friends here.  It's so different!
4	NEEDS A CUSTOMER FACING DISPLAY FOR THEIR POINT OF SALE SYSTEM. The staff here is WONDERFUL, and the OWNER IS ALWAYS HERE, yes that's right, if you come here often, you have the pleasure of meeting Lenny himself.\n\nBut one major flaw is that they need a display on their point of sale system showing you what you have ordered before you pay (just like their Glendale location), because I have had my order messed up more than quite a few times here, usually they forget my extra french fries, or place everything in the world on my cheese burger, when I only wanted the cheese, meat, and bun.\n\nOther than that, I don't really have anything negative to say about this place. I love the staff, and if the right person is at the register, they remember my order and the negative points I have made above is negated.
5	If this isn't love than I don't know what is! I headed off for a Cubs game on my spring break, thanking the lucky starts I had entered the field of education, complete with bottom of the barrel salaries and a lifetime of spring breaks!\nI had briefly looked up a few stadiums around town after listening to others go on and on about how great this 'spring training' in Phoenix gig is.  We decided on Hohokam mainly for the team (my boyfriend is a Cubs fan), and secondly for the stadium, supposedly complete with Chicago style dogs and old style brew.  \n\nWhen we arrived I noticed herds of people happily walking from far away parking lots for the sold-out game.  Sold out! On a Thursday for spring training! Yes it's true but luckily we scored 3 lawn seats (just what I was looking for a grassy spot in the sun), for just over double the $6 face value.  After beering up and finding our perfect spot I proceeded to watch not a second of baseball.  However, I did use the innings as a measure of when I should get another beer, or checkout the Italian sausage sandwich, and yes I have been craving it everyday since!\n\nSpring training is a blast I HIGHLY recommend it for all!
3	The hubby's employer held an event here. We didn't stay overnight so can't comment on the rooms, but as we were driving the 1.5 miles from the main entrance to the convention center lobby, I found myself thinking I would love to come back and explore the grounds.  It's absolutely beautiful, secluded and private. While we were waiting in line to check in, they served us h'or d'oeuvres. Thought that was pretty neat.\n\nI had two margaritas, and unfortunately the beers were stronger. Tasted like fruity lemonade. Disappointing- was it because I had a drink ticket? Dinner was a buffet, with chicken and steak as the main dishes, and it was also so-so. I should have filled up on their salad (with peppercorn ranch dressing) and bread because those were the best items. I hope it's not what they serve in their restaurant, because it definitely wouldn't be worth the price. The service was the best part, and it was pretty top-notch. \n\nI would like to stay here someday, would be a nice get-away. I'm sure things are better if you are an actual guest of the resort versus part of some corporate party.
1	Hospice of the Valley for someone with dementia. They will drug your loved one up so much that they fall into a comma and then 10 to 15 days later will die of dehydration. Although your loved one's quality of life was zero there is a difference for the person that signed the paperwork allowing it to happen and when God allows it to happen. End of life care is hard on the person who signs and people should know this is what they are signing before it happens.
1	The first warning sign should have been the fact that this place was practically dead at 9 pm on a Saturday night. From previous Yelpers, I was prepared for the complete and total lack of authenticity for a so-called Irish pub... but I was not prepared for cold food and having to constantly fend off the drunk and/or homeless people who unabashedly walk right up to the table and brazenly harass you or ask for your leftovers. Some may find this kitschy. I do not. \n\nReally, this place deserves less than one star. It gets a quarter-star for our poor server, who seemed sweet and somewhat embarrassed about the goings-on. It gets another quarter-star for the seasoned waffle fries, which were probably totally delicious when they were hot.\n\nBleh.
5	"""What a lovely dinner at NOCA , not only is the food really tasty and fresh but the service is wonderful .  I am overall impressed with the smoothness and finesse of the staff. We noticed that without being intrusive or cloying the staff seemed to notice and respond to our needs. \nI was amazed how each staff member was responsible for different elements of the serving. One person brought the amuse bouche , a different person refilled water, a different person brought cotton candy ( yes cotton candy, it works) waiter took order and oversaw our dinner, host responded to request , ended meal and smoothly transitioned our exit,  well done . \n\nThe food was really good , the amuse bouche was.. should we say ...amusing.  so much so that we had to ask again to find our what is was...watermelon and radish \something\""""..and it worked. \n\nWe ordered the Tartar which was my favorite for the evening ,  a lovely nibble of handsomely seasoned raw tuna , capers added to the taste with toast rubbed with truffle oil I believe.. super. \n\nSalad was the low point, if you can say that , heirloom tomatoes with a light oil and seasoning,  salad with ummm something unremarkable. \n\nMy entree was a skirt steak very tasty and a potato cake reminiscent of a hash brown but much better.  I had to dodge the spinach ..but husband said it was great. \n\nPlus 1 had the Halibut with a yummy sauce that was good yet I could quite place the reddish seasonings..I love a challenge.. he also had rosti potatoes , one of our favorites. \n\nRaspberry cotton candy swirled into a light cylinder shape came to our table like a blue  cloud of \""""ta-da\"""" to finish the meal.  We didn't eat  it but it sure looked pretty. \n\nI was fascinated by dessert, a mango thin pudding , with coconut sorbet topped with a thin cracker of hardened meringue ..it looks childish at first, my first thought , I am so going to get Gelato after... but then you eat them spooned together and it's this lovely taste sensation , very delicate and symbiotic.. who would have thought it? \n\nI really was impressed if you can't tell. I definitely will be back . Can't wait to try a Sunday Supper!"""""""
4	I am so happy they finally opened a new gym up my way. The old one on Northern was small, cramped and the dance room was wide open and made it hard to concentrate in class. \n\nThe parking lot might be packed, but there are so many machines and equipment and free weight/stretching areas that you never feel cramped. I am always able to use any machine I want, no waiting, even on a Saturday at noon. No parking issues like some other locations (cough Camelback cough). The treadmills, elliptical, bikes and stairs have personal TVs that you can hook your headphones into to listen, AND you can plug your iPhone in to charge in the machine. Awesome!\n\nThey have a child care area and a nice locker room. No juice bar though. No sweat off my back, i never got one, but if you do care, its kind of a bummer. \n\nI can't wait to go back tonight!
4	This is one of my favorite lunch spots. Their pizza is great! Their salads are packed full of the good stuff, with the best house dressing around. The staff are very friendly and my favorite part is you are asked what you want to drink right away and don't forget the glasses are HUGE! There is nothing worse in restaurants than small glasses and the impossibility of getting a refill!\n\nI have ordered many different kinds of pizza from this Nellos and have yet to be disappointed. The buffalo chicken pizza is so tasty and they will give you extra buffalo sauce and ranch all you have to do is ask. They will make you pizza any way you like it and the wait is never that long. I am always able to keep my lunch at an hour, which of course makes my boss happy!\n\nDon't forget the salads that come piled high with meat, cheese and tons of veggies, you never feel you paid too much for a salad once you dig in! Their dressing is pinkish orange and just superb! \n\nIn a part of town that is lacking great places to eat lunch, I am glad Nello's is in my neighborhood!
5	The roasted corn pizza was absolutely delicious! And, the LGO chips and dips plate (guacamole, salsa, & pimento dip) as an appetizer was amazing! The grocery shop next door is very pleasant as well... Lots of cute items and yummy desserts! Aside from Phoenix, AZ apparently there are other LGO locations in Santa Monica and Pasadena... Wish there was one in NorCal! In summary, this place is fantastic!\n\nThe only con: this place is always busy... However, the wait is so worth it!
5	Ahh...I love this place....such a great place to shop for cheap manga....\nthis is were i buy most of my series...such as Negima or Bleach...\nThe scent of tear-and-wear paper is in the air...such a delightful aroma to a cheap bookworm as myself...because i know i can afford the books...\nThe manga and books are half-off their original retail price, which is a really good deal. They also sell magazines,video games,dvds, anime, cds, soundtracks,action figures,plushies,and other collectibles that are located in the back of the store. I always come here every time i have cash in hand...and off i go! So all you need is about twenty bucks and you can buy yourself a smorgasbord of books or items...
5	I'm lucky enough to latch on to my in-laws trip to the Four Seasons Scottsdale every April.  The service is consistently beyond exceptional, but you're going to pay for it.\n\nPrices for lunch at the Residence Club pool are less than at the main pool, and the food is just as good.  Lunch at Crescent Moon is also great - entrees are big enough to share.\n\nIf you can take the heat, try to come in May or September.  You can get great rates and the heat isn't too bad except for at its peak.
5	Fabuloso.  This is my kind of place.  I love everything from the great candle smell when you walk in to all of the knickknacks that you want, but don't really need.  \n\nThere was really cool note cards that made me wish I sent more thank you cards so I could justify the purchase, but who knows, maybe I'll find a use for them yet.  One of my favorite items was a book of shopping lists that had been found and bound into a clever, entertaining read (with organized chapters!).  The slang flashcards had me laughing along with many other great novelty items.  There are also fun vases, books, and all sorts of random gifty items.  I enjoyed my short time going through the mish-mash of inventory and I hope you do the same.  I will definitely be back and leave with a purchase next time.
1	"""I used to be a regular here.  I'd always get take out on the days I worked (around 10:30 pm) and go there on my days off with friends.  When I moved about 6 months ago I stopped getting food from here because it was a little too far.  Now I'm back in the area and even though it was only 6 months I decided it was still probably a good idea to check and see when they close\n\nSo I called at 7:30-8pm and the nice little lady said that they didn't close until \midnight\"""".  WONDERFUL :)\n\nSo I get there at 10:30, and they're all locked up with the lights off!!  So after inspecting the place for a minute I walk back to my car and run into the employees!  Guess they randomly decided to close early!  In my eyes that is just one very rude way of telling your customers to EFF off and that you don't care about them.\n\nGREAT JOB EARLS!  I won't be going there to waste my money on a business ran by idiots that can't seem to know that midnight is 12am, not 10:30 pm!!"""""""
4	"""I have ate here more than a few times and let me tell you if I can quote the great Samuel L. Jackson \This is one tasty burger\"""". They are called Butter burgers but its only the bun that has the butter on it but it does bring out the flavor for sure. The burger is what they do best here along with the custard. The onion rings are also a great side to pair with the burger, they are thick and delicious. If you are going here for something else such as fish, chicken or salad they do that here as well but not as good as the burgers. One of my favorites places to cool down in the summer heat. Come here and grab a bite."""""""
4	Just had a bday dinner here last night, and the food was amazing!\n\nCripsy Calamari - 4 stars! It's more like a salad of Mizuna leaves with a light Yuzu dressing tossed with crispy calamaris. The golden-colored calamaris were crispy and tasty, and with the combination of mizuna is just mouthwatering!\n\nBacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin - 5 stars! I'm just going to admit that this is very of the best pork tenderloin i've had for a long time! The juicy sliced meat with a bit of smoked bacon flavor on a bed of parsnip puree, hmm, heaven! \n\nScallops with 'forbidden' rice - 4 stars. I really like the 'forbidden' rice (aka black rice, just like brown rice, it's very healthy!) in accompanied with the seared scallops. Somehow I felt the scallops were not cooked as evenly as I thought it should be, maybe because it was lined on chive(?) skewer?\n\nThe only reason made me take off a star was the service. Our waitress somehow didn't show up after like 10 mins wait although the table next us who came later than us got served immediately, at least have someone to take a drink order? The place doesn't look busy, it was disappointing to have slow service on a Wednesday night. \n\nI'd definitely go back just for the calamaris and the pork tenderloin!
3	The Daily Dose is a solid brunch spot in Scottsdale. Their was a wait when we went but we quickly seated in a large booth. They have a huge menu and it took me a while to decide what I wanted to order but I went with the breakfast nachos which were absolutely enormous and he went with pancakes. My nachos were eggy and cheesy and yummy came with a gravy on the side which was good for dipping. All in all a solid spot to have a huge brunch or possibly come for after work drinks and food if I lived here.
4	Delicious! I went here today with my friend because we were looking for something light for lunch. We decided to try China Lite because she heard that they offer quite a few healthy choices on the menu. Not only was the service friendly and prompt, the food was yummy! I will definitely be going back, today I had the Mongolian chicken, but that is just because I didn't see the spicy eggplant dish. My friend had the Thai chicken and said she enjoyed it very much.
5	What can't I say that's great about this place? The menu is simple and has exactly what a pizza connoisseur like myself needs, simple, delicious toppings, however I want it, and in sizes that will actually fill me up and make me not have spasms of hunger in my small intestine. My order came out faster than I could bake a Digiorno, and I loved every single delicious, cooked to perfection slice I consumed. To top off my experience, the service from our server Alexis was perfect, she was attentive, knowledgable, and had recommendations that were a hit with the family. She even recommended a wine my wife now makes me pick up every time I'm at the store. Couldn't rave more about the restaurant and especially the service, there will definitely be more 5 star meals consumed at my new favorite pizzeria.
3	"""Frank & Lupe's is like the melding of two worlds. Good ol' America and Mexico, you're thinking, huh? Not exactly. I'm talking about one world with good service and another world with not-so-good service. Which world you land in, and, thus, the type of service you receive depends solely on you.\n\nI've been to Frank & Lupe's maybe four or five times. Once was a visit to the Santos Lounge portion of the property. You can read up on that venture on your own. All other times, except once, I've been drawn to the backyard patio. This is Scottsdale, after all, and great weather demands that we remain outdoors to celebrate it. The problem is that the patio is found in the world of not-so-good service.\n\nFrank & Lupe's tends to draw large groups. Many times, those groups are made up of tourists. Being tourists, they usually want to sit outside because they are from far off places where \outside\"""" is no farther away than the garage. That's okay. But be prepared for a bit of a wait while said tourists stretch out and make this place their own. You should also be prepared for the somewhat frenetic pace that comes when servers wait on large groups --- especially large groups of tourists. It can be dizzying. Or, maybe it was the hunger that was making me dizzy.\n\nServers will come and go. They'll go to other tables. They will eventually come to your table and take your order. It is done with a smile and friendly feel. But then they will go to other tables and leave you with an empty glass and a mouth dry from the basket of chips you gorged on. A possible solution might be to order one of those beer buckets. Another solution is to snag a table inside where the world of good service is to be found.\n\nAfter always venturing to the patio and always receiving sub-par service, I figured it was time to try inside. What a difference it made. We were seated and waited on immediately and proceeded to get the greatest service I had ever had at Frank & Lupe's. I never got his name, but I think he works behind the bar sometimes. So efficient was the service that we were wiping our mouths and settling the tab before we even made a dent in the night. A stroll through the galleries during Art Walk helped take care of that, though.\n\nThe bottom line here is that the food is pretty good and the service is great ... or not so great, depending on your chosen world."""""""
3	I was let down by yelp.  As someone that travels to new cities non-stop and is always trying new 4.5+ yelp reviews this place is a definite miss.  The salad starter was outstanding and I was expecting the same.  The venison was requested medium rare and was provided overcooked.  We returned it and received another slightly less overcooked venison.  The ahi tuna's texture and flavor were both off (I am extremely familiar with raw fish).  The steak special was a good cut of beef but oversalted.  Maybe it's good for AZ, but in LA, this place wouldn't last a year.
4	"""Okay, come on. It's 18 and over, yes it's going to be lame and cheesy, but hey, we don't go there because its classy and upscale. \n\nIt's a simple club. Dance floor in the middle, bar in the back, upstairs exclusively for the 21 and over crowd, and a couple of seating area's to the side. \n\nYeah, the crowd is a little \ghetto\"""". Got a lot of skanks and wanna-be pimps, but hey, they're everywhere. The music is mostly the \""""mainstream\"""" radio stuff that you'll find on 101.5, because they play the same music on that station that they play in the club on Friday nights. I can't complain too much about it. Gotta please the public, and right now, that's what's pleasing the majority of the public. \n\nThis place is fun, as long as you bring your own people. If you're going there to look for a hottie, you're bound to be disappointed. (Unless you like ghetto =] )"""""""

2	Nice little Mexican joint in North Scottsdale - puff puff pass please wink!  Literally, just pass.  Parking is limited for such large place so I wonder what happens during rush hour, or maybe they didn't expect any rush!  The food - tacos, nachos, chimichungas, etc....nothing too impressive, but I can't say I was dissatisfied.  I didn't expect much so I wasn't too disappointed.  I ordered a couple of drinks and maybe I should have ordered more to drown out the sorrow of this experience!  Our service was good at least I can say, but then again we were one of the two customers around :(  - Enjoy...or not.
4	Okay I really wanted to not like this place.  I did not go for dinner.  With a crew of 8, I went to the Sunday Brunch.  $10.00 bottomless champagne. I repeat $10.00 bottomless refills.  Okay truth be told it's sparkling wine but who cares.  They refill pretty regularly.  You'll be tipsy enough that you won't care that they charge $12.00 a carafe for juice in the event you want to make your own Bellini or Mimosa.  \nThe brunch menu is pretty varied and is surprisingly reasonable.  The scones are mini-scones and are delicious.  It does come with Devonshire cream and jam on the side as they should.  The eggs benedict are some of the best.  Truffled hollandaise was a nice touch.  Go for the regular eggs benedict and not necessarily the short ribs.  The regular ones really are the best flavored.  The bacon is good, if you want to be really decadent go for the pork belly.  It is fatty goodness.\nThe stuffed french toast was more of a large warm jelly-doghnut, not in a bad way.  But if you like decadent French toast go for the french toast at Frank and Albert's.\nThe vibe is very Vegas, or to compare to a place locally, think of Modern Steak at Fashion Square.  Perfect for bachelorette parties.  Purple walls, plush lounges, glass and mirrors everywhere.  The men folk we were with thoroughly enjoyed their experience.  There are many Scottsdale types perfect for people watching.
4	This restaurant was a treat.  Having just moved from NYC, we are having a hard time finding restaurants that meet our standards.  This place was a delight to our taste buds! \nI enjoyed their home made pasta with sausage- the red sauce and peppers were a nice touch and the dish was perfectly spiced.\nMatt had their scotch beef and it was tender and perfectly cooked- he described it at succulent with a flavorful burgundy sauce.\nThe real winner was their marscapone cheesecake- OMG! It was so amazing that we ordered one to go - to treat our babysitter/friend!\nA great date spot and the service was tasteful and impeccable.
3	There wasn't anything special about this grocery store to the others that I found in Florida. Outside that they have hard liquor in the same area. The produce could get much better and the cost is ok. I hate anyplace that asked you to get a card or number to save. But I guess it's a great way to keep people coming back. There just wasn't enough people on the floor to help. There actually didn't seem to be many employees in the store period. This was the closes to my brother's house which is probably the only reason he goes here.
4	3.5 Stars for food, 4 stars for service.\n\nFor what it is, this place is a good find in the Az area. The staff are REALLY nice. I ordered a noodle dish and then at last minute wanted a curry dish. They swapped my order without charging me the extra difference. I've had better food before, but for where we are and the quality, it's not too bad. My other friends enjoyed the food and feasted on this meal. I think my favorite was the walnut shrimp. I'd pass on ordering the curry again.
4	"""Had to wait almost 30 minutes on a Sunday morning and got only a counter seat at Over Easy. That's okay, it was worth it. A friend and I split a omelet with smoked salmon, asparagus and spinach and chose home fries. The omelet was tasty but a tad too salty. I'm not sure if it was the salmon or too much salt in the egg. The home fries were tasty but next time, I want to try the tater tots. We also split Reeses Pieces pancakes. At first, all I saw was a smattering of Reeses candies on top of three pancakes. I was like \That's it?\"""" But I turned one pancake over and was relieved to see there were candies in the batter. I know that was the least healthiest thing I could have ordered, but no other restaurant offers M&Ms or chocolate chips in pancakes. The pancakes were just right, the thickness of each cake with a soft inside. \n\nLove how they turned what was once a same-ol-same-ol fast food joint into a popular spot of home cooking. The staff seem friendly. While I was there, someone ordered the Big Easy of 12 eggs, 3/4 pound of bacon, home fries, etc. smothered in country gravy. That was one huge muthaf******. The whole staff came out to present it to the customer with the manager taking a picture, LOL. If one person finishes it in 30 min or less, it's free. I have no idea if they put a timer out there or what.\n\nAnyway, looks like there's a wait no matter when you go on the weekend. At least they have a canopy with some benches near by. I'd go here again as long as the wait is under half an hour."""""""
4	This past summer i attended the stadium and have to say it is really nice, the roof retracts and that was pretty cool to see and experience, the staff is really nice and the facility is very clean. A/C was freaking awesome since PHX heat is a bit too much to handle on some days, at least my time while in Phx.\n\nSeating in my section was a bit weird, seats were in a angle and sorta tight, i am sure there may be other areas much more comfortable, but time will only tell since i am sure this will not be my last time i attend this ballpark... \n\nGo Dodgers!
5	Don takes very good care of his clients, guided Alan to buy the right humidor for his big 50th B. day. Many shops will just let you pick...care less about if you are getting your money's worth ect. Don's is for the cigar connoisseur and maybe that is why some people have given poor reviews, he's not anal, he is there to help you in the humidor and pick the best cigar for what $ you wish to spend and if you let him...he will quickly advise you and educate you. My husband has been all over the valley and Don knows his product, has a huge inventory and really cares that you like what you buy. That is called customer service and rare in AZ. But if you look for that in a shop you will get it at Don's and he treats his big spenders and little ones like us (2-3) cigars at a time all the same...like your special. You can easily spend $3 Grand on some of his top of the line humidors so I gave it a high price but he also has some for $40.00. Happy Puffing.
4	Yes it is a chain, but in my experience it is predictably good Mexican food.  Had drinks and appetizer's with my woman here this afternoon.  Sat in the bar and saw some football while we ate and drank.\n\nShe liked her margarita, and she is not easy to please.   Salsa was good.  Food was a B, but nothing wrong with that.\n\nClean.  Friendly, prompt service.  Looks like it's thick adobe-like walls would be cooling in the summer heat.  A bit pricey for what we got, but that's Snotsdale for you.
5	This isn't your corner Starbucks by far.  It's small company that caters to it's repeat customers.  I've been going to Seattle Espresso for over ten years now and it's by far one of my favorite places to grab a drink.  My favorite is their Bella Mocha.  SE uses a bitter sweet chocolate sauce made by a Seattle company called Dilettante Chocolates. They also use cream (sorry health nuts - not your drink) that gives it a bit of a silky buttery taste mixed in with the bittersweet chocolate.  I would class it a Bittersweet Nirvana!  Starbucks's new Cocoa Cappuccino does not even compare to it and all it does is make me crave the Bella Mocha even more.  Another plus with SE is that they use an Italian Roast Coffee bean for it's espresso drinks.  Strong and full of flavor, and again this may not be your cup of Starbucks.   So if you like Italian roasted espresso and full flavored concoctions, give it a try!
4	First...it's a burger joint.  As with other of my reviews, the star rating here takes into consideration what the place is.  It is not Top of the Rock, or Delmonico's or anything like that.  It's a burger place.\n\nAnd the burgers are very good.  You can get a variety of preparations (teriyaki, bleu, A1, etc), or just get a regular burger.  The service has always been friendly, they offer bottomless fries with many menu choices, and the burgers are reasonable size.  Or if you want chicken, they have that too.  I have been here a few times and always get the burger.  Today was the A1 burger, and it was pretty good.  Their fries are bland (just a bit of salt), but the seasoning bottle on the table makes them really tasty.  Four of us ate for right at $50, which included one float and one large shake (which also was pretty good).\n\nGenerally, if I want a burger and don't feel like doing it myself, this is where I come.  They do a good job, and the endless fries are a nice bonus.
5	My wife and I had a date on Saturday and decided to try Vintage 95 again as the first time was awesome and his time lived up to the first or better.\nDespite being quite busy we managed to get a little table promptly. Our first thought was that it wasn't the greatest spot but actually the chairs were so comfortable and we had a view to all that was going on including the music so it really was great.\nOur server, sorry but I forgot his name, was very good and was very attentive. We ordered a bottle of wine, the brie pear & onion jam bruschetta appetizer and a grilled chicken panini sandwich.  Everything was wonderful (although the chicken panini wasn't truly a panini it was still delicious)!\nThey have a very diverse crowd from 20's to 60's, a great ambiance and delicious food.  And they take reservations!!!  We will definitely be back!\nThanks!
1	"""I swear the \four assed monkey\"""" from South Park is in charge of this place.\n\nWhen you have customers in front of you waiting on a pizza that's been sitting, here's a hint, HANG UP THE PHONE AND DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE WAITING TO GET THEIR FOOD!\n\nWe were there on the evening of May 7, 2012 around 8pm. First when we walked in there were two other customers sitting in the line, waiting for someone to come to the counter and give them their food. That took ten minutes. Then, before the idiot behind the counter could tend to us, she wandered off for another five minutes. When she finally got back, she took a phone call while running our card so we could get out of there. This took a total of 20 minutes. That's madness.\n\nThe pizza isn't good enough to justify our wait. Won't be going back. PPP should FIRE EVERYONE WHO WORKS HERE and start over. Bunch of half witted no whits."""""""

3	"""Oregano's runs hot and cold in my book. I've had great meals here (pizza, mostly), but I've also had a fair share of bland pastas and not-so-spectacular sandwiches. \n\nI keep coming back, however, because it's a fun, friendly place. I'm a big fan of their quirky shirts (today's read \legalize marinara\""""), and the servers are always smiling as they go about their business. Most everyone goes out of the way to make sure you're having a good experience (today, for instance, I was promised a donation of dozens of empty cans for the school at which I work). \n\nI'll be back, and I'm hoping to try the deep dish pizza soon."""""""
4	I have been coming to Susies for almost 19 years for 1 thing and 1 thing only...the green chili burrito! It is by far the best in the valley! My husband and I have tried tons of little Mexican restaurants in the valley just to compare the green chili burrito to Susies and Susies ALWAYS wins! The beans are heaven and the rice is pretty good too! I am honestly not sure of how anything else tastes on the menu! :-)
4	As other reviewers have stated, this is not true, authentic Mexican food. Macayo's, along with Top Shelf, serves the white people's version of Mexican food. Nothing too scary or spicy to freak us out, right?\nThat being said...it's Macayo's! Native Arizonans at least know about the chain, if not having been raised on their food. Yes, the decor is loud and obnoxious with bright colors and enormous parrot statues, but it's awesomely bad. Appreciate the eccentricity, people! The food is decent. It's a bit on the greasy side, but if you came in here expecting something healthy and easy on your stomach, that's your problem. I will say that the wait staff is unpredictable; they have a high turnover rate of employees except for the tiny woman who brings the chips and salsa who has been there for years. You could end up waiting a long time; my personal experience is that our food usually comes so damn fast that it startles me. One last thing: if you like your margaritas sweet, you won't like theirs. Always very tart. They're drinkable, but sour. They say they put triple sec in there but I'm calling shenanigans on that.
5	Dick's Hideaway has become the ritual brunch for a few of us who've taken up running weekend 5K's every few weeks. \n\nIs there any food substance in the state of Arizona that's tastier than the chorizo used to make the breakfast quesadillas here? Maybe a slice of Bianco's Wiseguy pizza. That's about it. As I sat here yesterday for brunch, I remarked to a friend that I couldn't wait until our next brunch here to have that quesadilla again, before the one on my plate was even finished. She felt exactly the same way. \n\nDid I mention the breakfast happy hour special of $5 bloody marys and mimosas? The bloody's come with a free shot of beer. \n\nBest breakfast spot in town, hands down.

The staff is small and caring and most have been with Encanto for years, which in my mind says alot about the ownership.\n\nThey have payment plans, through their office, and work with any type of financial situation.

5	I've now been to Noca a few times and it is hands down without a doubt my new favorite restaurant.  I can't even describe how phenomenal their food is, but it is expensive and to do it correctly, you are going to spend over $60 per person (especially if you consume any alcohol).  The menu is constantly evolving although they have a lobster special on Wednesday's and their version of a cheese steak on Thursday's, both of which are simply sublime.  On top of having the most sensational and creative food, the service is top notch and you can't beat the hip atmosphere, although the crowd is usually a little older than myself.  But who cares!??!!  If I had $100 left to my name, I'd spend it here.  Seriously.
4	"""Can you say celebrity hot-spot?

Last time I was here I saw Dan Majerle-and I heard a European soccer team was here...single ladies?!  \n\nThe restaurant is dimly lit and modern but elegant and romantic.  Since this is Scottsdale, you could wear jeans and some high heels or shorts and sandals. I've seen men in here with Hawaiian shirts or golf shirts and shorts. Later in the evening I've seen the high heels and tight mini skirts and men with some dinner jackets so it depends on the time of day.\n\nI've been here a few times and if you come for an early dinner you'll see family's.  In the evening, the bar has some standing room around it and on the weekends it can be standing room only.  I've been here a few times and it's hit or miss depending on what's going on in town (convention, golf tournament, etc.)\n\nDinner is on mark, since my review is a bit overdue, I can't elaborate but I remember thinking it was fabulous! It is a \""""Italian\"""" restaurant but not the typical menu-more Mediterranean.  A huge outdoor patio is wonderful too.  I saw a few smokers out there so during dinner you could walk out for a smokey.  \n\nDrinks were a hit too, I had champagne-so you could plan for a Kir Royal and nice appetizer at the bar or stay for dinner.

3	"""I took a few staycation days this week and made a list of things I never have time to do.  Getting food @ Rito's was on the list.  I've lived in Garfield for 2 years, but I work outside of the neighborhood from 9-5, so I'm never around during Rito's business hours (according to a sign inside, M-F, 9-4).  I rode my bike over on a fine, sunny Friday around 12:30.  I approached from the south, so I could see the patio seating.  If you approach from Roosevelt St., it's easy to miss this place!  There's no signage of any kind, but lots of people parking and waiting outside.\n\nThe atmosphere is absolute hole in the wall.  You order through a window with bars at the counter, which is a practical arrangement for the location.  Garfield is pretty chill these days, but that has not always been the case.  There are chairs along the wall for your waiting pleasure, but not nearly enough and they get snagged quickly.  There's a limited menu, but the day I visited, there were 4 specials written on a chalk board.\n\nI am an enchilada girl, so I was pretty happy when I saw them on the specials board.  I know burritos are what Rito's is known for, but I figured I could come back any day and try a burrito.  I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas and a side of beans.  I waited about 15 minutes for my food.  I put it in my bike basket and pedaled home in anticipation of a great Mexican lunch.\n\nThe enchiladas were generous, but the sauce was not nearly as tasty as the sauce at Carolina's.  And the enchiladas were pretty greasy.  The beans were soupy and delicious.  I will not order the enchiladas again, but I will go back and give the burritos a try.  The sodas are in cans, so I passed on a beverage.\n\nI'm glad I didn't wait until next week to make my Rito's excursion, because a sign inside announced that they'll be closed all week for \spring break.\"""""""""""
5	This may be one of the most romantic restaurants in Phoenix, but there was nothing romantic about the way I devoured my food today at Coup Des Tartes, and I mean that in the nicest way possible. \n\nI found Coup Des Tartes on a whim and decided it was the perfect spot for a girls lunch with some coworkers to just chill without the guys upon my return home. I was right on the money. The place is cozy and inviting and I love the house setting that just makes you want to let you guard down. Right near our table was a photo of a flower girl and ring bearer at a wedding, just like one you'd have hanging in the hallway at your house. Everything was beautiful, right down to the French limonade bottle used for our water at the table. \n\nI can also honestly say pretty much all the food is good, well at least the appetizers and desserts... we shared a lot of items and never made it to a main course. Here are the items we had (prepare for a long list):\n\nSoup of the Day (Roasted Red Pepper)\nBrie Brulee\nChevre / Tomate\nThree Onion Tarte\nLatte with a shot of hazelnut\nBanana Brulee\nChocolate Peanut Butter Tarte\n\nI have to say that everything was truly decadent and I wanted to eat 50 more of them. The red pepper soup was the perfect starter and had just the right amount of flavor. The three onion tarte we split and downed within probably a minute or so!! This also came with a side of lettuce with a shallot vinaigrette for an added bonus (yum). I don't like tomatoes so I have to admit I didn't really have the main part of the chevre/tomate but the cheese and bread it was on was absolutely delicious. And the brie? Yum.... oh the beautiful brie. The carmelized apples on top..mmmmmmmmm an the fruits and bread with it really topped it all off perfectly.\n\nJust when we thought we were all done, we were told about banana brulee and chocolate peanut butter tart. How delicious were both of them. On what we thought were full stomachs, we devoured them whole while I also enjoyed a latte with a shot of hazelnut. It came with a cube of raw sugar and was placed in the most simple yet adorable coffee cup and saucer. \n\nIn the end, the price was well worth it and the staff was amazing and kind. They gave us just the right amount of space and truly let us enjoy ourselves. The pounds my scale added to my weight afterward was well worth it. It just means salad and a run tonight :)\n\nThank you Coup Des Tartes. I'll definitely be back. I haven't had a chance to try lunch or dinner yet :)

4	This is another spot that is great for bringing the furry friends. I like seeing other people out who include their dogs in the fun. Who wants to leave them home when they are so cute? I love the orange tables, the small inside space is cute but I haven't ever dined inside because Clover always comes with. \n\nI think I was rubbed the wrong way the first time I came here because the waitress was stand-offish, but now I realize that is kind of the approach at this place. Not a bad thing though. I'm usually not out to make a BFF while I'm eating. Anyway, like others have said, it's best to show up for brunch on a lazy saturday when you're not in a big rush. I've had the apple pancakes and they were SO good. Honey butter and warm maple syrup. Wow they were fantastic. \n\nI brought my vegetarian pals and they loved the food, they were both able to find something they liked. So basically there is something for everyone here. Not to mention the best beer list around. It is annoying, though, that they are often out of the beers on the list so you have to keep picking.\n\nAll in all, a great spot to hang out and enjoy your company. I love the park adjacent to the patio, a great spot to walk around after eating.
4	I stumbled across this place during my break at ASU. I decided to forego my typical on-campus lunch and explored the city. I was very glad I found this place! I ordered the Chicken Feta Salad lunch special with a drink & fresh pita for $8. Was a little pricey for a college student, but the guy at the counter informed me they give 10% discount for students... something I'll know for next time! Anyways, the salad was very yummy and full of fresh ingredients. I wasn't sure what dressing to get, so the cashier suggested the house dressing and said if I didn't like it, I could switch. I went with it and was very satisfied! The staff was very friendly and I had a positive experience! Will definitely come back sometime!
4	I love the name, design, and atmosphere of lux. Ive been here a couple times, and the coffees pretty good, but I go for the light table.\n\nIt's a great place to sketch some logos on and set up the laptop, which I was one of the 80% percent of people who had one. I'm guessing people in lux without a laptop are secretly jealous they had some cool job where they got paid to drink coffee and chill. \n\nIve also had this orange-kind of a drink which  was not such a great choice in a hipster java shop so i wont reccommend that but its definetly a rad place to check out.
5	I have been to True Food 3 times now and i am very impressed. first of all the decor is bright, airy, and environmentally responsible with reclaimed wood floors and those awesome dyson hand dryers in the bathrooms. filtered water is brought to the table in reusable glass bottles. \nwhy people have written that they dont like to watch the food being prepped on the open table confuses me. some of the best kitchens in the world have an open kitchen and watching chefs prep beautiful fruits and vegetables shows me how much they care about the quality of their produce.\nNow to the food- the only time i have ever heard of olivelo juice and it was delicious. so was the green ice tea and the cucumber refresher.\ni have had over half the menu and even the tempeh tlt which i thought  might be too healthy turned out to be Delicious. the soba noodles , shrimp dumplings and local vegetables were really fresh and tasty.\nloved the kale salad and the green tea soba noodles. turkey burger was very nice and i didnt miss not having beef. Overall i like the eclectic mix on the menu and i can always find something i am in the mood for. I highly recommend giving this place a try. I will be eating here every week.
5	The topic of Mrs Whites would frequently come up in the office place by a coworker who used to work near there, at the New Times. This past week though it came up quite often, often enough that on Monday, when we were planning our lunch out together for Thursday, we were so hungry by talking about Mrs Whites that it only took until shortly after 11 for us to pile in her car and head out for some good ol' soul food. \n\nI can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this place is. It's like walking into Grandma's kitchen and getting all those great meals you used to love and enjoy. My mouth was watering and my stomach was singing before I even had a chance to sit down. \n\nI like that all the meals are the same price. It makes it so much easier. I also like the selection of sides and dishes. The red kool-aid was delicious but not in a mason jar like Lolos.\n\nThe staff was very friendly. One of my coworkers was craving ox tail and it started a big discussion between us and our waitress. She mentioned that Mr. Larry might know when it was available again (they were apparently out of it that day) and he even came out to the table to talk to us. My friend also then got his ox tail. I tried it. It's really damn good. I'd probably order it if it was available the next time I came around.\n\nI went for the 3 piece smothered chicken (fried chicken and gravy) and red beans and rice. Wow that is a lot of food. I devoured the chicken fairly quickly. It was delicious. Best friend chicken I've had aside from my Grandma's. The red beans and rice I had to package up and bring home. I had them for dinner tonight and they were just as delicious as I imagined. \n\nI also tasted one bite of the peach cobbler a la mode. Peaches are not one of my favorite fruits but damn did they do it right. \n\nIf you haven't been here, it's a definite must. I'm not sure why you're still reading this. Pack up and go. Move it.
4	I never have a bad meal at Pita Jungle. While I go to the one at Desert Ridge and the original in Tempe, the Arrowhead location is the one I most frequent. The servers are always very nice and attentive. I usually get the Macro plate or the spicy chicken pita. A side of garlic potatoes is my usual side. The hummus is great, though, I think True Food does their hummus better. The decaf berry tea is yummy and hits the spot. But the thing I really love and just discovered is the kid's menu. If you want your kid to eat healthy, this is the meal to get and they will eat it. I select one protien (chicken, legumes, garden burger, etc) a Green (carrots, broccoli, spinach, ect) and a Carb (12 grain bread, mac/cheese, pita.) Its $4.99 and served on a tray with four compartments (the fourth holds a little fruit medley.) I can go there and have a healthy, delicious meal and also feed my one-year old something other than grilled cheese or hot dog. \nSomeday, I need to try the Caribbean Salad. It looks delish. I love fruit and coconut. I will keep going back and so glad they have locations around the Valley.
5	I never thought I would say this, but I recently had a breakfast better than one consumed at Matt's.  It's best not to go any further.  That being said, whenever I am off on a weekday, the urge to go to Matt's emerges at the crack of dawn and does not subsist until I have either satiated myself with hash browns at their tiny digs or have painfully decided to deny myself the rich excess.\n\nThe wait is almost always 45 minutes even if you are a party of 1.  Going later helps reduce the wait.  Sometimes.  The wait though only builds the appetite and anticipation.  This is food that deserves such dedication.\n\nI almost exclusively get the special.  And they are all special.  However, the most special of all specials was my first and one that I hope will make a comeback soon.  Imagine for yourself: Chicken Artichoke Sausage, Fresh Mozzarella, Organic Spinach (locally grown, mind you), Hash Browns, and Whole Wheat Toast (with some local fruit preserves that they like to give a lot of props to when they deliver it to you).\n\nAlso, cheers to the wait staff who work frantically in such a small space.  I also appreciate their sort of Mother Hubbard, pseduo-indie, partially jeans and a t-shirt dress code.
1	This is a tough review to write. On the one hand their cook is incredible! He's nice, remembers your order, and makes one of the best Breakfast Burritos in town! I would highly recommend getting the Bacon one and adding jalepenos. \n\nAlso, if you go there for lunch and get one of their specials, it is very generica cafeteria food. Of the items served on their specials, typically one is pretty good, one is really bad (to the point you can't eat it), and one is mediocre. \n\nWhile the food passes the test for cheap quick food, what kills this place in the ratings is the cashier's ability to be unfriendly, almost all of the time. If you go there just once or twice, you wouldn't even notice it. But, if you go there most days of the week for breakfast, it starts to ruin the great breakfast burrito.\n\nI'll still eat here, but if anyone recommends anywhere else, count me in!
4	"""I do love Dunkin Donuts..... specifically the Toasted Coconut and Chocolate Frosted cake. :)\n\nPretty much 99% of the time I get the Coffee & 2 donuts combo (of course the Toasted Coconut & Chocolate Frosted cake). \n\nI used to go here WAY too often -- so often, that they know it's me when I order at the drive-thru. Cause I get the \Toasted Coconut & Chocolate Frosted cake\""""..... \n\nAnd seriously, I have to say that everytime -- cause for a long time they would mess up and give me a chocolate glazed donut or chocolate frosted glazed donut - - def not the same. \n\nFriendly staff. Make sure you get the coffee punch card if you order alot of Medium-sized coffees here..."""""""
4	I've eaten at the Breakfast Joynt three times so far, take out once and dine in twice.\n\nThe restaurant itself reminded me of a diner, tables in the middle and booth seats with tables around the edge.  Outdoor seating for when it's not outrageously hot outside.  You seat yourself which I don't love but I'm a fool for delicious food so I can live with self-seating.\n\nTake out dishes:  California benedict (husband), multigrain waffle for me, we both had bacon and hash browns.  He LOVED the benedict.  The eggs traveled surprisingly well, still runny enough for him when he got back to the house.  My waffle wasn't super hot but this is always my experience with take out waffles.  A quick trip to the toaster oven and I was back in business.  I must say, I was concerned because multigrain seems to = sickly sweet in many places...not so here, it was delicious!  Bacon was awesome (I always order bacon extra well done), what a flavor!  Hash browns were delicious as well.\n\nDine in dishes: California benedict (husband) on both trips despite the fact he swore he was going to try the benedict with sausage on the second trip.  I had the pancakes and then the BLT.  Benedict was loved both times.  I thought the pancakes were excellent.  The BLT was off the hook.  Big thick slices of whole wheat, loaded with their delicious bacon (extra well done) and crinkle cut fries.  Each time they brought a big carafe of coffee and we also enjoyed a freshly squeezed glass of grapefruit juice.\n\nI like the fact that they have several side options with the BLT though they had me at crinkle cut fries.  \n\nThey do not take American Express which is weird but not the end of the world.  Our server was friendly, almost too friendly but that's just me.
4	Tried Cherubini today after a coworker who has a sweet tooth like me told me about it. \nThe samples of doughnuts were enough to convince hubby & I to buy a few to take home. \nWe ordered a panini for lunch and it was good, hubby said his was great (Arizona Turkey Panini). Had a coffee too, was good. \nOverall, this place offered a little of everything that satisfied all our cravings well. I did think it was slightly over-priced but not enough for me to NOT go back. There are a couple more panini's & salads on the menu I want to try.
4	I recently went here with my friends for a late night dinner on a Saturday night. I like the ambiance of the place. There was a live band and they were all right, but I found them to be a bit loud and made it difficult to talk to the people at the same table. The drinks here were really awesome. I really enjoyed the clown punch. The dirty school girl was also really good. The wait staff was really attentive and would check up on us every so often that we rarely found ourselves without want, but not so attentive that we found ourselves annoyed. The food was all right. I ordered the fish and chips here. And it was just all right in my opinion. I prefer a thinner filet of fish so I get the crispness rather than the softness when getting into the meat of the filet. The real highlight, for me, was the dessert. They have an awesome apple monkey bread that is made to order and served with vanilla ice cream. Now I'm not one to like to eat fruit, especially apple, in my desserts, but this was just so good. I'll go back again just to top off dinner with the monkey bread :)
1	"""My mom was going to be coming back from the airport at a time I was unavailable to pick her up. We decided what made the most economical sense was to drop her car off at an airport parking lot for her to pick up the next day instead of spending a lot of money for a week of parking or a super shuttle to her house. So I found a coupon for this parking lot where we have parked many times in the past for $6.50/day with a free shuttle from the airport. \n\nWhen she picked up the car the next day she gave the ticket to the attendant which is supposed to tell them what to charge based on how long you have been there. The car was there for less than 24 hours. When the attendant first rang up the ticket there must have been a prior ticket still in the system because she told my mom her total was $23.50. What?!? My mom told her it had been there less than 24 hours and that she gave her a coupon for $6.50. So the attendant corrected it and told my mom that her total is $9.50. When my mom asked about the difference between $6.50 and her total she was told that it was a $3.00 fuel and service charge. \n\nThis \fuel and service charge\"""" is ridiculous. The coupon says $6.50 per day. Said nothing about additional fees may apply. Also advertised \""""free shuttle\"""". So clearly the shuttle is not \""""free\"""" if this fuel and service charge applies. When I dropped the car off I was not told about any additional fees either. \n\n$3.00 is not a huge amount but I went here specifically because of the coupon. If I had known other fees would be added on top of the price I would have found her cheaper pricing elsewhere. I will not be returning here for my airport parking needs in the future if they tack on unannounced \""""fees\"""" at the end. The attendant was very rude to my mom when she questioned the fee and the attitude was pretty much...if you want your car back pay it..."""""""
4	"""Tasty sandwich.  I got the 9\ Capastrami.  Pretty different flavors & textures than what I'm used to and it was soooo good!  The last thing we need is yet another version of Subway/Jersey Mike's/Jimmy John's etc etc.  The fresh baked and pulled meat is super delicious.  I had exceptional service.  Joe walked me through all the varieties of sandwiches and told me all about her favorites.  The two guys in the food prep area also both greeted me & wished me a good evening when I left.  Friendly, fast, overall great!"""""""
2	DDS holds a special place in my heart.  It is the first place I remember getting kicked out of voluntarily.  By that, I mean that I left willingly, but when I had to get back in to use the atm they refused to permit me.\n\nWhy?  I don't know, because it's a miracle that I even remember that.  Who knows what else happened that night, but it can't be good, and now I strenuously refuse to go there ever again.\n\nWhat's that, you ask?  The service?  The food/drink quality?  I don't know about any of this because I was too busy looking through a darkened kaleidoscope of debauchery that included women dancing on the bar and having their bras cut off by the bartenders.  If I had to guess, I would say I probably was just standing there in a stupor with a 15 degree leftward lean going on, the kind of lean that my friends know can only mean one thing: I need to stop drinking.
2	Took our son here for his birthday last night as he loves sushi. We had a $25 gift certificate and so ordered lots anticipating this. When we pay the bill and present the gift certificate to the waiter he advises us that they refuse to take it as they are in some legal battle with the company that issued it, restaurant.com. Not my problem! Had a valid certificate and planned on using it. We were advised by restaurant.com that it was good indefinitely. Apparently not so! Quite disappointed the restaurant did not want to do right by new customers. So many other places to spend our money.....
1	Okay beside the fact that this is not real mexican food it was just sad to even call it food, on my first visit i made it my last the food is disgusting but i managed to eat something. . Then on my way out was the worst part i went to wash my hands and the bathroom was the worst thig i had ever seen there was vomit and shit everywhere seriously a health and safty violation please don't bother bringing ur family or friends here unless u want diarrhea!
4	"""\Lookin' for nothing.... But a good time..... \"""" Who doesn't love Metal Head? So much fun on Sunday nights! \n\nIn case you live under a rock, Metal Head is an 80's hear metal cover band that plays all over the valley, and Martini Ranch is there regular Sunday night stopping grounds. Everything from Guns'n'Roses to Matalica to Bon Jovi to Def Leppard...... it's hair-mazing! \n\nMartini Ranch itself is pretty good. They have several bars, one in the main part, one outside, and one large bar up in the Shaker Room, the dance room. The concept is pretty cool, live bands, patio and a dance floor all in one?! Saweet! \n\nWe don't make it is very often, but when we do it is usually a great time. Watch out though... another buyer beware warning.... If you open a tab they will put a $50 hold on your card, just found that out this morning. Awesome! Not!"""""""
1	The salon has moved from its original location, now it's in a strip mall down a long dark corridor in a tiny, cramped room and there is barely room for the stylist, a parent, and a child.  The stylist arrived late, was rather shockingly unkempt, and sat down upon arrival and talked at us for thirty minutes before starting to cut my daughter's hair.  Not sure why I waited, but I didn't want to be rude.  Forty five minutes later, we had a haircut that did not resemble in the least the cut I'd requested and I was just happy to get out of there.  Wouldn't dream of going back and would never recommmend it to anyone.
1	when i worked in retail my paycheck was spent before i got paid. therefore, i relied heavily on coupons and splitting meals w all of my other poor college friends.\n\nwell, i hit the jackpot. $15 coupon for a FEAST. the picture on the coupon showed everything we would get: a huge steak, shrimp, and lobster PLUS 2 sides. there were 3 of us- this was PLENTY. \n\nit was prom night too so we were initally fooled with how popular it was. popular for prom girls with light up clear shoes (not even lying), if that says anything about the crowd for you...\n\nour waitress stops by our booth and just stares at us. one of my friend kinda looks around at me and our other friend, then back at the waitress. 'ill have a diet coke?'\n\nthen our waitress writes it down and doesn't say anything but looks at my other friend.\n\ni lost it and started laughing. why isn't she talking to us? this is so weird. \n\nwe ended up asking for a different waitress, then found out the coupon was a big fat liar. you didn't get all of that. it just says you do but you don't. the food ended up being nasty. probably one of the worst meals ive ever had. \n\nas we're leaving susy talks a lot waitress trips over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldn't control laughing. \n\nawful food, awful service, AND the bathrooms were some of the grossest i had ever been in. \n\nif wal-mart ran a restaurant, this would be it.
5	What an neat place built on a great idea! The breakfast is fresh, local, and pretty reasonably priced. The big draw is the location, though; sitting outdoors in the great weather and taking in the farm and mountain scenery is very, very nice. Even if it rains, the place is covered by umbrellas that keep you dry. \n\nIf you're in Phoenix with a car, it's only a short and worthwhile drive from downtown. It's a little difficult to spot, so you might drive by pretty easily if you're not fully attentive.
4	Went with wife and her parents for dinner last night to Herb Box.  The temp is finally coming down in AZ so sitting outside on the cute patio was an amazing treat.  The food could have been mediocre and we would have had a nice night; however, the food was far from mediocre.  Very delicious.\n\nStarted out with the beef carpaccio which was really good but just a little bit too salty.  I could not tell if the salt was added on or just due to the meat but tasted like extra salt was added for seasoning.  For dinner we had the trout (cooked perfectly) with this yummy mac and cheese as a side.  We also had the balsamic beet side.  I am a huge fan of beets and they did a great job with this side.\n\nDefinitely recommend giving The Herb Box a try if you are in the North Scottsdale area.
2	I've had Grimaldi's saved in my bookmarks for awhile, and this Saturday I found an excuse to go. Family dinner night! I was in charge of figuring out where to eat and since we were all craving pizza and my mom was paying, I chose this place. By the end of the night, most of my family was a little ticked off at me for my choice. \n\nI was super excited to try this place based on the reviews, and I am really sad that it did not live up to my expectations. I was literally expecting some of the best pizza I have ever had in my life. We come in around 7pm and its busy but we still manage to get a table right away. None of us order drinks because I think we all looked at the price of the pizza and figured this was going to be pretty expensive. We decided on two small pizzas: one half pepperoni (for my sister) and half mushroom, the other with the sweet roasted red peppers. \n\nThe service was a little strange. Our waiter didn't make eye contact all night. He looked at other tables, at his paper, or down at the floor when he talked to us. Was there something on our faces? I don't know, but it was really odd. The guy that delivered the pizzas to our table was nice though, and he served us all our first slice. I thought that was a nice touch. He was also very willing to get us new plates right away when the ones at our table were dirty. \n\nThe pizzas did not take long to come out, but I was a little surprised by them when they did. I literally couldn't tell the pepperoni or the red peppers from the sauce. The pepperonis were the tiniest I have ever seen. I didn't get any feedback from my sister or my husband on whether or not these were any good, so I am assuming they were either ok, or kind of boring. The mushrooms were flavorless and really thin. I think on my slice of pizza there were four mushrooms. Sad day, I love mushrooms. I am a little bit bothered by the fact that they still charge you $2 per topping even if you only get it on half of the pizza. Considering as well the toppings were tiny and hard to see. The red peppers were even more of a let down. $4 for that option as a topping. They were flavorless as well. And again, really sparse. The pizzas in general were really lacking in the flavor department. I tasted no specific spices, let alone no salt. The cheese was really bland as well. How can you have bland mozzarella? It seemed impossible to me. \n\nSo by the end of the meal my whole family was annoyed with me because we could have gone to any other pizza place and gotten 3 times as much pizza for half the price. Two small pizzas with essentially two (marginal) toppings cost $40. No drinks, no wine, no salad, no desert. My mom didn't say it, but she wasn't happy either, since she paid. Sorry mom, but don't worry I wont make that mistake again.
4	This is about the 7th place around the country that I've had Chicken & Waffles. Very authentic, the atmosphere is what it should be.\nService- outstanding, very helpful and friendly- 4stars\nDrinks- big cool bottles- 4 stars\nCollard Greens - spicy, tasty, make your momma proud and eat some- 5 stars\nMac N cheese - not that great, I mean it's better than the out of the box stuff, but after reading the reviews I expected more of the gourmet style. - 3 stars\nRed Velvet cake- a bit dry and bland- 3 stars\n\nWill I return next time I'm in the area- sure thing
4	AY. DIOS. MIO.\n\nThe Platano Paleta is a day-maker. There's caramel, creamy, frozen chunks of banana, and a\u00f1ejo rum all swirled together on one wooden stick. At least five different people asked me what I was eating and where they could get it as I walked down Mill Avenue, vainly trying not to make eye contact with anyone while eating a popsicle. If you're looking for something new and interesting (and sexy, as popsicles go), eating one of these would be more effective in drowning one's sorrows than a pint of ice cream.\n\nFor the more timid, or perhaps just fans of classic flavors, the Fresa con Crema actually smells and tastes of a fresh, organic strawberry upon first bite, until the flavor of rich cream overwhelms the taste buds to create a perfect harmony of awesome and more awesome. Anyone who's partial to artificial strawberry flavor over that of a real strawberry should a) avoid this paleta and b) reprogram your mouth and possibly reevaluate your life. \n\nPure fruit lovers, even you cannot escape the appeal of Paletas Betty. The Pura Pi\u00f1a is almost just a frozen pineapple on a stick, but much more exciting. It's a sweet, delectable confection filled with pineapple pieces and a consistency that's closer to creamy than it is to icy, even though this one's totally vegan. It also contains some sort of hallucinogen that will make you think you're in Jamaica for a short period of time.\n\nGo. Eat. Prosper. You'll probably see me there with a paleta in each hand.
5	I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cute, boutique!  We were killing time a few weeks ago and just happened to wander into Charming Charlies aka a jewelry fanatics heaven.\n\nFirst, it's visually pleasing.  Each section is color coded which is FANTASTIC.  I headed straight for the purple section.  For costume jewelry, you really can't beat the prices, and the customer service was wonderful as well.\n\nMy best find, though--three pairs of heels for $15 total.  And I'm not talking cheap, Payless heels.  These are beauties and I got compliments galore when I wore them on a recent trip to Vegas.\n\nI'll be back soon to be charmed, Charlie. :)
4	"""I feel like a tool reviewing another grocery store. I was MADE to feel like a tool for choosing to grocery shop wearing yoga pants and flip flops instead of $800.00 Louboutins. \nRealllly.... how do rich ladies #1,2 and 3 not have someone doing the shopping for them at this point? It was interesting if not a bit disturbing to see the new and improved options in facial rejuvenation. (I'm taking notes for the future; thanks ladies)\n\nThe nut bar won my heart. When you've had fresh ground peanut or almond butter you will never purchase regular (what I will refer to from this point forward as \over the counter PB\"""") again. I've never had anything like it. \n\nThe wine selection is perfect. I don't feel overwhelmed like I do when  shopping at Total Wine yet it's not your typical run of the mill Safeway selection. It is actually quite difficult to describe, I suggest you go see for yourself."""""""
4	I had always thought this was a Chandler restaurant, not a California chain, but the instant I walked in the door and saw how institutionalized it looked, I knew it had to be a chain.  But a damn cool one at that.  \n\nHow many places have a Baguette factory pumping out fresh baguettes every 30 minutes?  Yeah, they aren't MJ Bread quality, but hoo ya momma, they are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and yum good!\n\nI ordered a lemondade (hand made, caused a delay, three orders behind me got their sammiches first), but it was fresh and tasty, though smallish (12oz with ice?).\n\nAnd the funny part was the only Vietnamese in the place (18-19 year old girl) running the cash register warned me that my shredded pork (#8) had fish sauce on it and it was 'an acquired taste!'  I loved it.  The first time I had fish sauce I was in love.  \n\nThe only other sandwich shop that hit me in the yummer like this one was Birley's on Market Street in SFO.  \n\nI wish it was closer to home!
3	I can say that I used to love the place. Not so much any longer. \n\nWent over there this past Sunday at 7pm. Crowded, but still room to sit 6 of us. Here are a few simple notes to sum up the evening.\n\nWaitress was on something. She was walking, but out of it. Forgot our order twice, and both times could not remember even taking them. Very bizarre. \nGirl next table fell over and out of her chair. No one really even seemed to notice, maybe that happens often here now. \nPlace looks tired, worn out, especially the fabric on the chairs and booths outside. If you squint, you can see the old Vig, when it seemed spotless, and shiny. Now a bit tattered, along with the staff. \n\nIf you are over 28, then I would have to say you might feel old in here. Reminds me of a spring break crowd being filmed by an MTV crew in Cabo. Very young, very drunk.
5	4.5 stars.  There's something weirdly charming about Homme.  Not sure if it's the cheap drinks, the crowd, the converted two-story house layout, the Central Phoenix club circuit regulars, or the fact that it's constantly evolving -- adding DJs/nights seemingly all the time.  \n\nI went here the other night for Friday's relocated French Kiss newwave/indie/punk/electro dance party and have to say it was a blast.  I had been here a few times before - once on a Thursday night with Bonnie, once for Tuesday night karaoke, and even when it was a creepy old fogey gay bar a few years ago.\n\nThe space is just right for the dance party, and the upstairs DJ/dancefloor area lends itself well to those who are seeking an added bonus - in this case, deep house.  The decor here is OK, nothing special, really - although it is more brightly lit, and brightly painted than it used to be.  Lots of nooks and crannies here and an intimidating narrow spiral staircase, which is good if you get bored with conventional spaces.\n\nThe crowd is diverse (gay, straight, black, white, brown, whatevs) and depending on the night it's crawling with hipsters, club kids and electro/new wave/indie/tribal/house/breakbeat aficionados.  These are the types of people who go somewhere for the music and could give an eff about anything else.  With the clientele and music selection, Homme has the feel of a more cosmopolitan LA/SF dance club, but without the attitude.\n\nHomme will be seeing more of Stevey, no doubt.
3	Let me start by saying this place isn't BAD.....it's just not awesome. I went here on Friday night with the BF for a date and to use a Doozy Deal coup. We made reservations on opentable, which got us the table, but oddly, instead of confirming that we went to the restaurant, they cancelled our reservation. This was kind of annoying because we didn't get our points, but it could have been an honest mistake. We tried a variety of food including: arancini, drunken cheesy bread, strands w meatballs, and minestrone soup. We also got drinks- I got the Italian margarita and the BF got some white wine. His wine came out with cork or dust in it at first, but they replaced it when he told them. The marg was good, like an alcoholic slushee. The food was all pretty good...the minestrone had lots of veggies, but was on the salty side. The bread was a bit odd...did taste like wine, but I probably wouldn't order it again. The arancini were really good! They had some pancetta in it and came with a really tasty lemony sauce and a marinara. I only wish there were more of them! The 'strands' were good and the meatballs were juicy. The service was friendly but slow. Also, they brought all of our food out at the same time, which I didn't love because it made everything get cold before we got a chance to eat it...don't know why they wouldn't bring soup, then apps, then mains.....Overall, it was good...it just wasn't great....and I thought it was a bit overpriced. I would consider going back and giving them another try, especially for a happy hour or something.
2	IKEA can suck my LEKSVIK.\n\nEvery time I go to IKEA, I'm reminded why I hate it so much - and yet I keep returning. Just entering the store is like going on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride - once you enter, you can't leave until you've taken the entire tour through the maze of shitty Swedish furniture. They provide you with cheap shitty food, a place to crap or puke it out, and strategically placed seating so you can rest. They black out the windows so you have no sense of time as well. It's evil genius. \n\nI think it's absurd that people actually eat here - like they just accept that they are being held prisoner by an evil Swedish furniture factory. The cheap food is too cheap - it's gut-rot inducing and it pains me just to think about it. Hot Dogs and Meat Balls? Are you serious? You don't even know what kind of mystery meat it is - much less if it's even real meat... and you happily pay a buck like you're really sticking it to the man with your bargain meal. Gag me.\n\nJust like at Disneyland, people bring their fucking ugly kids here and allow them to run around free screaming like wild animals. Parents use their strollers as battering rams to make way through the crowd. Nobody in there has ever showered in their life. I sometimes suspect that everyone there is a paid extra - nobody is ever buying anything.\n\nThere are two ways to shop here: 1. Arrive having researched and read the catalog and have a specific list of things to buy. 2. Wander around aimlessly for 3 hours, pick up something that you kinda need and carry it around with you for another 3 hours, give up the moment you have the exit door in sight and leave your single pathetic item on a pallet of flat-pack deck chairs and bypass the checkout lines so you can taste freedom at last.\n\nIKEA furniture is cheap, but expensive. It looks nice from far away, but up close you can see that it's junk. Run your hand along any of their wood counter surfaces and you'll feel the warping. Have a look at any corner on any dresser and you'll see the finish peeling away. It's good for utility furniture or to fill out a guest bedroom or storage room or kids room, but unless you're a college kid - this furniture is garbage. To top it off, it's overpriced. \n\nThe only things worth buying here are lightbulbs and batteries (which honestly aren't that great) because they are cheap. Even their flatware is crap - it rusts... yes, it rusts. You're better off going to Tuesday Morning or Ross or even Target and picking up something nicer. Don't be fooled by the contemporary modern urban stylings - IKEA is overpriced crappy junk. It's not cheap because they flat pack and pass the savings on to you - it's cheap because it's junk. \n\nI have some IKEA dressers and I use them as DVD storage - they work fine, but I don't expect them to last forever. Their couches are all uncomfortable, their chairs are even worse. The beds are barely one step up from sleeping on the floor. Their kitchen and bathroom cabinets are awful - you'll be sorry if you remodel your rooms with this stuff. \n\nI like the look of IKEA - honestly, I do. I think it's a good concept and they have some really good style ideas. Nothing they sell is really well-made and assembly is required... considering what it is, it's overpriced. That said - you can find some decent stuff here. Inexpensive poorly-crafted furniture has its applications.
5	When you get a seat and settle in this place is the best.  If you have to stand for awhile (and you very well may have too) that part is gonna suck no doubt about it.\n\nWent here on a Saturday night and out of the 2 hours we were here the music was 95% Radiohead and Thom Yorke solo stuff, that's what 5 star drinking establishments are made of!\n\nExtensive wine list with a few by-the-glass selections written on the chalkboards each night.   Ton's of micro beers to choose from.   We didn't get a chance to eat here but the food looked like the perfect match for this place, simple, fun, and creative.     I'll be back for sure with my fingers crossed that they always play 95% Radiohead and I wasn't there on a special night.
4	Pretty cool idea!  Basically they have about ten different frozen yogurts.  You pick a cup size you pick your yogurt.  You can mix match add as much toppings as you want or as little they weight it and you pay per ounce around .32 cents an ounce.  So awesome!  I like the cheesecake with Oreo cookie yogurt.  They have fruit and candy toppings.  This place is basically a make it yourself frozen yogurt shop.  Fun for kids and adults!   We are a big fan.  If you want regular ice cream they sell that too its thrifty ice cream.  They also have shaved ice and smoothy's.  This is a mom and pop owned frozen treat shop.  Its in a little corner of the shopping center so its easy to miss but so worth it.
2	all i can say is they cut g's bagel. i was explicitly clear in my order: one plain bagel as it is. no cutting, no toasting, just a normal bagel please, with plain cream cheese on the side. \n\nthey cut g's bagel anyway. and just because saturday was my lucky day, the plain bagel they cut and smothered with an excessive amount of cream cheese was the last one.\n\nmy bagel was ordered toasted, but received un-toasted. i can't say i really cared. but when i order the bagel in its natural state, i really want to receive it that way. please. and seriously,  who runs out of plain bagels at 9 am on saturday?!
4	Dearest Abbey, you lose a star because the price for the Ceremony of Loveliness is too high.  Granted you have included tip and tax in the individual price so I don't have to bother w/ the icky math, but $23 seems high for sandwiches, a few savories, scones and some desserts.  Didn't you also use to include fruit?\n\nHowever, you still rock a great tea, the food is good and it is so girly fun to browse and linger...I will keep coming when I want to let my inner maiden out.
1	"""I have to say i'm quite saddened that i had to choose 1 star; as i was so looking forward to finding a new fav along Camelback rd. my sister and i headed to Rosie Mc Caffreys (sp), but turned off at SunUp Brewing Co. by default; we had to stop in because we were both starved and the menu offered Corned Beef and cabbage, plus we still had about 6 streets to go. \n\nwe stepped inside to a \please wait to be seated\"""" sign, so we waited, and waited (as several wait staff passed and looked our way without even a nod of acknowledgement) for about 5 minutes. finally our server approached us and offered inside or patio (we chose patio of course!) she was very nice at first seating and asked for our drink order. since neither of us partake in the appreciation for micro brews, we chose raspberry ciders. we were happy. the crowd was sparse-but present. the weather was fabulous. \n\nit was a weird set-up with 3 small rooms (patio in between both) and no room to turn around. there was no reason our server should have been perturbed; other than having to maneuver around tables inside, as she hardly had tables. none the less, when she returned with our beers, she plopped them down hard on the table and stormed off. the beers were served lukewarm but we tried to drink them anyways. \n\nshe returned a few minutes later for our order. since it was a toss up between the Corned beef and cabbage & the Fish n chips, i asked the servers opinion, inquiring if the corned beef was sliced thin, of to which she replied \""""it isn't sliced thin\""""-but it was sliced thinner than a nickel, plus the meal wasn't even served with bread or butter; but back to the ordering....\n\nafter she took our order, i asked her for 2 cold pint glasses; since the beers were warm (only the bottle was slightly cold). she brought back glasses with ice and straws, pounced them on the rod iron table and went on to tell me why micro brews aren't served in cold pint glasses, saying she didn't have any chilled pint glasses because this is a micro brewery. \n\nit wasn't until after her lecture on the creation of beer, that i explained that even if there is a right way to serve-some people do request chilled pints. i explained that i wasn't a beer afficionado, i just wanted to drink my beer the way it should be served \""""chilled\"""" she gave me attitude, walked away and then returned with two cold pint glasses, pouncing them on the table as she uttered \""""here these are for our Root Beer\"""" while she turned on her heels to run. \n\nthe rest of the meal was pleasant, as she was hardly available. the only time i seen any of the female servers was when an assumingly wealthy man was spotted, that was when most of the servers would approach and hug them (much to close by restaurant standards) very tightly. however most tables around us were either taken by lesbians or hetero females so the ladies weren't hoovering around us too much.  \n\nwe received the credit card bill to sign, which was also plopped off mid walkaway. the tables are patio tables with holes, so most people with common sense would prepare for the signing of the bill with a hard bottom of some sort, but not here! they are all consumed with the spotting of rich men and instructions for micro brewing that they don't have time to serve or be of assistance, so be prepared to either pay them upfront to be treated like a patron, or flash your directors card because they seem to think this is suddenly Scottsdale. \n\non to the food. i tasted my sisters fish and chips and the homemade chips were soggy from the fish. the halibut was delicious although sister had to pull off all the breading, because it was as thick as an Indian popover. they did serve it with spicy ketchup which was surprisingly delicious. my corned beef cabbage was served paper thin, without bread or butter; but it was still very tasty. the red potatoes soft and the carrots & cabbage blanched to perfection. next time i'll just try sitting at the bar."""""""
3	Sports Authority is like the Walmart of sporting goods stores. No, wait, that would be Big 5. I guess they are more like Target. Reasonable prices, and products that don't completely fall apart the first time you use them (but they are still made in China) and no service whatsoever. And Dick's is more like a Dillard's or Macy's because they have the higher end brands and employees that are older than 16 or 17 years old. So then I guess Bass and Cabela's would be more like Nordstrom's? That's where the really nice stuff is but you usually walk out without purchasing anything unless they are having a sale. Except Cabela's is sort of specialized so I think that would be more analogous to something like an Ann Taylor.\n\nOk, I know I have gone way off topic here but I think I have made it abundantly clear that I am not a regular customer. But I do occasionally come in to buy gifts for family and friends. On my most recent visit, I came in, wandered around for about 20 minutes and then found what I needed (with no help whatsoever from staff), paid and left. A two star experience for sure but I have to give them an extra one since they offer a discount when you check in thru the Yelp app on your smart phone and so that saved me 10 bucks.
4	MY favorite Z's by far! The one on mill is decent but the bloody mary bar here on the weekends is much larger! My service is always amazing and cannot help but ask for the same server every sunday, I cannot believe I have forgotten his name but he is great! \nThe bloody nary bar is full of different tomato juices and things to put in it, and if they run out of anything they are quick to jump and get you more. The cornbread and peach muffin are my favorite, I dont even like muffins but i always ask for an extra! I also love the jalepeno bacon and always get a side of that also, SOOOO GOOD!!\nI have yet to come during any hour but breakfast but I must try because it is delic!
4	yummy yummy yummy! right in my neighborhood. so happy with the entire meal, service, ambiance and price! i had the panini and salad, sister had the same and our bill was $20 at most. the panini was called the market, i asked for cibatta, fresh mozarella, basil and tomatoes very fresh! followed by the mediteranean salad topped with a tsatziki dressing, which was plesantly surprising, as i normally hate that stuff! its always so acidic, but alas....not here!!! plus the vegtables are all so bright, fresh and crisp. my flavored ice tea was tasty too! the servings were so perfect for the price! i even had half of a panini to bring home to eat....right about now lol! the place is D-E-O-L-I-C-I-O-U-S, and so close to home yay! next time i'm trying the Mozarella & Tomatoes because its served with walnut bread and i love walnuts.\n\nthe service was pleasantly wonderful! we never had to ask for more water or tea, our food was brought out in a very timely manner and the overall atmosphere of the place was quit relaxing. the bathroom door is so sweet! i love to roll things and this big mambo jumbo door rolls!
5	Wow, this must be the saving grace of the city!  I don't think that there's anything that I like more than this with the exception of my friends that live here.  We entered the mountain on the side of Echo Canyon Road.  I believe there was some event being hosted in climbing the summit or something.  I wasn't sure what to expect because I haven't gone hiking since I was much younger and more trails that were through a forest.  Being out in the desert was quite different.  It was a lot of rocks, and the climb is much more steeper.  Of course as the day gets on the weather is even hotter.  We arrived here probably a little after 9am.  It was slightly breezy still, but we got to the steepest part, and my friend had stopped halfway through being pretty fearful from the climb.  So we went back down so that she wouldn't have to wait for us, but I felt kind of addicted to the challenge of going through the rocks and the climb for hours.  I'm not surprised now how toned mountain climbers can be.  I was slightly annoyed by the show-offs who were running down the steps.  I think it's dangerous because there's a lot of loose gravel that can cause the best hiking boots to slip.  I would highly recommend them for this climb at this entrance.  This was a great workout even though we were here for an hour or less.  I was sweating and it's just a great feeling of accomplishment when you get from place to place.  There are tons of people out here, but it's more motivation to climb it.  If you are fearful of heights I would recommend something else first since the avid climber will try to get you moving and will complain about a hold up.  Definitely bring water and some type of small back-pack.  You won't be able to really carry much in this climb.  Some people are able to use the hiking stick and ski poles?  but I think it looks like it's more of problem to use it.  It is a fantastic view at the top.
2	"""Unfortunately, I am going to have to give Foothills Smiles two stars.\n\nLet me start off by saying Dr. Jarvis is a very good dentist.  I never had any issues with the service provided at this office.\n\nThe reason I am rating this business so low is primarily based on their billing Delta Dental for erroneous charges.  They billed Delta Dental for \Tobacco Consultation\"""" and \""""Oral Hygiene Instructions\"""" on my last visit.    I have never smoked in my entire life, so I did not want that on my chart.  I was told it was billed \""""in error\"""" after having to file a grievance with Delta Dental; Still, the office has never sent in a correction to Delta Dental (even to this date).  My daughter, who goes to the sister office next door, has never received any sort of \""""Oral Hygiene Instructions,\"""" yet the insurance company has been billed for it on every visit.  When I have spoken with front office staff for both dentists, I have been told they \""""bill everyone for that\"""" and see if it sticks.  I understand insurance companies do not pay much out these days, but I do not believe that is an ethical way of doing business.  \n\nAdditionally, I feel I was being directed to have unnecessary procedures.  After having two onlays done at this office, I was told I needed a third as a replacement for an existing amalgam filling on tooth #18.  I was advised that a regular filling would not hold because the tooth cavity was too large.  I decided to get a second opinion.  I was told that I needed, at most, a two surface filling on tooth #18.  The cost difference was about $371 after insurance.  I had the two surface filling done at another dental office and I have not experienced any discomfort or issues.\n\nBecause of the discrepancies on my EOBs and the conflicting second opinion, I no longer feel comfortable DOING BUSINESS WITH this practice.  I say \""""doing business\"""" because I feel that being a patient would imply the business cared more about me than just as a vessel to stick one to the insurance company."""""""
5	My boyfriend and I have just recently discovered Keegan's and we are in love. The fact that their happy hour starts at 8 is by far the BEST thing ever. It also makes it our go to place. I'm pretty sure in the last two weeks after we 1st visited we've been back 5 or 6 times. The prices are perfect, the service is great and the food is really delicious. I wasn't putting a lot of hope in the food but everything that we've tried has been very good. My only suggestion would be that they turn down the grill and cook the food a bit longer. I had to have them remake one of my sliders and I've seen other situation were people asked for their food to be cooked more. But the food tastes so good that it isn't even an issue for me or my usually very picky boyfriend :) we just make sure to have them cook everything well. All in all, I dig this place and will continue to visit every few days or so.
4	Yes, the place seems a bit musty and cluttered and it does have weak coffee. But the service and food make up for it. Even on the busiest Sunday mornings, we never have to wait for than 5 minutes or so.  They have delicious homemade tortillas for the best breakfast burritos around. The pancakes are light and fluffy and the potatoes as very crispy and tasty. I honestly never noticed the country music, if they really do play it because everyone I take is enjoying themselves too much.
4	OMG!!! This place is amazing! It was my first time here and I just loved the food. It is a little pricey, but not too bad for what you get. My coworkers and I started off with the salmon and artichoke. I tried artichoke before, but I was not a fan so I was a little hesitant to try it again, but I am so glad I did. Their artichoke was so good and the salmon was even better. MMMMMM...goodness! Then I had the Hawaiian Rib-eye with Fries. My meal was wonderful and I practically ate it all. My boss had the Barbecue Pork Ribs and the meat was like falling off the bones. It was ultra good!
4	The Lodge has what every one is looking for in a bar in Scottsdale - good bar food, sports on the TV's, comfy booths, a pool table, unassuming interior, etc.  Walking in the front door, past the 2 huge wood carved bigfoot (and a small one), lies the interior of a quentissential backwoods lodge.  Antlers for chandeliers - check, barstools made of solid wood - check, split wood walls - check, moose on the fireplace - check, yes, you are in for a good night out at The Lodge.
5	Friendly atmosphere...great prices...great food ( rib night on wed-- $8.95 for a 1/2 rack dinner!) and the gyros are huge and authentic! ( ru kidiin' me?!? the owners are greeks from chicago!)\nplenty of tv's....nice patio for the smoker's music once a month with chuck e. baby and the all stars acoustic jam (2nd wed of the month). poker on wed, too. \ndj on the weekend.nothing fancy about this place, but not a dive like some of the other sports bars in chandler :\n(like nate's 3rd base-- that place sucks!).\nthe hob-nob is a great place for lunch , dinner, or just to hang out. be careful on bears game day! the place is packed!
5	This place is absolutely wonderful! I've only been here twice but both times I left extremely satisfied.\n\nOn my second visit I tried some alligator and had no idea what to expect, but it tasted like spicy chicken! Awesome menu! Of course a little pricey, but totally worth it.\n\nThe atmosphere was great. Fancy and almost elaborate, but in a friendly inviting way. Very relaxed!\nservice was always fantastic.\n\nI'm a sucker for cajun, so I'll definitely be back when I get some spare cash to dump on a night of fancy feasting.
5	I love this place!! It has not changes for 20 years!!! Crazy I know. \n\nThe story behind this fantastic little martini/restaurant bar is that it is owned by Karl Kopps from Milwaukee, WI and it has sister bar in Milwaukee that is called Elsa's. Both have the same vibe and menus. What's interesting is that the artwork rotates from place to place and keeps the vibe changing. \n\nI highly recommend the burger!  Yes, I said BURGER... as in Hamburger!  It's awesome. Therefore, kick back and savor a martini while chilling to good tunes and munching on a hand-packed piece of Americana! \n\nThe bottom line: if your looking for a chic little place that always has a a great vibe. Than this is your spot. \n\nPS. Be prepared to wait for a table or come early as they so get packed!!
4	"""My in-laws took my husband and I here to thank us for helping them move. I've been wanting to try this place for over a year and I wasn't disappointed. When you first arrive you're greeted with 360 views of the valley. It's an excellent spot to take some pictures--especially at sunset. \n\nWe were promptly seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant after a trip down the slide. We had a great view even though we weren't right beside the window. That was nice. I hate going to a place with great views and staring at the back of the kitchen all night. \n\nWe started with the rattlesnake and cactus fries. I'm glad I tried these unique offerings but I'm not sure I'll try them again. No trip to the Rooste would be complete without them. I had the barbecue chicken and it was delicious. My husband had a burger and his parents had pork chops and prime rib. The cowboy beans are the best I've had. Everyone left happy with a full belly and leftovers to spare. The beer is reasonably priced and served in giant mason jar \pitchers.\"""" The best part is that every meal ends with complimentary cotton candy. \n\nThis is a great place for families and they have a full bar for the adults. Don't miss this place if you're visiting Phoenix and if you live here, why haven't you visited already?\nSay \""""hi\"""" to Horney the Bull!"""""""
5	"""Had lunch here yesterday after hiking Camelback. My friend and I wanted something tongue-tickling and refreshing and grounding. So after a drive-by True Foods I remembered that I'd wanted to Chakra 4. Friend, \Oh cool, me too!\"""" So we headed on over. After considering nearly every wrap we finally decided on a full-sized blueberry wrap. It and the accompanying side salad were the perfect size for the two of us. So we ate every morsel and sipped green tea outside under an umbrella. Service was quick and friendly.\n\nAnd I popped into the herb shop to search for a desert plant that'd moved me to \""""feelings of high joy\"""" on my hike earlier! Well instead of urging me to just buy something, the knowledgeable shopkeeper advised me to pick the plant/flower that so called to me, from the desert myself. Finally we determine that it was creasote. I love herb shops and this is a sweet one."""""""
4	Make no mistake - this isn't a mexican restaurant, and the menu seemed somewhat random to me.  Anywho.  \n\nMy husband and I arrived early to head to the bar for a drink before our reservation.  I ordered a margarita, and loved the extra shaker that went along with it - nice touch!\n\nThe group arrived and we headed to the patio, which was made quite warm by the heaters.  We started with one order of the Chorizo Fundido, and were brought two big bowls of chips and salsa to go along with it.  Word on the street was that it was delicious, but as a vegetarian I withheld.  A little while later, we were served some yummy warm tortillas and butter - a nice treat!  \n\nThere aren't many vegetarian options.  I was able to ask for the tacos with extra black beans instead of the meat, and our server was extra accommodating.  It came with 3 small tortillas and a plate full of lettuce, guac, beans, tomatoes, and rice.  It was good....but a little pricey for what it was.  \n\nOverall, this was an A-Ok restaurant but our server made it a Yay!  He was friendly and helpful.  He was professional.  He offered, pleasantly, to split checks for our group of 8 and even knew who was together.  Kudos to him!
5	"""The Mrs. and I hit this place twice in a week when we were in the area for a class.  We came armed with Groupons both times - never leave a deal behind!\n\nThe carne asada is every bit as good as they say, and the guacamole is really tasty.  Their reddish refried beans are also surprisingly scrumptious, so much so that I strayed from my beloved carne burrito to try the carne quesadilla platter the second time.  It was good but not worth the sacrifice - the burrito is chock-full of spices, veggies, and textures, while the quesadilla is more straightforward.  My lovely wife highly recommends the taco platter, which she had both times.  She mixed and matched meats the first time to try the barbacoa, but by the second time she was totally sold - all carne, all the time.\n\nThe horchata and the lemonade are also refreshing, and the staff is really nice.  Unfortunately this isn't \our side\"""" of the Valley but we vowed to come by the next time we're in the area, and inform those who are lucky enough to be in the ballpark.\n\nGive it a try, I bet you'll like it."""""""
4	There is a store, bar, bait shop, gas station & restaurant here- This review is JUST for the store. \n\nConveniently located 8 miles from Cholla Campground at Lake Roosevelt, this one-stop-shop has so much stuff crammed into a little space its just fun to check it out! They have almost every item you'd need besides groceries (Head on over to the Tonto Basin Marketplace for those items), including the all important Tonto National Forest pass for camping & boats, jet skis, trailers, etc. Reasonable prices to boot! Forgot something on your trip to the Lake- batteries, canned chili, a life vest, ski rope, sunglasses, beer???? Stop in and grab some stuff! They have it!
4	I was looking for a nice place to take my girlfriend for her 28th birthday on April 25th. She loves seafood so after reading all the reviews about Wildfish I thought I would give it shot. The place is everything that people said in the other reviews. It is a pretty fancy place but not snooty. I would've gave this place 5 stars, but they didn't give my girlfriend the free sushi roll that I heard about. Even though there was a table right next to us also celebrating a birthday and she got it. But they did give my girlfriend a free desert. The food was some of the best seafood ive ever had in AZ. the bacon wrap shrimp we had for an appetizer exploded with flavor the moment it hits your tongue. I had the Louisiana red fish with a light chive butter sauce. The whole meal was just right, not heavy or oily at all. Had it with the mac & cheese truffle that also was really good. I had to growl at my girlfriend when she tried to sneak a bite. She had the crab stuff shrimp and a twice baked potato. She kept going on about how good it was. For desert we got the pineapple upside down cake everyone raved about. And it didn't disappoint. I let my girl take the first bite since she was the birthday girl and when she took that first bite. She made a orgasmic face that made me kind of jealous lol. But when I took a bite I knew why she made it lol. We will definitely be going back there in the future. Expect to pay about $50 minimum per person. And try to make alittle crumby mess on the table. The waiter has a little thing called a crumber that he uses to scrape up the crumbs. My girl and I got a laugh out of it. The only negative I would give would be that the waiters came by alittle too frequently for our taste that we didn't get a chance to really enjoy our dinner before they came around again and again. Shout out to the people next to us who also had a birthday that same day. And when they found out it was my girls birthday the whole table sang her happy birthday. Very nice of them to do that.
2	Came in looking for envelopes for our wedding invitations.  They had a great selection of different papers, envelopes, and other fun items.  We found some envelopes that we liked, but we wanted to see if they had them in any different colors.  The salesperson told us to come back the following day to speak with Nancy about ordering some.  We did, and when we met Nancy she seemed irritated to have to meet with us.  She was dismissive, crass, and short with us... everything you would NOT want in a salesperson.  She said the envelopes did not come in a different color (though she didn't bother to check), suggested a smaller envelope, and when we told her our invites wouldn't fit in smaller envelope, she made it sound as if it were OUR fault (and told us, in a not-so-nice manner, to just trim our invitations down).  She absolutely did NOT go out of her way to help the customer. Needless to say, we had no interest in doing business with them after that and bought our envelopes elsewhere.\n\nNice store, nice selection, but they have one horrendous salesperson that knocked my rating down at least two stars.
4	I've been to Totts a few times now. I've dined in and carried out. I really enjoy the food here. I've tried a few different items, but my favorite dish is the Pan Fried Noodles served with beef.  The mixture of the noodles covered with beef, veggies and the oyster sauce is terrific. This item is FANTASTIC in my opinion! Each time I finish the dish, I wish I had more! \n\nThe staff is super nice and always go over your order to make sure you receive the items you requested.\n\nOne item that I've tried that I wasn't keen on was the Tom Yum Soup. The soup was spicy, but was about it. Nothing filling about it.\n\nThe food has always came quickly when I've dined in. Both times I've picked up for carryout, the food was ready as advertised. The food is usually ready for pick up within 10 minutes of your order. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable. Each main dish is generally between $6.50 and $9.00. Items with seafood will be a bit more expensive, maybe a bit over the $9 mark\n\nA very good meal for under $10 (excluding drink)
3	This place probably gets the best lineup of bands in the Valley year-in and year-out. Owner Kimber Lanning is such a sweetheart and is constantly fighting to make Phoenix cool. This little shack of a venue (seriously, it fits about 43 people comfortably) has a decent sound system for its size, and a funky interior to boot. It's all ages all the time, so don't expect any sip and there's no BYOB option. This place can be hotter than a sauna in the middle of the summer (I don't care if there's a box fan or two) and is usually righteously loud. Whatever you do, skip the bathroom at all costs...run to the Krispy Kreme across the street.
4	We came here for happy hour and although it was a tad bit difficult to find we're glad we made the extra effort to find it.  Cute quaint restaurant with very good and reasonable items on their happy hour menu.  We got the Falafel mee Tahini, greek nachos, hummus, and greek fries.  My favorite was the greek nachos.  This was more than enough to feed both my husband and I with left overs to take home.  We'll definitely be back!
4	I have always loved this airport just for its poetic name.  We discovered the first really good sit-down airport restaurant here in the 80s.  We flew out of Oakland to Phoenix the afternoon of the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 and I will always remember flying back a week or so later and seeing piles of donated goods the people of Phoenix had dropped off to be transported to the Bay Area free by Southwest for earthquake victims.  When daughter and granddaughter were living in Phoenix Alan and I flew here every other month to see them (except for the summer months...did that once and never again!) so this is a very familiar airport.  It's huge, 4 terminals in contrast to Tucson's one, but it's easy to get around and the security staff have always been friendly.  It's clean and attractively decorated.  Now they have free wifi, an excellent innovation.  The overhead announcements are in a mellow male voice, no knife-voiced woman as in Oakland.\n\nI almost forgot to mention one of my favorite things, the taxiway that crosses over the freeway.  I didn't notice whether we did it today;  I was too tired.  That's always been a little highlight for me.
2	Good deals for cheap food - recently they had a $2 breakfast special consisting of two egg & cheese burritos with hashbrowns.  Hard to beat that.\n\nThis location suffers from one major flaw - that it is located alongside a busy road in the parking lot of a Home Depot.  So, this means there are tons of... let's say... loiterers.  When a patrol car occasionally makes a round through here, the loiterers all scramble into Del Taco or run in various directions.  They also stare at your car in the parking lot if it happens to be nice.\n\nSo, drive your beater if you eat here, and don't eat here if you're bothered by a lot of loiterers outside.
5	I have been searching for a nice, down-to-earth dental practice since I moved to the valley 5 years ago and I think I found it  with Alameda Dental Care! My first dentist was barely scraping by and I felt like they were pushing extra procedures on me to keep the lights on. My next dentist had 2 TVs in every room and had remolded his  waiting room to look like a Vegas casino. Every time I went in I felt like my bill got larger and larger. \n\nMy friend recommended this practice and during my first appointment I felt so comfortable talking to the hygienist and the dentist I knew that I had found what I had been looking for. I have this irrational fear that my teeth are going to fall out at any moment and they were so nice about all my crazy questions. \n\nI even compared the rates for the same recommended procedures to my previous dentist and Alameda Dental Care was about 25% cheaper than them. AND ADC is in my insurance network and my last dentist wasn't, and never bothered to tell me (which is partially my fault for not checking, but also annoying)\n\nI have now had an extensive consultation and two deep cleaning sessions done at Alameda Dental Care and all my visits have been great. I haven't had to wait too long and everyone is so friendly. I highly recommend them to all yelpers!
3	I love the clean, cold modern atmosphere and long booths.  There's a spacious, airy feel.  Beers are above average, with at least one seasonal beer and several guest taps.  The new flatbread pizza appetizers are quite good, and although the pizza isn't a traditional Chicago thick crust, it still makes for a good thick crust pizza.  I like the calzones as well, though $13 for the bigger one is really up there in price considering that is the normal size at other places, and they don't charge $13.\n\nHowever, they are way overpriced.  $4.75 for a 16 oz. pint of beer is a bit steep, pizzas are at least a dollar or two higher than elsewhere, and even with the lunch specials we find that the tab for two people is always $50-60.  This is for casual pizza/brewpub dining, and we're not drinking a lot.
5	"""There's absolutely noting bad and every thing' great about Cowboy Ciao. From a novel of a wine list to the unique creations flowing from the kitchen, bring the date, throw a party or just hit the bar. This is a must when in the area.\n\nMy original reservation through OpenTable was for 4 at 8 PM on a Thursday based solely on Yelp reviews. I was on business in the area and wanted an escape. After talking up the unique menu, interest sparked and I called to up the table to 10. The staff said they could make it happen at 8:30. By 7 the interest had grown to 19 and we have a full blown party on our hands. I was nervous but Ciao  came through. 2 tables were needed 14 and 5, but we were right next to each other. 5/5 for accommodating us on short notice. The restaurant was packed too.\n\nTime to get our drink on. Cocktails were flowing but I was more intrigued by the huge wine list. The size of a Steven King novel and equally as scary until the waited explained the layout. Arranged by price with sections for \Featured Winemakers\"""" it was surprisingly easy to follow. \""""Two bottles of Santa Barbara County Pinot please\"""".\n\nGreat service and the amazing wine list beware, time for food. Not wanting to commit to a Big Place as it's called, I decided hit the Grazing section for sustenance. \nCiao Mixed Greens with smoked tomato vinegerette started off the festivities followed by Abs of Squeal: curried Berkshire pork belly, grilled, with Thai chile/cucumber salad, chile oil, sweet soy and Seared Scallops over a Beet Risotto served with dill cream sauce and goat cheese. Outstanding! Beet risotto? Never heard of it but now I'm going to try and recreate it. Food portions are huge so if you with a Big Plate, you may not even need a starter. Others enjoyed the massive New Zealand Lamb Loin and Pork Rib Chop stuffed with Shropshire blue cheese. Dessert was a delicious White Chocolate Brownie and a Bread pudding.\n\nFive out of five does not express my gratitude to the front of the house staff who made our, spur of the moment, party a huge success and to the chef who's creations were unique and mouth watering. My only disappointment is that I'm not in Scottsdale more often to enjoy Cowboy Ciao."""""""
5	MENU\nThey only have a very small menu of appetizers but they're actually pretty tasty.  I love the brie and the spinach dip and am not quite sure how they manage to do it without a real kitchen.  They also allow you to order in from Thai Basil or Tessio's Pizza in their complex.  I recommend both.  Although, please don't get double Thai spicy and drink beer with it.  It's a bad idea.  Trust me.  \n\nTHE BEER\nUh-mazing variety.  They have a cooler with all the beers they sell and about 8 beers that rotate on tap, including a good variety of 10%'ers.  They regularly stock Rogues, Lagunitas, Left Hand, and Sierra Nevada's more obtuse varieties among lots of other craft beers.  They do a good job of keeping the tap full of very different-tasting beers and keeping my palate in rotation.  Yum.  Rarely dislike their tap choices.\n\n\nCLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY\nNew, clean, cute.\n\nSERVICE\nI love the bartenders here.  They're all attentive and great at their jobs and never get irked when you want to taste something.  Plus, if you order at the bar, they'll still bring it out to you at a table.  \n\nATMOSPHERE\nSort of bare bones wine bar atmosphere BUT always stocked with great art.  They have a new artist every month and I'm almost always into them.
5	Wow!  I can't believe I'm giving 5 stars to a place in Chandler, Arizona!  I'm from NYC and I need to maintain my snob status....but we had such a fabulous time, I can't help it!!\n\nSetting - I totally forgot we were in a parking lot!  The 5 of us were hanging out in the back, sitting around a fire on cozy couches, enjoying a perfect April evening.  \n\nServer - very nice, even helpful when my 4 year old daughter spilled wine all over the place!  Did not feel rushed in the least in a good, relaxed way.  \n\nFood - we had the scallops, fish, olives, meats and cheese platter, 3 kinds of bruschetta - all was wonderful, tasty, well prepared and artistically arranged on each plate.   I was really surprised how the fish just melted in my mouth, great job!  \n\nWine - pretty good wine selection and a good price by the bottle and glass. \n\nThanks for a great Arizona night out!  It was better than all the subsequent nights that we had out in uppity Scottsdale later in the week!
4	I went to Sushi Roku for lunch one day in LA and wasn't a big fan.  Since they opened in Scottsdale though and I love sushi, I thought I would give it another try.  It was only the second weekend they have been open so considering we had to wait an hour for our reservation wasn't so bad because the whole world seemed to be there so talking to everyone made the time pass quickly.  I didn't even think I was in Scottsdale.  Just watching the crowded scene at Sushi Roku and the W Hotel was enough to keep anyone occupied.  They offered us the sushi bar at one point but we opted to wait for a table since it was more of where the action seemed to be.  We got our table and instantly started eating because 1. The table sitting next to us starting sharing their sweet potato chips with us and 2. They brought us edamame without us even ordering it (that scores huge with me)!  At this point since we had waited for a while we weren't starving so we ordered the baked lobster roll and the yellowtail sashimi with diced chilies.  I was hesitant about ordering the lobster roll because I thought it would be heavy and it was actually the opposite - very light.  The yellowtail was so unbelievable I could eat it everyday, all day.  Now the table on the other side of us starting sharing their filet mignon wrapped in asparagus which was very tasty.  They also started pouring us their sake as well which was great!  The ahi tuna carpaccio arrived compliments of the owner as well as a dessert.  All of the desserts sounded so good we told our waitress to surprise us.  She brought some type of egg rolls with ice cream but we were too full to eat them so we reciprocated and gave them to the table next to us.  Our waitress for a new restaurant was perfect.  She was nice, friendly and knowledgeable.  The owner came to sit with us as we were finishing up and was asking ideas of where to possibly open a Boa Steakhouse (also one of LA's amazing restaurants that Innovative Dining Group owns).  I was so excited and told him that Scottsdale Quarter would be the perfect place for Boa.  Now we started our venture to the W Hotel Pool Bar.  To be able to describe all of this would definitely need its own review.  It was a little chaotic at first (with the line, etc - but we ended up only having to wait five minutes), but it turned out to be such a fun night.  I can't wait to go back and hope it stays this way for a while (not because it just opened).   It was fun running into so many people there as well all in a new atmosphere which was very cool.  I loved the pool!  I'll leave it at that and let Gabi write more on this since I wrote about Sushi Roku :)
5	"""Melrose Pharmacy is one of those really cute diamonds in the cenpho area. i stopped in here on the last melrose block party with some friends, one needed to get a percription filled and we saw this place and said \yup lets try it\"""" it was soooo cool. lots of little wind up toys and books and other typical pharmacy type items stocked on what looked like 5ft book shelves. the pharmacist was really nice, chatty, and helpful to my friends needs. filled her script in 10 minutes while we milled around the store. they even accept a wide selection of insurances and everything was nothing more then a pleasant experience...i almost wish something was wrong with me so i could have a perscription to fill too. oh well. when i do i will be taking it here for sure. 5 stars for just awesomeness."""""""
4	Now here's a little story I'd like to tell about a one Chelsea's Kitchen who we know so well. All I can say is that I wish this was my kitchen. The eatery on 40th and Camelback is yet another fun creation by the La Grande Orange family. \n\nI can't believe it's taken me this long to review a top notch spot like Chelsea's. I don't know if it's just me, but every time I visit, if I closed my eyes I can almost pretend that there is a lake just past the comfy outdoor patio. Then I open my eyes and realize that's the canal...dam. But, let's focus on the awesome and not the inevitable here. I like Chelsea's. I do. I've been for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every time I visit, I'm happily satisfied and pleased. \n\nHave you had the Chelsea's burger? No? Go right now. Go... order one. It's burgerlicious. It has the special sauce aka thousand island dressing. It has a crispy buttery bun and freshly cooked meat. And the french fries. OMG, the french fries. So french fries might be my weakness and I try to avoid ordering them at all costs, but at Chelsea's I lose all control of my willpower. \n\nHave you tried the fish tacos? Expensive you say? Why yes, yes they are astronomically high in price. But once you save your pocket change and make the big plunge into your wallet, it'll be worth it. I assure you my friend, it will be worth it. Check out the swordfish tacos or if you're really in a Daddy Warbucks mood, try the Lobster ones. The fresh guacamole, the taco sauce, the fresh pico de gallo and the fish...yum. \n\nAnd the last item to be highlighted during my sonnet aux Chelsea's will be the Chicken Nachitos. Yes, I know. Nachos? Boring! But, these are a pile of heaping, crunchy and massive chips, cheese, meat, salsa, avocado, beans and who knows what else. It's a great way to start your 5,000 calorie meal. You won't be sorry. Your diet might make you sorry, but during the very moment you consume them...you will not be sorry. \n\nFor the healthier options, my suggestions include the shrimp ceviche and the Del Mar Salad. I heart avocados as if you can't tell already...and both of these dishes have their fair share of the good green stuff itself. \n\nThe end.
1	"""\No Vegans Allowed\"""", reads a sign posted just above the entrance and narrated by a middle aged man in slow motion usually working for charlie brown. Okay, maybe not, but it should be there. The only thing truly vegan on the menu is the guacamole, so they claim. The pastas all have cheese, even just red sauce pasta (they cook the cheese into the sauce), my sources reveal. The only reason I find myself at Oregano's is if one of my friends is getting a melted chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on it, which, to be honest, looks delicious."""""""
4	Very fun way to enjoy sushi and other Japanese dishes! Every table has the opportunity to grab dishes coming by, and they are all priced at $5 or less (although nobody at our table got an item over $3). So, the prices are very reasonable! Our server was also very attentive and friendly. This is a great place to go if you are trying to satisfy your sushi craving!\n\nIt's a little set off from the street, so it can be a bit difficult to find. Worth the find though!
5	My husband and I really enjoy our date nights at the Melting Pot. It can be expensive if you get the big meals like the Big Night Out (I would never suggest this for just 2 people - to me it feeds more like 4 people; all you have to do is add 2 more salads to it and it's great for 4). Anyways, the happy hour deals are good and certainly help to make it more affordable so that is what we do more often. I also suggest checking out the specials they have that make a night out with friends affordable as well. \nThe staff is always friendly and I've never had any issues with the several times we've gone. If you've never been and you enjoy cheese and chocolate, give it a try. Plan on spending $30-50/person incl. drinks (unless it's happy hour when it'll be less). I wouldn't suggest this place for kids as they have hot surfaces and pans to worry about.
4	"""See that guy down below, that's going to rate this place one or two stars solely based on the fact that it's a chain restaurant? Same guy that's going to tell you that he is an authority on what true New York Pizza should be, and that this ain't it? Yeah, well...that's me. I'm that guy, only...my first visit here, doesn't give me the fuel I need to tear this place apart. It was good. Really good. What can I say? Sometimes you just have to say, get over yourself and sometimes even chains, come through. I've never been to any of the others, your mileage may vary. (particularly if your also that guy..ehem *cough*lying to yourself* cough) \n\nHalf order of Zucchini Sticks ($3.99) perfectly breaded, crunchy, not greasy, served with ranch and marinara.\n\n14\ Brooklyn Family Pizza (Thin Crust Of course) ($16.09) delicious, thin, crisp, just enough give to make it slightly chewy, but firm enough and thin enough to fold in half. Pepperoni, Sausage & Basil if i remember correctly. The Misses said she preferred her sausage in crumbles not sliced like pepperoni, but this is a personal preference. I was good with it.\n\nTiramisu ($5.99) certainly not the best we've ever had, but more importantly, considering the locale...definitely not the worst.\n\nPint of Santan Hefeweizen ($4.75) Seriously, If we don't support our local brews and vino, who will? Santan in Chandler makes good brew, and you got to give props to NYPD for showing the love.\n\nTotal for Pizza Love for Two: $31.72 I know, I know...its not Dominos pricing, but keep in mind we had an app, dessert, and a pint. Keep it in perspective.\n\nI've seen some complaints about service here, not from me...but then we came at a slow period of the day. Our server Jessica was a bundle of smiles and prompt and courteous. \n\nBottom line. Believe the hype. Don't be that guy. It's good."""""""
4	This is the my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. I started going here at a previous job based on coworkers' recommendations, and quickly fell in love with this gem.\n\nWhen you enter it's like being culturally transported to central Mexico. \n\nThe servers are fast and attentive, and there are always specials and new items. Prices are totally fair, too.\n\nI enjoy that you get a cup of soup with every meal, and the soup itself varies by day. I always get the enchiladas or a tostada - both are great.\n\nYou'll definitely have leftovers - and if you go here during the workday, don't plan on being super productive after eating here, you'll head to food coma alley rapidly.\n\nFor authentic, delicious food this is the place to be. Note - I think they're closed Mondays.
3	"""I was stoked to find real Philly cheese steak place. They defiantly look the part. But the sandwich, although it was tasty, it didn't have much meat on it!! Especially for $6.59 for a ten incher. I felt like I had eaten a six inch sub with double bread. If I ever come back I guess I'd have to spring for double meat. They did however have \Tasty Cakes\"""" just like back East. You can't beet a good \""""Butterscotch Krimpet\""""!"""""""
1	This is a KFC and a Taco Bell combined.  This is the closest taco bell to my area and after the last 4x in a row of getting my order wrong I won't ever go back and have lost faith in Taco Bell at other locations also.  \n\nThe drive thru is extremely slow all hours of the day.  The employees are grumpy and no smiles are to be seen. Don't dare tell them your order was wrong because they will let you know that YOU must have ordered it incorrectly. \n\nKFC has the smallest pieces of chicken I have ever seen. Mini chicken farmers must be where they purchase their products. A thigh was about the size of a chicken wing at a pizza parlor.  It's often over fried also. \n\nTaco Bell my order is ALWAYS wrong. I like extra sauce... If I ask for it I will get NO sauce at all... Every time without fail. So I stated asking for green sauce on the side so I could get my extra sauce.. I have to explain to them to just put it in a container. It's not rocket science. I rarely make special requests like this but if I purchase extra sauce and don't get it this to me is being an untrustworthy company.   I Ussually have missing items, never give napkins in the drive thru either.  My last time there I got someone else order... It was a very large order and I just drove off with it. I was so feed up with the BS and mistakes I kept it. I ordered a burrito and got a meal for 4 LOL.
1	"""On name alone, we HAD to check this place out, just for kicks.\n\nOuch!\n\nBandaids indeed; this place hurts and not in a good way. And you might want to spritz that with some iodine for good measure.\n\nI've got no qualms with talent, don't get me wrong. The female form is a beautiful thing to behold in all of its varied curve-tastic shape and form. A woman is a woman is a beautiful woman, and I'm a sucker. By default, naked womanhood warrants an automatic 3-star baseline from me, but the slummy and desperate atmosphere in this dive is a soulsuck for all that dare enter.\n\nThe squat brick building sits all by its lonesome under that tacky illuminated \Bandaids Show Lounge\"""" sign, the surrounding parking lot emanating with \""""Damn, I'mma get mugged out here\"""" uncertainty and darkness.\n\nOnce inside (yes, you go in through the sketchy looking front door that looks as welcoming as the sketchy looking service door), you're met by security and carded; the girls headed for the bar, another friend and myself were subjected to a [sub-standard*] pat downs - *sub-standard, the folding knife clipped and visible in my front pocket (CA law) went unnoticed.  A printed \""""no sideways caps, no baggy/saggy jeans, no long tees\"""" dress code tacked by the door. Classy!\n\nAfter getting a few beers from the pretty bartender (she was actually really really good-looking, hottest girl on staff, setting a false precedent for what the talent would look like), we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge, finding a couple of tables near, but not next, to the center stage.\n\nMost of us sat talking and laughing with each other, occasionally glancing at the stage just to see what's up, and watching the depraved humanity of the other patrons in the place, empty on a Friday night...\n... the out-of-towner business man in the dark corner, getting dances from any girl that would come his way.\n... the mouth-breather waiting with stalker-ish anticipation for a dance with one of the, er, amply-bossomed strippers.\n... the table of youngins, dressed exactly how the posted dress code prohibited.\n\nGirl after girl (a couple+ of \""""a'ight\"""" girls, most \""""everyday\"""" girls, and at least one \""""is that a girl?\"""") came to the stage, gyrated to cliche strip club music, some exhibiting gymnast caliber pole skills and limberness, then cruised the showroom floor, peddling their wares with a repeated-to-monotone-perfection \""""Would you like a dance?  Would you like a dance?\"""".\n\nNone of us partook in the festivities, but two friends in an adjoining party did.  One, quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it.  The other, a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist Afghanistan, got one of the [few] Barbies who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs... and about $100.\n\nAfter a quick 30 minutes, we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of \""""meh\"""" talent and skeevy behavior.  And that's when we saw it...\n...the epitome of tacky divey strip club attire...\n...the summation of the Bandaids experience...\n...that's when we saw it... \n\n...The HOOD-KINI*!\n\nIt was time to leave... quickly. As we braved the parking lot,  it was joke after FirstAid and Infectious disease related joke. Automatic hilarity at the mere mention during the rest of our trip.\n____________________\nYes, yes.

4	I went here with my husband for my birthday because, while I may be 24, I am still a kid at heart who loves dinosaurs and history. I don't think I've been to this museum since I was a little kid, but I have fond memories of field trips here, and as an adult this place did not disappoint.\n\nFrom the moment you walk in the door, you can see cool dinosaur skeletons. It's far from an empty lobby, and the museum atmosphere is apparent immediately. A quick study of the map after paying the admission price and you'll get an idea of the best path to take around the museum.\n\nCurrently the museum has a special exhibit about the Therizinosaur. It's a cool exhibit. Besides that, there are dinosaur skeletons, the old territorial prison, Native arts and crafts, and an awesome waterfall/flash flood display.\n\nMy only complaint is that the explanations of each exhibit are sometimes a bit long and wordy (especially in the Therizinosaur exhibit). The info is fascinating but with so much to see, it can be hard to stay still and read the entire thing. Bullet points and the use of bigger headlines that summarize the exhibits more clearly could be useful.
4	I had the BLT burger, it was tasty!  The burgers are served alacarte, which was just fine due to the ginormous size of the burger.  It was so large that I had to ditch the bun, which was a beautiful buttery masterpiece.  The grilled onions were perfect, sweet and delicious.  The patty was cooked to a perfect medium rare but was a little to dense for my liking.  They charged me $3 for a coke, a little steep for soda.  The bill came to $14.25 with just a soda and burger, little to much for a burger and soda with no sides.  The room was a bit to dark and the music was blaring, I hurried to finish my burger.  The wait staff was very attentive and not over bearing.  The burger was great but I don't think I'll return just because of the price.  I realize it's North Scottsdale but it's a little ridiculous.
3	3.5 stars, but the best sushi I've had in Az so far.  And by sushi, I'm not talking about deep fried rolls with lots of sauce or hot sauce on them.  I'm talking about the fish.  The saba wasn't the normal crappy saba you get in Az.  It was mildly strong (i.e., perfect).  The shiro mutsu was buttery and very fresh.  The hamachi was the best hamachi I've had in a while, including all of my sushi eating in the Bay area.  Good hot appetizers as well (e.g., agedashi tofu).  Service was good and the tables were wobbly.  I'll be back if I have a sushi craving while I'm in Az.
4	Had a hunger itch we needed to scratch, so we ventured here on a late Sunday morning and let me tell you my friends...the itch was scratched...it was scratched feverishly well. Ok, enough metaphorical jib jab...I'll get to the point here...Scratch was wonderful.\n\nWe went there on a blazing hot Sunday afternoon, looking for a little refuge from the heat...and of course a satisfying late breakfast. It was a little hard to locate at first...there's a lot of construction in the area, so if you aren't paying attention you'll miss it. It's in a really unassuming strip mall-ish location...the strip mall itself is surrounded by all sorts of retirement homes and centers, if you go into the Fry's next door I can almost guarantee that if you're under the age of 50, you'll be one of the youngest people there...so it's a bit odd that this trendy hip bakery/bistro is located here...I certainly can't imagine any retirees feeling too comfortable eating at a place like this (or maybe I just haven't met enough 'hip' older people). \n\nWe ended up trying a breakfast sandwich (served up on a yummy croissant roll), eggs florentine, a crepe (with sugar and French butter), and a red velvet cupcake to top it all off. Everything was very fresh and had a crisp taste...both the breakfast sandwich and the eggs florentine seemed to focus much more on quality than quantity, which I always appreciate since I don't like huge portions, but would much rather savor a smaller meal...but this being said; be forewarned if you are into big portions, a single menu item here may not fill you up. The crepes were probably my favorite thing we tried...cooked to perfection and filled with some sort of rock sugar which just complimented the crepe with butter really well...it's pretty much a dessert, but I can't help but recommend it as an addition to whatever else you may try here no matter what time of the day it is. Lastly, the red velvet cupcake was just sort of okay. We've yet to find somewhere who can make a cupcake as good as Tammie Coe...but that isn't Scratch's specialty, so I can't fault them too much for it. \n\nOverall, Scratch is pretty reasonable for the quality of food you're getting (at least for the breakfast menu we had). This is yet another time when I wondered why anyone in their right mind would go to Denny's or Coco's when you can get fresher, healthier, and much much tastier food at a place like Scratch for about the same price. Makes me wanna go over to one of these chain breakfast places and bitch slap anyone who gives their hard earned money to an inferior product. \n\n4/5.
4	A bowl of rice and a very nice price and and alot of spice is what makes me come here.\n\nI can get a Salmon bowl with brown rice and and a ton of hot spice for less than $7. \n\nWalk in there is a line leading up to the some registers and meny board on the wall, the usual Jap fair chiken teriaki bowls etc, options for all while meat and the like.\n\nI got for the salmon bowl $5.99, a great way to have fish that is not fried at a decent lunch price. I find the teriaki sauce a bit much so I order light on the sauce. for $.25 more you can upgrade to the health factor of brown rice.\n\nGet your bowl and head to the condiment area, there is hot chilli powder, sauce and sliced green onion. I really appreciate the onions.\n\nI think some of the low scores come from the fact japanese food just does not have the flavor punch that Chinese and Thai do.
4	"""So far (after two visits) I love it here.  Armed with a menu, I called down to place a \to go\"""" order.  You can't begin to imagine my delight when the guy answered the phone in a French accent so thick it was hard to understand.  I placed my order for the \""""half sandwich and side\"""" deal (extremely reasonable at $5.60) and ran down to get it.  I ordered the mozzarella sandwich minus the prosciutto, and the pasta salad for the side.  Regular readers may know that in my opinion, nothing beats a good mozzarella sandwich, so I was absolutely thrilled to find that it was delicious.  Nice crunchy baguette, fresh mozzarella, and flavorful tomatoes.  The pasta salad was also very good... very simple, just cold pasta with some olive oil and seasonings.  I'm not a super adventurous eater, so while I loved the pasta salad I would guess that others might find it a tad boring.\n\nToday I had the tomato basil ravioli soup, which was very good except that it was a little skimpy on the raviolis.  Flavor was delicious, though.  It comes with a few toasted slices of baguette.  Personally, next time I'll just order a fresh baguette to go along with it.\n\nThe entrees and full sandwiches are a little more pricey, but I'm a light eater, so the half sandwich/side deal is an absolute steal for me.  There's not a sandwich on the menu that doesn't sound mouth watering, and the desserts.... oh my god I wanted one of each.  Add in the extremely friendly service (who said Frenchmen were rude??) and I'm happy to say i've found my new lunch spot.\n\nEdited to add:  As far as I can tell, they're open in the evenings too, so next time yo find yourself seeing a movie at the Esplanade, stop by Au Petit Four (right by the escalators) for some yum."""""""
5	Awwwhhh, I LOVE this place!\n\nPart of what I love about Yelp and being a part of the Yelpyness is discovering little places off the beaten path. Sure, I will occasionally get my McDee's Sausage McMuffin on or even crack for the Endless Shrimp deal at Red Lobster, but what I love more than anything are the little mom and pop's, the hole in the walls and places like Palatte.\n\nWhen we headed over here today, I honestly thought my friend got lost. Hey, it's her town and what do I know, I am just visiting, so you will hear no backseat driver antics out of me. Finally we pulled up to this little house in the middle of a residential area and voila...brunchtastic fun at its finest.\n\nI don't even want to venture a guess at how crowded this place must get on the weekends judging by how busy it was at 11:30 on a Friday, but if you have the patience, definitely stop in here. The atmosphere is great, the people working here are super cool, the cooks have tats (yay!) and the food is awesome!\n\nI ordered the Potato, which basically translates to eggs, bacon, caramelized onions, gouda cheese and fresh fruit and yummy lightly buttered sourdough toast. It was just like something you'd make at home...if you were a really good chef and awesome :) Tasty, filling, but didn't have me feeling that after breakfast lull like most brunch places can.\n\nIf I lived in Phoenix this would be a must stop and quite often. Definitely check this out! You will love it!!
5	This place is so unique! I was disappointed that it was closed the weekend of my birthday in July, but I won't hold that against them!\n\nThis bar/boxing ring/vintage store/food truck/soda fountain is super awesome! My cousin took me here a few years ago and since then it's been a place that I always show friends and family members when they want to go out downtown. The drink list is pretty extensive, with lots of organic cocktails served in cute mason jars. You definitely get a good sized drink! The beers are cheap, the food is so-so. I think it's a bit overpriced, so I'd recommend eating somewhere else beforehand. \n\nThe boxing ring is random, but I've seen friends go up there and fight in a drunken stupor, and that is a sight I'll never regret seeing. Some nights they have karaoke, which I've chosen to partake in a few times. I've seen DJ's there on the weekends, and I really like how they switch up the music genre each time. Sometimes it's rap, others rockabilly and oldies. On Tuesday nights they do FREE swing dancing lessons and I've been really wanting to try that!\n\ni love the vintage feel to the place and am surprised it's not packed all the time!
4	I like this place. I was looking to DIY my bouquet for my very small wedding, and they happened to be a good combination of easy to locate and well priced. It's in the building that used to hold My Florist- they tore it down and turned it into a bunch of small little stores.\n\nYou go into the store and are greeted by the adorable store kitty. Super friendly and cute! Sorry, but I've got two of my own, they get at least a 0.5 star for that. \n\nMostly I liked how helpful the girl was. I looked a bit lost, and she asked me what I needed, and I asked to look at the fresh flowers, because I wanted white ones for my bouquet. They didn't have many of the ones I really liked or had initially wanted but she did go out of her way to mention that because it was a Saturday, there were some blooms that weren't up to par when I asked about them. Not letting me buy bad flowers- very nice. \n\nWhen I had questions about the hydrangea stems that caught my eye, and voiced that I wasn't sure if I could make my now-husband's boutonniere out of it, she actually showed me, right on the spot. I also loved that. She told me how to care for them until the day of, and we arranged for her to put aside some stems for me on the spot. When I asked if I might need more, she volunteered to call her supplier. They said they could deliver some the next day, but she was very upfront about the price.\n\nI did catch her making a really cool looking arrangement as well. I rather wish I had had the foresight to come in earlier and order what I needed, but flowers were supposedly easy and the last thing on my mind. My problem, not theirs. Good service, small local business, great location. If I actually bought fresh flowers more of ten I'd definitely become a regular.
3	I tried the grill side and was pleasantly surprised about the food.  I tried the couple's steak and lobster (~$65, yum!), the chicken and shrimp (~$30, a-ok), soft shell crab appetizer (~$12, yum!), squid salad (~$12, a-ok), rainbow roll (~$12, meh), and caterpillar roll (~$12).  The lobster was HUGE, the steak was almost satisfactory in terms of quality and the way it was prepped and cooked.  The shrimp were HUGE and the portions were more than generous.  The fried rice was a-ok and the veggies were cooked perfectly.\n\nOther important info: service is friendly and a bit scattered, portions are generous, chef was nice and sometimes funny but most of his jokes and moves were canned (VERY SIMILAR TO BENIHANA'S, if you've ever been), and ample parking.
5	Everything is delicious!! I always could not decide which one to have for the day. If you love bread, this is the place for it. If you love cake, this is the place for it. If you love love sweet/dessert, this is the place for it.\n\nAt the Masuri Festival, they were so nice....they made the beef teriyaki sandwich for me even though they already started to pack up their stuff to end the festival. Thanks a lot and it was yummy.
5	Yo, you like Chinese food right? And of course you love Mexican food, you're in Arizona. Then you will LOVE this place. The wonderful place combines two fantastic food genres and makes them fantasticer by combining them. You can get Jade Chicken in a burrito! Or in a quesadilla! Even if you don't want to combine Mexican food with Chinese food, eating them in a more traditional (?) way is still an amazing treat. \n\nYou can take the food to go and sit down inside. The restaurant setting is a little bare bones but they bring your food to your table so it comes out even? You also get a free cookie so that's awesome!\n\nPossibly the best thing about this place is the mascot. It's probably the most racist mascot ever. Panda wearing a sombrero with six shooter. Ridiculous and I love it
4	I love Stinkweeds, it might be small, but it is packed with tons of great music.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, they let you do your own thing, but they are completely approachable if you have any questions.  I have enjoyed seeing some of the in-store performances they have.  I also love the fact that they have promotional material for new releases, and I have gotten quite a few posters there.  I almost always buy my concert tickets there as well, I will gladly support Stinkweeds when I can.\n\nThe only complaint I have is when it gets busy in there, it is incredibly difficult to move around and it can get pretty hot in there.  I do have to admit I miss the other locations.
3	I have loved this building in downtown Phoenix ever since I moved here.  To see the owners working to fix it up rather than tear it down and build some new modern structure was very exciting, but it sure took a long time to open.  Finally it was open and we dashed there right away.   \n\nGreat design and I loved the place.   The only issue, and it is a big one for me because it is the reason for going there, is that the drinks are small & the prices are high.   Hopefully there will be changes in the future cause I really like the place and find it a nice, trendy downtown location!  Editing this as I think my initial star rating was not really fair...it is more 2.5 to 3 star...so 3 it is!
2	My friend and I decided to stop by and get something to eat after we got done shopping. I usually eat at the actual resturant instead of inside the mall. I ordered the garlic dip and a side of seasoned chicken, my friend ordered the chicken del sol. All these are my favorites everytime I dine at Pita. I don't know if its just because its located in the mall and they don't have everything that the actual menu does at the resturant. The seasoned chicken had way too much seasoning on it. The chicken del sol looked different and tasted way different, they did not put the chipotle sauce on the cheese pita.
4	Time flies when you're having fun...\nIt's been almost a full year since my initial review of Bacon, and I've been back probably ten times or more.\n\nI've seen a lot of transition with the employees but I can say that their service has gotten much better since the beginning.  The casual atmosphere is right up my alley for a weekend breakfast, and my yogi omelette / protein pancake orders have stayed consistent too.  \n\nI was there earlier today and while the service was spot-on, I did find a piece of ham in my otherwise veggie omelette - but I overlooked it and enjoyed my meal nonetheless...\n\nMy husband has been to Bacon even more than i have, and he told me he recently sampled what's to come on their new lunch menu (think pastrami sandwich).  So, go for breakfast, go for lunch, go for a Bloody Mary or a Mimosa... just kick back and enjoy your meal!
5	Local indie handmade ice cream, the perfect late night treat after a show downtown.  Low key atmosphere, friendly and attentive service with an owner/operator that clearly takes tremendous pride in serving up a quality product.  He provided info on his late night hours of operation(till 2am on fri/sat!) and made sure to add that if I ever get a craving for delicious ice cream during the day, then the Fair Trade daytime crew will be more than happy to scoop some up for me.  \n\nThis is the ice cream I remember from childhood...dense, deeply flavorful and melts to a creamy consistency.  Old fashioned goodness with contemporary flavors like spicy chocolate, mango, horchata plus classics like butter pecan.  Cant resist mixin' and matchin' flavors in the cup when i go in.  Forget the air filled ice milk grocery store crap, and go for something heavenly and original from Sweetness instead, the next time you have an ice cream craving.
1	"""They do a great job on the haunted house, but look, let's talk value.  The price of admission for the haunted house, $25.  The price of a \town pass\"""" another $15.

4	I've been to Over Easy three times now, twice pre-DDD (and Yelp membership) and one post.  We had a family member in town and we met up for breakfast one Sunday morning with a medium sized group.  We weren't the first to arrive, and the first people arriving already had staked out a table for us, so no wait for us.  \n\nThe first thing that I noticed was that the menu seemed a lot heartier than my first two visits (including something on the menu that appeared as if it was trying to be a challenge for Man V. Food).  While it doesn't bother me particularly that they expanded the menu, I didn't really see why they needed to change from the simple menu they had.  And no JPO coffee???  (Ok, so the coffee was probably still the same, but I still liked the whole 'JPO' part).  \n\nAnyways, I had the basic brioche french toast with a side of tater tots (big plus for having tots).  It was good, not spectacular.  The tots were ample, so I appreciated that.  Service was good.  It did seem to get a bit warm, but we were in the 'outdoor' section, so that was to be expected.  \n\nProbably closer to 3.5 stars, but this was my 3rd time there, and I would go back, so I'm rounding up to 4 stars...I think it was the tots that put them over the top.
4	"""The first time I went to Rito's, my coworker and I happily drove off, chatting about how we couldn't wait to get back to the office to finally see what all the fuss is about.  Well we truly could NOT wait. We had to pull in at the parking lot of a church, not one block away from there because the aroma was just too much! Honest!\n\nRito's wouldn't be as fun without the Soup-Nazi attitude of the people running the joint.  I think it's hilarious. It's a Phoenix landmark and a MUST for out-of-towners.\n\nAnd they CAN be that way to us. They can require cash only. Make you keep your mouth shut unless ordering EXACTLY what is on the VERY LIMITED menu and nothing more.  As far as ordering goes, I ought to add that the word \ordering\"""" is misleading. We don't \""""order\"""" our lunch at Rito's. We request.\n\nThese people are serious and so am I. I want my bean/cheese/enchilada style and I will do whatever it takes to get it. Don't come with me and get an attitude with them or I'll rip your head off. I will NOT be 86ed from Ritos on account of you! But you can cry on my shoulder as I wolf down my burrito. I understand.\n\nOnly thing I want to correct, which I think is unfair in some other reviews: the neighborhood isn't as bad as people like to say. Yeah there is gang activity, but come on. When was the last time some innocent person just getting their lunch was assaulted or shot in the Garfield neighborhood?  Can't remember? That's because the trouble makers usually make trouble for themselves and each other and don't usually bother the rest of us. \n\nBottom line, if you can't handle central phoenix, stick with your local tacobell/pizzahut/kentuckyfriedchicken drive thru in anthem."""""""
5	5 stars for the wide open spaces! \n\nWe all know that Starbuck's drinks are all standard, pretty much.\nSo when I look at stores I look for the outlets and the tables...I guess also the location.\n\nWhen ever you go into a Starbucks, no matter what location you instantly feel your in a different place...the company's interior design gets me every time, the insistent Feng Shui is just so relaxing and productive. Or maybe its all in my head..ha!\n\nI like this location because of the outlets and the tables...all very accommodating. \n\nI am purest so I don't mess with Carmel frapps or the peppermint mochas...tall coffee or black passion tea for me my coffee artisans of 16th st and BethHome....and let the caffeine pass through my veins...stirring my inner most career ambitions! \n\nl'chaim!    \n\nR\\_

Yeah, so a belt will set you back a few hundred bucks, a bag or a pen even more. My friend made certain that I left with a big girl wallet so I can now be a real professional, or something like that. Well, whatever about the wallet but I LOVE everything else in this beautiful store. Great products and service? Exactly what you want when you're dropping extra on something special.

5	First timer here during the Christmas holiday season. Attended the Desert Botanical Garden with my family in town. I HIGHLY recommend for anyone attending to hands down go through the grounds with the FREE tour. TRUST me on this! You will be enlightened by the information that these tour guides provide. Honestly if my family and I didn't use the tour guide we would have had a completely different opinion of this place. We very much enjoyed it and our tour guide was great! t\n\nKeep in mind there is a lot of walking. Be prepared. Wear comfortable shoes and clothing and maybe have a beverage and snack on hand, just in case. I liked taking my time to view just about everything out there. \n\nSTUDENT DISCOUNT is HONORED at only $10. Normal adult admission is $18. \nGreat savings!

4	Garlic Soy Edamame and Steve! Yup two favorites right off the bat. I met a friend of mine for birthday sushi and drinks as we both wanted to try someplace new. Pearl sushi it is as they have Sushi Gone wild on Tuesdays where if you have a Pearl card, you are able to order from a special sushi menu and have $3 Svedka martini's all night. The card is $5 but you earn points every time you eat there with double points on certain nights. Once you reach 500 points they give you $25 in Pearl Cash to use on food and drinks. Sign me up!! \n\nThe Garlic Soy Edamame was the BOMB! We smelled it as it was being brought out to other diners and we both were like, we want that. I really need to know how to make it as it was VERY good. Steve was a great bartender and he kept our drinks coming. I am telling you, they tasted like fruit punch but those suckers sure had a kick. I woke up this morning with a slight hangover lol. The sushi was pretty good as well and I introduced my friend to some sushi that also had jalapeno in it. Needless to say, he is now a fan of spicy sushi dishes lol. The company, the food, the drinks and the serve was fabulous and I can't wait to come back again. ( I need the points lol)
4	Wow... \nAfter reading the previous CL reviews and hearing from Joel L that he thinks I would like this place and that I must try it, I finally gave in.  I wanted to see if I could really trust Joel's opinion, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about!\n\nI didn't realize that Chestnut Lane was a tiny little spot, nor did I realize that it's the type of place where you order at a counter and then sit down... I must note that they have limited seating.  Luckily, my lunch companion and I met on the later side (1:30 on a Thursday), so we had no problem getting a table outside and luckily, it was in the shade.\n\nWe walked in and I was blown away by how fresh and delicious all of the salads looked in the case... I was torn between the old fashioned egg salad, lobster cobb, chestnut lane chopped, and asian chicken salad... and the farro looked amazing too.  I went with the large version of the lobster cobb and was not disappointed.  It consisted of fresh lobster mixed in with butter lettuce and just the right amount of avocado, tomato, bacon, hard boiled eggs, and a light lemon vinaigrette dressing.  Served with a fresh baguette - it was the perfect lunch.  If it were not so filling, i would've gone back in for a side of farro or one of their scrumptious but healthy sounding pastries.\n\nMy lunch companion had a turkey BLT sandwich on whole-grain bread that was stuffed to the gills with turkey, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and mayo... it looked amazing and he ate the entire thing along with a cup of chicken noodle soup.  \n\nI am quite sure that I'll be back again soon to experience some of the other organic goodness that CL has to offer.  And kudos to Joel L for insisting that I would enjoy Chestnut Lane... I guess you can get to know someone pretty well from their Yelp reviews!
4	We stopped by to try the steamed buns as my better half has a deep infatuation for pork belly (and I short ribs).\nThe server was awesome, very attentive and sweet.\n\nThe steamed buns were pretty delicious!  \n\nIn my opinion, I would take the short ribs meat and put them in place of the pork belly, just to get all the accoutrements...  \nWe also had the Mixed Greens salad which I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nThe drinks looked interesting, will definitely try some out when I'm back for another lunch or dinner!
5	5 stars for the one of the Best Damm Happy Hour's in the Valley. When it comes to doing happy hour there is only one spot that comes to mind, Roaring Fork has the best deals going whether it is the Green Chili, the Flat bread or the Big Ass Burger these items are fantastic and the Prickly Pear Margarita is a must try... this place is a home run, and they are doiting it every night in the bar for the summer, which means Elliot and the gang down there will be seeing a lot more of us..
5	I've been to Vitos about 4-5 times.  I live 45 mins away... Totally worth the drive.\n\nThe bread and zucchini are my fav way to start my meal.. DON'T eat too much because the food is going to make u so full!\n\nThe Deep dish pizza is to DIE for... I admit to being a food snob.  I believe in using good ingredients and creating flavors that you can't get in every other pizza shop.  VITOS is KING!!!!\n\nThey make their own sausage, sooo good, and their sauce isn't too sweet from the basil.  Their crust has some sweetness to it; it is not over powering or distracting to the food.  The sweetness creates a balance to the overall pizza.  The texture is PERFECT!  I'm making myself hungry.\n\nReally, this place is a BIG surprise!  You will love it!\n\nFYI: BYOB, if u want soda or Iced tea they got u covered!
4	"""I have never been to New York. So, I don't know how \New York\"""" this place really is. However, the sandwiches were great!! The menu is a little overwhelming at first.

This immediately brought our attention to that portion of the menu. He got Turkey and I got Chicken Salad both on Challah Bread and we split it. The Chicken Salad was amazing and the turkey was right off the bone like Thanksgiving leftovers. I would recommend this to anyone and plan on going back."""""""
1	Why did I go here again when I've had bad luck in the past?  Went about 2 years ago, food was just OK, service sucked.  2 years later, exact same....\n\nVisited for lunch on a week-day.  Place was very empty.  Service was very slow.  Took an hour for lunch between seating and leaving.  Food was just OK, drinks were empty and the waitress just didn't really seem to care (and she was only handling 2 tables).  $16 for a sandwich and ice tea.
4	Wife and I went for lunch there last week.  We liked it very much and have been here now a total of about five times.  While their lunch buffet might not be spectacular, they have some things that make it worthwhile from our perspective.  My wife likes their fresh fruit offerings, which were fresh, cold, sweet, and very nice.  We love their spicy mayo chicken salad, and some of their curries.  I like their Thai version of Chinese char siu (roasted sweet red pork).  Their pad thai noodles are OK, but they use a little too much vinegar for my taste and the noodles they use are thinner than what I am accustomed to.  But don't get me wrong, the pad thai is still pretty good.
1	What a miserable excuse for an airline.  Why am I reviewing an airline on Yelp?  They are all over and not really a type of place.  But they pissed me off and I am gonna vent all over the Internets.  Just trying to get home from DFW to Phoenix.  First plane had a bad light or something, so they had to transfer us to a new plane.  Another MD-80, what a miserable POS.  (There is a reason why it hasn't been produced in 12 years).  Then their luggage counting system broke so they had to unload all the luggage and reload it.  So, a nice two hour delay sitting at two various gates.  And hat do they offer us for all this trouble: A granola bar.  Woo, that sure makes up for it.\n\nFinally made it to Phoenix and vowed never to fly them again.  Three trips with American Airlines, delays of two hours on two of the three, all mechanical issues.  Just too paranoid how decrepit their fleet is to really trust them again.
3	Skye is an interesting concept. Different rooms with different musical acts playing.....it seems like it would be a fun place to have dinner. But, I just couldn't get comfortable with my surroundings and was eager to wrap up dinner and get home as quickly as I could. \n\nThe food was good, but not great. The Cesar salad was what you'd expect. The chicken breast that I had was, again, mediocre. I will say that the couscous was a highlight of the meal. Still, every time the door to our dining room opened, the music from the adjoining room BLASTED in. I think I may have permanent ear damage. Seriously, the conversation had to stop every time a server walked into our room. \n\nOverall, Skye was 3-stars. Decent food......good service.....overpowering music. If I find myself on the west side at dinner time, I may try it again. But, I won't be going out of my way to eat there anytime soon.
4	We learned of Ortiz Brothers outdoor furniture from an ad they posted on Craigslist. The prices and photos looked good so we thought we would check it out. What we found was an impressive selection of sturdy and attractive chaise lounges and outdoor chairs, love seats and tables. Every bit of the furniture is made on-site, from the wrought iron frames to the all-weather cushions. The employees were friendly and helpful -- they allowed to us to pick the cushions and granite table top we wanted for our furniture set and delivered the furniture to our home for free. The furniture is high quality, and while it's not cheap, it is definitely cheaper than most you'll find at the big patio furniture stores.
4	"""About 5 or 6 years ago, one of my lovely sisters surprised me w/ a lovely jar of Aveda Soothing Aqua Therapy for Christmas.  I'd always wanted to try the product, yet couldn't justify spending $24 on 16 oz. of bath salts (the price has since increased to $30).  The jar was part of a gift package, but Aveda really doesn't offer discounts on its products.  However, I do appreciate that I'm able to customize gift assortments to include specific products I know the person I'm gifting is particular fond of!  [If you''re ever stumped on what to get someone for the holidays, a birthday, or any other special occasion, try your luck at any Aveda location-- all the women I know love Aveda products (some say they don't, but secretly do and just hate having to pay premium prices for them!).  You say \But what if the person I'm gifting is a guy?\""""  Well, I'm going to let you in on a secret-- guys LOVE Aveda-pampering, too!  I know, bec. I've bought hair products, mint soaps, and after shaves from here, and even the most-macho guys grin from ear-to-ear when they find themselves the lucky recipients!  LOL]\n\nAnyhoo, back to that jar of soothing salts I was talking about... I've been rationing my usage of the salts for special occasions, such as when I run out of detoxifying generic Epsom salts*, or when my stash of Aura Cacia Pure Aromatherapy Foam Bath sampler pack doesn't particularly appeal to me at the time.  I am saddened to think that after tonight's wonderful bath, I only have enough for one more blissful soak :(  I know where I could get a brand-new jar for future baths, but some things in life are just more satisfying when they're gifted, don't you agree?  Hmm... Valentine's Day is just around the corner...\n\nI wish I could give this particular location 5 stars, but based on the last few visits (once or twice a year), I really can't, as the prior excellent level of customer service I'd received has considerably depreciated.  Gone are the enthusiastic, yet warm greetings, and rarely, if at all, am I greeted w/ a hot cup of licorice-mint tea, anymore.  But I still love the products, even though I almost-always now get them at Tempe's Moodswings salon...\n\n*Helpful tip:  Epsom salt baths are great after getting massages; a soak helps to significantly mitigate soreness you may sometimes experience after an intense session by reducing inflammation.  I know, bec. I used to say \""""OK/alright\"""" when my ex-therapist would suggest a soak until I finally did one day, and wouldn't you know it, it really did help!  I now almost never go w/out a soak after a session, even if hours may go by before I get the chance!)"""""""
4	This place is nice on a weekend night. Parking can be a hassle, and drinks aren't always the cheapest, but its good to be able to choose from a full bar, and not just beer and wine. Depending on the night there will either be a live band or dj; both are nice and don't stray too far from the mainstream. What this means is the dj isn't gonna play some tracks that sound like cats farting into a microphone. Check out Copper Blues, especially if you're leaving a show at Stand Up Live.
5	The Omakase dinner I had here in early December for my birthday is a meal I will remember for years. I've eaten at two restaurants with three Michelin stars (Paul Bocuse and Le Petit Nice), and at Minibar in Washington, DC. The Omakase by Chef Nobuo was every bit as enjoyable and life changing as those places. It's been about a month, and I can still imagine and remember the taste of each dish in detail. Our Omakase had 9 courses, many consisting of several items:\n\n1. Cold appetizer of radish salad and edamame in sesame sauce\n2. Hot appetizer of fried fingerling potatoes with bonito flakes, and fried octopus ball\n3. Two chawanmushi, one cold flavored with fish and house made ikura, one hot flavored with foie gras.\n4. Sashimi plate with 9 completely different items (took over 30 minutes for Chef Nobuo to assemble this one course)\n5. Wagyu beef grilled over charcoal with miso sauce\n6. Shabu Shabu of red snapper and mushrooms\n7. Red snapper soup (made with Shabu Shabu broth)\n8. Taiwanese Oolong tea service\n9. Dessert of orange mousse, grapefruit sorbet with shiso, and a chocolate custard.\n\nEverything was made by Chef Nobuo (by himself) right in front of your eyes. We ordered a very good sake from their extensive sake menu to accompany the meal. I would have liked it if they had offered a sake flight as an option to the meal, but the bottle we had was great. The only downside to the meal was cost: $400 for two people including the drinks, tax and tip. Not that I think it wasn't worth it or was a bad value, though. It was worth every dime, and given the amount of time and effort it took to serve just 4 customers, a perfectly reasonable value. It's also in line with the cost of the places I mentioned in the beginning of the review. I just wish I could go more often. As it stands, I'll be lucky if I can afford once a year.
3	"""Blue Wasabi is not your traditional sushi bar. The decor, music and menu are trendy and modern. And if you are wondering, yes they do have blue colored wasabi. Now with all that said, if you are more of a traditionalist this place might not appeal to you. You can find some traditional rolls, but most of them are of the \fusion\"""" variety. This restaurant is a decent place to hang out, but I would considerate a \""""sushi bar\"""". When I cannot order fish using their Japanese names it sort of detracts from the ambience of the joint.  Also that blue wasabi takes getting used to. Overall I would have to say food is ok, nothing special although a little pricey."""""""
3	"""The Thai food here is \alright.\"""" It's not bad but maybe for my taste buds, it was a little on the bland side.  I ordered Shrimp Pad Thai (I thought them skimped on eggs, bean sprouts & green onion) which that dish normally has those ingredients. We also ordered the pork lab (this was good), chicken satay (peanut sauce was bland and thin and cucumber salad did not have much flavor) and yellow curry (thumbs up). I give my overall take out experience an average rating because it was literally \""""alright,\"""" it would satisfy your craving for Thai food."""""""
5	So this place has only been open for a short while. I must say that I was thoroughly impressed. The vallue of this place is off the charts! I mean where else can you get any style eggs, bacon, your choice of toast, fresh fruit, and country potatoes for $5... exactly. The people who work here are super kind and very laid back. Now, do not get me wrong, they do not slack off in the service department... very attentive. I never once had to ask for a refill on my water or coffee. I will definately be back...again and again and again :)
2	I've been craving Indian food since I moved from Boston to Phoenix two months ago, and tonight I finally caved.  I got medium-spice chicken tikka masala from Maharaja Palace.  I will not be returning to this place (unless the other local Indian joints are even more disappointing).  The food was totally adequate, and the medium spice is fairly spicy, which I like, but the dish just lacked the richness I grew to expect in Boston.  That's not the real reason for my 2-star rating, though.  Chicken tikka masala plus rice--which they charge extra for--came to $16.42.  I'm giving the low rating because this is not good value for money.  I love Indian food--I really do--but let's acknowledge for a moment that a lot of Indian food--or at least this dish--is basically slop.  Slop that should be absolutely delicious.  This wasn't absolutely delicious, and it was expensive--and all the more so because of the slop factor.
3	"""Eh this pizza was pretty good I suppose. There was an awful lot of hype and much too long of a wait for us to have been discussing out favorite delivery chains during dinner.\n\nThe hostess got a little rude because our group was \incomplete\"""" (I feel like she really gets me!).\n\nThe server was so charming, friendly and funny that it was extra disappointing to realize he pretty much took the order delivered the food and...well and nothing that was about it. Not terrible service but not great by any means.\n\nHad we waited 20 minutes as apposed to two and a half hours and had the staff een a bit less off, this place could easily hit the 4 star mark. As it is I had to be very optimistic and throw in a lot of benefit of the doubt to go with 3."""""""
5	My wife was at Desert Banner for a small procedure, while waiting I decided to visit this location at Dobson and Southern. As I was walking in 2 or 3 cooks, yes cooks welcomed me into the restaurant. I approached the take out counter and the girl was very helpful. The thing that really got me was how sincere the staff was at taking care of everyone that walked in, the man in the black shirt (manager ?) was helping clear tables, taking food to the guest, talking to tables and he came over offered me a drink while I was waiting, went into the kitchen and checked on my order, brought it out and bagged it up for me. The food was awesome and as at all oreganos, they really take care of the guest. Did I mention the manager sent a cookie with me for my wife after I told him how mad she was going to be that I visited Oreganos without her.\n\nLove this place!!
4	"""I'm one of those crazy people that need to visit multiple stores to complete my grocery shopping. This Sprouts has the best selection of produce for the best price. The organic section isn't bad either. I also like the quality of meat/poultry, so fresh and reasonably priced. \nWhen I walk in I try to remember to go straight for the produce otherwise I'll get sidetracked by the \all natural\"""" lotions, oils and body washes. Then on to the vitamins and supplements, I can spend forever reading labels and trying to find something I can't live without. Inevitably my head starts to spin and I move on but it's always an elucidating part of my visit.  To top it off the staff is really friendly. It's always an enjoyable shopping experience at Sprouts... for my wallet too!"""""""
3	"""2.5 starts for really crappy service!!!\nFor such a nice place, you'd think they'd have better service.  Holy frijoles, it sucked!  I went for the game night that Glenn and Bri planned.  I finally saw a guy walk by in a suit and said (in my not-so-quiet voice) \I'll never come back here again.\""""  He came right to our table with more Yelpers and said \""""Are you guys the Yelpers?\""""  I had to actually raise my hand, like in 3rd grade, the rest of the night to get refills on my drink.\nThe food was good.  Only good.  The crab cakes were AWESOME.  Huge hunks of crab, and only crab, coated with a light crumb and served on a sauce with REAL horseradish.  The fries?  Not so good.  Their only saving grace was that they were coated in Old Bay seasoning.  They were just normal shoestring fries, though.\nI really doubt I would go back just to eat.  \nThe ambience is really nice, though.  I just think that for a hotel restaurant, which in itself is in the HOSPITALITY industry, they'd have better service.  At one time, our server even changed color!  He said he was from Cuba.  I called him Fidel.  He laughed."""""""
4	The map looks a little different then the actual location, essentially it is right off Bell in the corner of the shopping plaza by the mattress place. i know a few regulars and they absolutely love it. i have been there several times myself and the bagels are fresh and made every morning. the staff is very friendly and will run all kinds of customizations for you. the prices are very reasonable and they are a breakfast and lunch place only; and on the weekends there can be a descent size line for the 10 o'clock bagel rush.
4	Had breakfast here with my honey on the way to the airport to go back home to Cali. \n\nThe restaurant was very clean and the decor was contemporary.\n\nWe were immediately seated and given menus and a glass of water. I immediately noticed the menu consisted of a fusion of french and southern foods. \n\nI ordered an egg white omelet, it came with potatoes, and toast. I also had a mimosa. \n\nMy husband ordered the quiche lorraine which came with a salad. He also ordered a bloody mary. \n\nWe also ordered beignets (we couldn't resist) which came with raspberry sauce, nutella, and a vanilla bean sauce. \n\nThe food as GREAT and cheap! The raspberry sauce was good enough to write home and tell mom. \n\nThe beignets was not as good as the ones you get from the famous Cafe du Mond in New Orleans but they were very tasty. \n\nI wish we would have discovered this place sooner.
3	The food is pretty good, BUT\n\n1. it is inconsistent.  One day I'll get lots of cream cheese on my bagel and another day they'll skimp out on it and leave lots of dry parts.  I paid $5 for a pint of matzo ball soup and got one tiny (and very dense) matzo ball--felt a little ripped off. There should be standard portions I think.\n\n2. I think I was over charged my first time there.  My bill came to $10 but according to the menu my bagel was 3.20 and the soup was $4.95.  Is the tax rate 20% now? The amount is so small that I didn't make an issue of it, but I read another review complaining of the same thing so I think it's worth mentioning. \n\nI'll still go back for bagels because they are way better than Einsteins, especially the cream cheese, but I'll be sure to check any to-go orders for skimpy portions before leaving next time, and check my bill carefully before paying.
3	I work within walking distance to Firehouse Subs. I don't frequent it much because it is only okay in my opinion. Today I had the best sandwich I've had from Firehouse yet. I had the steak and cheese (minus cheese cause I'm lactose intolerant), with peppers and onions on wheat. Delicious but I've had a stomach ache since. I guess that's not saying much because I get a stomach ache whenever I eat almost anywhere. The Italian is pretty good too. Slightly expensive. \n\nOh, and if you are getting their cherry limeade from the machine make sure you put sprite in it as well, because I'm pretty sure it's just cherry syrup.
2	I was really eager to try this place because I know a lot of people who have enjoyed eating here.  The service was very slow, though very professional and friendly.  The menu looked so exciting and I finally landed on the lobster and crab tacos, with a side of the mac n' cheese (since I have heard such good things).  The presentation was disappointing and I knew once it came out that I was not impressed.  Nothing tasted bad, the food was just extremely disappointing.  The food was bland, dry, and had  little meat in the tacos.  The mac n' cheese was bland and watery.  I was so happy I only ordered water because my company joining me for lunch ordered iced tea and had only one refill.  I felt like $40 was completely wasted on a very disappointing meal.  \n\nI will not be returning.
3	I like the atmosphere and vibe of this place, it is so cozy and quaint.  The service is attentive and friendly, these 2 reasons are why I give it 3 stars.  The food on the other hand I am not a huge fan of.  It is alright, that is it, nothing I have tried has ever made me ecstatic.  The mac and cheese, at least the one piece I got, was just a chunk from the corner of the pan.  It was dry, it was overcooked, it was not the best. I prefer something creamier and not so dense.  Really good mac and cheese needs to be nurtured into perfection.  The different ingredients added at different times, not mixed together all at once and put into a pan to bake.  I felt like I got the last smidge out of a pan that was sitting under the warmer.  Another appetizer I had was the spinach dip which was ok but the portion was exceedingly small compared to the huge mound of chips.  Let's just make it a bit more even please.  I will continue to go here, but probably just to meet friends for a drink or two.
4	"""There are many things to like and dislike about Charlie's. I've gone before and this last visit was for the Sunday beer bust while visiting Phoenix. \n\nFirst impressions: beautiful day out and the place is so dark!! God, what a little natural lighting would do to this place. Outside it is spacious and well designed deck and volleyball area, not so sure this is a good use of space though (do people really come to a gay bar to play volleyball?). The issue is the horrible, oppressive, smoking everywhere outside. Does it not occur to you that the non-smokers might want to enjoy the patio too?? They let them smoke right by the door and so the smoke and stench makes it way into the actual bar. My eyes were watering! They could easily \accommodate\"""" the smokers by having them assemble only by the bleachers area where there is more open air. (The fact that they even sell cigarettes, shows how dumb the owners are). \n\nThe other issue is the crappy, and I do mean crappy, sound system. All I could hear was the base pounding. Nobody was dancing. (maybe time for a new DJ). Upgrade the damn sound system already. \n\nFinally, take advantage of the beautiful men (some) and keep it a litter warmer inside, so guys will WANT to take their shirts off. I walked around with my coat on the entire time after it got later in the afternoon. These are common sense things, that they've become complacent to it seems. Please listen to the visitors who see your bar with a fresh eye.\n\nGiven the lack of gay bars in Phoenix, I appreciate Charlie's being open and celebrating 28 years!!"""""""
4	This is a busy Auto Zone, and I half expected to have to strangle someone in order to get some help. I have been here thrice in the past month, and all three times the employees were busy, but helpful and efficient! \n\nI changed the battery in two separate cars, and replaced the coil pack in my Jetta. The staff came out to make sure the batteries were actually dead before I purchased new ones. In both battery cases they were. No mystery, just a reading on their handy computer! \n\nAnother time, I couldn't find what I was looking for, and instead of pointing, the nice man walked down the aisle and got it for me.  All the while the store was busy as hell.  They really have their shit together as employees!  I like that, and this is where I go when I need auto parts because of it.\n\nThanks Thomas Road Auto Zone, you rock!
4	This place never ceases to amaze me.  Usually, I go to the one on Camelback near the Biltmore.  I now work in the Scottsdale Airpark, so I go to FLW.  \nI love walking into Trader Joe's.  It feels so peaceful and happy and...nice!  \nI wanted hummus.  Found two kinds that are DE-LISH!  Roasted garlic and the other is spicy hummus.  \nA girl at the office had these cheese puffs and I had to get them!  they are Buccaneer Joe's White Cheddar corn Puffs. YUM!  I also got some dunkers.  They are good for a sweet fix. \nFlowers were cheap and I wish I were home more often to buy some to enjoy.\nMinus one star for my grumpy cashier.  Geesh.  He works at Trader Joe's - be happy about that!\n\nI adore Trader Joe's.  I would grab its hand, hop in the R32 and take it to Vegas!
1	Well... I just returned from the ER. \n\nThe only thing I ate yesterday was the chicken quesadilla which tasted good at the time but wasnt worth the throwing up and food poisoning pain for the last 6 hours. I dont know if it was just a chance incident but  frankly I do not care. I will never go here again even tho i live across the street. \n\nif i were you i would keep on looking, go to taco bell or something, at least you know u can sue a big corporation if you get sick.
3	Finally tried this place because it is so close to home, and for that reason will probably go there again but wasn't overly impressed.  \nThe good is that the service was outstanding.  Very friendly and on top of things without being overbearing.  \nThe pasta with vodka sauce was pretty good although the pasta was a little mushy.  My risotto (mushroom) was pretty bland.  These were some of the smaller entrees as we weren't terribly hungry, and the bigger ones that we saw coming out did look good so I might go back when I'm hungrier.  \nTo sum it up - if you live in the neighborhood, worth stopping in, but probably not worth a drive from anywhere.
3	"""Well first of all the $14 dollar admission fee is ridiculous...but what's more ridiculous is the $14 admission fee plus $3 dollars extra if you want to go in a maze.....\n\nWell since it's my bf's bday and there really isn't much to do in AZ, I decided what the heck and went for the $17 fee...just to kill time before dinner at POSH. So it has 4 levels....the first level was about building houses, and the human body...i admit some of the interactive displays were kinda cool but some where kinda boring. the second level consist of science on electricity, weigh, magnets, and light. The only thing i thought was cool was the nail bed. The third level was where the maze was and also where you learn about clouds, grand canyon and environmental sciences. The maze was a rip off really...don't understand why they charged $3 for the entrance...it was filled with optical illusion posters that I've already seen before online....so yeah really not worth the extra $3 bucks. -_-\\n\nwe didn't get to see the 4th level unfortunately because we needed to leave before our two hour meter runs out...oh yeah parking is like $12 bucks in the garage....so yeah just park on the street if you can. \n\nSo $17 dollars i killed an hour and half at most. This place is really meant for kids....children....under 12...because I even think any kid above 12 would find this place a little boring. I can't believe they even have a membership program...who would want to come here more than once?"""""""
3	I'm a beer nut. I love Rogue, Stone, and any other west coast craft brews. When saw a picture in new times with a half dozen Rogue taps, I knew I had to go. We decided to wait until they had been open a few days and could get the hang of things.\n\nSo, Sunday night we drove all the way up to the north suburbs into some sterile power center with all the usual suburban crap. I was overly delighted to see pictures of downtown Phoenix all over the place. There are probably a couple dozen photoshopped shots around the restaurant. It definitely made me feel like it was at least not 100% a carbon copy chain restaurant, even though it is a chain, but it's probably franchised. \n\nThe wings I would not order again. The quality of them seemed to be fine, and they were baked rather than deep fried, but they were so small that it made me feel a little ripped off. They were about 1/2 the size of the wings from NYPD and about 1/3 the size of Streets of New York's. I then ordered the Rogue Chocolate Stout and the girlfriend ordered a Rogue Juniper Ale, both on draft, along with just about everything else, including Chimay tripple... nice! Pizza was a Kosmik Karma, which was a vegetarian pizza and was tasty enough, but was a completely average pizza. Nothing was crispy, nothing was jumping out at me, but it was edible. I'd had much worse. \n\nThe place is VERY chaotic. It's loud, busy, and has people running around everywhere. And, as you'd imagine on the northside, there are plenty of white trash families running around, lots of 15 year old girls in skate shoes and famous stars and stripes hoodies, and lots of lifted trucks. Be prepared to eat with a lot of douches. Service was excellent, though. I'd return if I were in the area, and while it's nice to have something to fall back on in that situation, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back since really the only draw for me are the beers.
5	Spending the year in Denver is causing me to have Thai Lahna day dreams...even if I was just there two weeks ago for a little Christmas vacation. \n\nI've been going to this magical place for over fifteen years...right Mom? and I never walk away disappointed. Lately, we've been dining in more than taking out and that has been a real treat. The serving staff aren't necessarily there to give you the best service, but to give you the best authentic Thai food you will ever have! They're letting you into their territory and I'm letting you in on our little secret of the best Thai in Arizona! \n\nIf you're a Pahd Thai fan then look no further, this is THE BEST YOU WILL EVER HAVE!!!!! The sauce they use is mouthwatering and is causing me to have a panic attack because it's so good! I admit I get it on the mild side because I'm a major wimp, but even my friends and family have loved it at any spicy level.\n\nOn my 22nd birthday I took my friends in to try this amazing place and all of them have come running back to it!! \n\nWhether its the curry, noodles, rice, or soup that you want, they have it. Perfectly seasoned and waiting to be devoured. \n\nTry everything and anything and I promise you will always be satisfied!
4	This is a belated review....\nWe went for New Year's  dinner two years ago and though it was freezing out side the food was amazing. I can't remember the courses but everything was delightful - very unique and local. I used to work nearby and went to the farm often. With a new job I've lost time and am not in the area as much and pretty much forgot about it. \nIt's defintiely a hidden treasure and I plan on making a reservation soon!
1	What happened to this place?  The first time I went about a year ago, both the food and service were great.\n\nSecond time, last May, I ordered the same dish and it was horrible.  Drowning in sauce.  But, at least the service was decent.\n\nJust went a third time and it will be my last.  Both the food and service were horrible.  Went for lunch, sat inside and it wasn't very busy.  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things, like taking our order to start.  \n\nThen, even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.  In the meantime, I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area, which is open, so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins.\n\nMy food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.  This is a shame, especially because there aren't many places in Phx that have vegan choices, but for the price you pay, I would expect a lot more.
1	This is the most stank trannie bar ever. I went with some friends and it smelled like smelly balls and hooker juice. The karaoke system sucked, rotation was long, there was some crackhead outside smoking talkin bout shankin people and i honestly thought he was gonna shank me. The old bartender that was there which i dont recall but i think he had all of three teeth was rude and the prices werent all that for us to be puttin up with it. Our group sang maybe two songs in the two hours we were there but the worst of the night was when i had to break the seal. The bathroom was covered in diahrea all over the toilets and groung with toilet paper scattered everywhere and when i told the bartender, they left it that way. Can i get a heell nah. Skip this bar
1	"""We've been going here since it opened several years ago and it keeps getting worse. Food is good, not great. Service has never been good here, but it seems to get worse each time we come back. The woman who manages or owns the place never even acknowledges us. She looks at us each time we come in like she has never seen us before. She seems to have no problem bs'ing with the other patrons, but ignores us. Not that we really want to chit chat with her, but a polite \hello, welcome back\"""" would be nice. They have raised the wine prices to the point of most high end restaurants. They have also taken ingredients out of there food. For example the louisiana po'boy used to include\nchicken breast, shrimp, andouille sausage, with a choice of red beans and rice or gumbo. Now it only comes with the chicken, no shrimp or andouille sausage. The andouille is available at extra cost. You no longer have a choice of the red beans & rice or the gumbo, only fries. The only reason we are still going here is that we previously purchased some discount coupons. We have two coupons left to use, and that will be our final dining experience here.Also beware if you are going here for the first time as their online menu is old and not updated."""""""
4	"""This great little find in CenPho is worth the drive, for me, atleast.\n\nI popped in here with my dad last week (thanks to the glowing reviews on Yelp) and tried it out for lunch. \n\nIt was tough to find, as it feels like you're just cruising through purely residential areas when all of the sudden one of the old victorian houses has a humbly posted \Cibo\"""" sign on the corner. \n\nThe decor is fantastic. It feels like you're in an old restaurant in northern California with clever ornamentation. The menu was a little confusing, and apparently there are some limitations on the lunch menu as compared with dinner, but we thought we were ordering pizzas and somehow ended up with sandwiches. This wasn't really a problem though, since these sandwiches were exceptionally tasty and served on pizza bread. \n\nDefinitely a great find and a new item on the list of places to take out of town visitors."""""""
5	Awesome place to stay. \n\nClean. floors look good and bedspreads are white and new looking.\n\nStaff. Housekeeping and front desk are super nice and helpful. \n\nRooms. Beds are super comfortable. Before I leave I am checking the mattress label so I know what to buy for my own home.\n\nLocation: Can't get any closer to hospital. NOthing beats being a minute walk away from the hospital when you have a loved one in there.\n\nFacilities: Pool and hottub are small but nice and clean. Not crowded. Not noisy. Fresh baked cookies at desk and coffee free all day. Great free breakfast in the morning complete with make your own waffles, eggs, meat, fruit, cereals, oatmeal, juices, and bagels, muffins and yogurt. fridge and microwave in room. Good prices.\n\nI stayed at the hilton in phoenix before coming here and this is far superior. \n\nOnly problem... my fridge did not work and food I bought spoiled. We were given a free night for losing ten dollars worth of food.\n\nGreat hotel!!
1	I used my Groupon with Sacred Hogan Navajo Frybread. I did not have a very good experience.  Both my friend and I got chicken frybread sandwich, and the chicken was very dry and tasteless.  They ran out of picante salsa, and we had to beg our neighbors to give a little to give some taste.  Even with that, the taste did not improve that much.  We asked our server for some side beans to hopefully give some flavor, and he returned about 15 minutes later when we almost finished telling us that they ran out.\n\nI was taking my buddy out for his b-day, and this was the not the b-day experience I was hoping to give.
3	I really like the feel of this library, it's very bright and open.  It is much smaller then I'm used to since I usually go to Burton Barr but the books they actually carried that I wanted were checked in which is why we stopped in.  I'll stick to the larger location but I'd be happy to pick things up here when I see they've got it online.  \n\nLots of tables for laptops, as well as desktop computer stations. Early Saturday morning wasn't too busy but had a nice buzz about it.  Might be a nice place to study or work if you need some quiet and live in the area.
2	I was not overly excited to eat here because this is just another chain with 'eh' food.  This was my second trip to this place, but will probably be my last because there are just too many good restaurants in the area to waste time eating at run-of-the-mill places like Elephant Bar.\n\nI agree with most of the other reviews that there really is no common theme for the food.  You would think that it is going to be 'jungle' or 'island' themed, but I was at a loss as to what they were actually going for.  The decor is unique and is jungle themed, but the menu was random.  From potato skins and calamari to ribs and coconut fried shrimp; this was more of a more expensive Applebee's than anything else.\n\nI also agree with most of the other reviews on here about the food.  The portions and prices are almost reasonable, but the quality just isn't there.  I ordered the burger and it was clearly from a package and frozen just a few hours before.  The sweet potato fries were ok at best and really nothing special.  Neither were the calamari, nachos, ribs, or tri-tip I tasted.  I agree that all the food may very well have been from Costco.\n\nI have nothing bad to say about the service.  Our waiters were very friendly, helpful and quick and there were no major issues with our party of 9.
2	Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits):\n7 Food\n7 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n6 Value\n\nThe food is hit or miss, some mini-burgers are great, some are meh; and the sweet potato fries don't even come close to places like Delux.  The atmosphere is on the verge of trying too hard to look modern-chic, but does barely manage to stay legit and come across as cool - barely.\nThe service (when I've been there - realizing that this is the most variable element of a place) wasn't timed well and didn't get stuff right.  I realize that it can easily be the kitchen's fault instead of the server's, but even in that case it's still the server's place to check the food before bringing it out - especially considering that it wasn't a busy night.
2	"""I remember trying Rosita's a long time ago and being pretty disappointed after a number of my friends had hyped it up pretty heavily...so today, as my co-worker and I debated over which Mexican place to try, I decided to give Rosita's another opportunity to win me over. For starters, the chips and salsa were pretty average. The chips were a little thicker than I prefer, and the salsa (at least in my opinion) tasted like a thin tomato base mixed with water. Very little spice, and not much taste at all. I ordered a shredded beef burro and a chicken taco combo plate because it was one of the best deals on the menu at $7.50, and I enjoyed the shredded beef...perhaps a bit dry, but it still had a decent flavor to it. The chicken, however, gave me flashbacks to my bad experience at Manuel's...although not quite as awful, it was very bland and lacked any real redeeming qualities. I still don't get how a place can f-up chicken! Jeeez. The spanish rice I had on the side was pretty standard, but all in all this was another pretty \bleh\"""" dining experience. My dining companion just sent me an email to inform me that his bean burrito was already trying to make a comeback, I'm just glad I went double rice verus rice and beans. I give it two stars because we had a good waitress who was fairly attentive and because the shredded beef was passable."""""""
4	I've been here a couple times and I always enjoy the different ceviches and appetizers we order- never tried one that I didn't like. Also their bread rolls and butter are really good. A different bread taste than most are used to but I like that it's unique. Just as a heads up, their drinks are very small for the price you pay for each. Their main entrees are delicious, I love their sea bass. My boyfriend always get this steak/crab combo that I've tried and it's reeeeally good. I did try the lamb once but I was not a fan. Service is excellent, knowledgable, and attentive.
5	The best fry bread in town.  While I havent had tons of fry bread I have had my fair share and The Fry Bread House was the winner by leaps and bounds.  They make the bread fresh everyday and top it with very delicious green and red chili and beans.  The dessert fry bread comes with butter and melted chocolate that drips off your bread.  I recommend sharing with someone if you have anything to do for the rest of the day.  Also the parking can be tight at peak hours as the spots are limited.
4	"""I'm with Yvonne R. - this was a wonderfully organized event.  Most Ironman races are supposed to be, but theory & execution are two very different things.  The entire weekend went off pretty flawlessly & I felt welcomed and taken care of no matter where I went.\n\nOne thing I wasn't crazy about was the athlete dinner on Friday night.  The venue was nice to look at, but it was quite chilly outside & we couldn't sit through all of it.  The food wasn't so great, but it was still neat to be amongst all the other athetes.  Maybe next time we can have some outdoor heaters or something?  Just a thought.\n\nBefore the sun came up on race morning, we were being herded into the 60 degree water & up to the starting line.  Thank goodness for wetsuits!  After the pros took off, the directors & the Mayor of Tempe gave us some words of encouragement, pumped us up with some music, & fired the cannon.  Off we went into a mass of bodies and dark water.  I enjoyed the swim, save for the last 300 meters or so when someone decided to unzip my wetsuit.  Thanks, dude.  At least it was easy to get off once I climbed those stairs out of the lake!\n\nLucky us, the weather decided to be wonky this year, complete with crazy winds & some rain action.  Yay for us.  The only place this was extremely noticeable was on the bike, which was a 3-loop course meaning we hit headwinds every single time.  I swear, the last 8 miles took forever thansk to the 20-30 mph gusts.  Ugh!  The volunteers were great at handups & never lost their energy while cheering us on.  One tiny complaint: please put a 2nd (or 3rd or 4th) bathroom at the special needs stop.  Definitely a small holdup there due to lack of facilities.  I like cycling, but boy was I glad when the volunteers snagged my bike from me!  Nor did I miss it much as I headed out for the final leg of the race.\n\nThe run was also a 3-loop course, but that just meant I was better able to get my bearings.  It was fairly flat, though repeating one large hill 3 times got to be a little daunting.  All of the aid stations were well stocked & had enthusiastic volunteers.  You'd think the whole \You're doing great!\"""" thing would get old, but as the sun goes down & it gets cold, you're thankful for any encouragement you can get.  Again agreeing with Yvonne R. - Chuck Norris never did an Ironman!  Thank you, hilarious spectators!\n\nI don't think I can say enough about the fantastic spectators & volunteers.  Since the course was multi-looped, you could always count on someone being nearby to cheer you on.  The finish line was full of energy & lit up brightly for the entire city to see &, as soon as you're done, a volunteer is there to take care of you.  I also got to shake Chrissie Wellington's hand after I crossed the line.  How freakin' cool is that?!  Overall, it was an amazing race for my first Ironman & I had a blast."""""""
4	I don't think I would have made it through some of my long days in the dance department at ASU without a lunch from Sacks. I have had sandwiches and salads alike at this fine establishment, hardly any of which have left me unsatisfied. The free cookies are yummy and a nice pick me up on a hard day. Plus definitely dig the vegetarian options, mostly because its more than just some cheese and veggies on bread.  Lastly, I might add that amidst the chaos of the lunch hour, they would never falter in their efficiency to make the perfect sandwich. My one complaint was that I wished it was open in the evenings. Evening classes or rehearsals may have gone a little better with some  pre-dance deliciousness.
5	Rip's has become our favorite neighborhood bar for a few reasons.  The first and most important being Karaoke.  There's a reason it was voted best in the valley (New Times '11).  Karaoke is usually pretty terrible, but not at Rip's - the host, Jen, is a great host and singer.  And the other singers vary in skill, but the crowd is always supportive.  Drinks are usually pretty cheap, and all the bartenders are great - the kind that like to know your name.  Obscura is not a typical night for Rip's, but is an AWESOME dance night.  Stop by Rip's any day for a good time.
4	It's a lazy Sunday afternoon, and I'm looking through my Groupons, figuring out where I'm going for an early dinner today.  Now I live in West Mesa, and don't want to drive very far, but I have promised myself that I'm going to start using my Groupons as they expire, and this one was the next.  It's only about 12 miles, so Megan and I say, what the heck, let's go.  \n\nThe minute you walk in you feel welcome at this place.  Peanuts on the floor, lots of TVs, lots of regulars, comfortable booths, and they greet you as soon as you walk in the door.  Our server was Sabrina (I think) and she was great start to finish.  From the moment we walked in the door through  extra stuff requested and refills too.  Always there, but not in your face.  \n\nI had a Turkey Dip Sandwich with the steak fries and a salad.  Megan had the French Dip Sandwich with curly fries and a salad, with two large diet Pepsi (wishing for Coke).  Bread was ok, turkey tasted great.  Steak fries were good.  Didn't really care for the turkey au jus that was served with the turkey, so didn't use that much.  Megan's French Dip sandwich was great all the way down to the au jus.   She really liked the curly fries,  The only complaint I had on this place was the ranch dressing was not cold...maybe it was just made, I'm not sure?  But I like cold dressing on my salad.  \n\nFood was good, but I have to tell you what would bring me back was the atmosphere.  Loved this place, and will drive to it again!
3	I usually hit this place with a friend of mine who is a wing fanatic.  I hear good things about the wings, but I usually order something else.  \n\nThe dining room can get pretty packed and loud, but I've never had to wait more than five minutes.  \n\nSome of the bench seats in the dining room area are a bit broken down and or/crooked, which can make yer back or buttocks hurt after sitting for a while.  \n\nNo drink deals worthy of mention that I am aware of, but I usually stick to draft beer.  All in all a pretty decent joint.
1	Don't bother with this place.  I had never been here, my husband and I decided to pick up some food to take home.  We ordered a shrimp tempura appetizer, an assorted tempura appetizer, a lobster appetizer, and yakisoba.  When we got home the order was totally wrong. Instead of lobster we were given mussels (which were gross), instead of assorted tempura and shrimp tempura we only got assorted tempura with 2... that's right only 2 shrimp in the whole mix.  The yakisoba was the only part of the order they got right and it was not that great, pretty bland.  I love Japanese food and I was really excited to find a place near by and while we were waiting for our order we were excitedly planning to come back and have their sushi, but after this complete mix up and poor quality food there is no way I would trust them with anything raw.  Never going back, such a complete disappointment.
3	Have not stayed there but had dinner at the restaurant on a Sunday night. Food was good, price was OK but made it great was the 1/2 price promotion on a bottle of wine that they were running on Sunday nights. The presentation of the food is really creative and it makes up for the small portions. They give you some cotton candy after your meal. A nice touch. It is a great place to go if you are going to a play at the Herberger or another downtown event. Went back for lunch it was good but expensive for what you got. Will only go back at lunch when someone else is picking up the tab :-). As far as the hotel itself the outside looks like it was modeled after a Moscow public housing development but the inside is incredible. If you keep your eyes closed until you get inside the building you will be pleased.
5	This Gamestop is located near the Harkins Theaters in the Tempe Marketplace. It is well staffed with generally nice and knowledgeable employees. They usually hold midnight launches for popular games which run relatively smoothly. The store manager is frequently working and you can tell he is a gamer himself; the type of guy that can relate to both young and old gamers. Like all Gamestops, at this location you can pre-order games, buy/sell/trade games, and buy/sell/trade consoles and accessories. \n\nIf you head over there and can't find a nearby parking spot, you may notice four open CPK curbside takeout spots right outside the Gamestop. Whatever you do, do NOT conveniently park in the vacant CPK curbside spot. It's just wayyyyy too convenient.  It would be bad to park there since you aren't going to CPK. Despite the fact that they have four spots that are almost always open...right next to Gamestop...don't even think about taking that spot for the 5 minutes you need to run in and out of the store. I, of course, would NEVER do this, so you didn't hear about the idea from me.
4	Sincerely impressed with this little strip mall Italian joint. Service was excellent. Perfectly times meal with great suggestions from the staff. The spicy shrimp app with polenta was as advertised, very spicy and outstanding. I've had the seafood pasta special, the lasagna and the meatballs. All were above average. They have a nice little wine list and their by the glass selections are stored and served at the proper temp. Menu prices are very resonable. I plan on being here a lot. So should you.
1	"""Fail!\n\nAfter having an okay dinner on a Sunday night, we ordered dessert here. There was an all new wait staff and they kept changing the music from Indian to Korean. \n\nMy husband ordered the dessert called Ras Malai. He started to eat it and then it kept tasting worse and worse to him. I tried it and I threw up in my napkin. It was awful! \n\nWhen I called the waiter over to tell him that the Ras Malai had gone bad he said that \I thought that it looked a little iffy, but brought it out anyway.\"""" WTF!!!!! Even our kid had taken a bite when we first got it. Husband spent the night in the bathroom to say the least. \n\nWhat a bloody awful experience here. I am really questioning the freshness of ALL foods here now. Yuck!"""""""
4	Cool spot to stop for a drink if you're in the neighborhood.\n\nThis is definitely a place for cocktails, as opposed to other libations.  Signature cocktails are the way to go -- I had a cucumber-mint martini, which was very good. \n\nThe ambiance is modern and slightly Euro, and also very urban.  The absence of windows, dim lighting and backdoor entrance make SideBar feel exclusive.  There is no outdoor space, so this place might be a great option for hiding out on a hot summer night.
5	"""Words cannot describe how much I love Windsor. It's in my favorite part of town, has an ice cream shop attached and has a wall full of cassette tapes that include gems like \Amy's Workout Jamz\"""". How can you NOT love it? The atmosphere is an absolute home run. I just can't wait for it to cool down so I can experience the expansive patio. \n\nThe staff are friendly, fun and helpful, the beer is good, and the food is delicious. On my last visit I had the Banh Mi Sandwich, which was perfect. The sides are interesting and delicious, and items like the mac & cheese and the broccolini should not be missed. \n\nWindsor is one of those places I can't stop talking about, and with good reason. It's the perfect mix of location, good food and fun, quirky atmosphere that really makes it a local gem. Go. Now!"""""""
3	"""I've heard about this place being \the best\"""" burger joint so i had to check it our for myself. My boyfriend and i went on a saturday afternoon and to my surprise most of the seats were taken, people were coming and going so my first thought was they must be good since they were so busy. Severs were really nice and prompt.\n\nwe both ordered their 1/3 lb arizona smashburger which has: habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipolte mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun, we also had an order of their smash fries.\n\nfirst thought, the presentation of the burgers and fries looked great, after putting mustard and ketchup on it and TRIED to pick up the burger everything almost feel out. It was messy and greasy totally ruined the experience of enjoying the burger. It tasted like any other burger, nothing really special about it. Their fries however were amazing. \n\non a scale of 1-10 i would give this place a 6 just for the food presentation. my boyfriend said he wouldn't go back but i'll give it another try one day."""""""
4	I saw their ad in the College Times and decided to check it out. Had a coupon for free earrings (little stud dice ones) and I lost it; they still gave them to me anyways since they knew I was legit :) Stormy the co-owner is really nice. Lots of cool bargains to choose from; some really nice stuff I had to pass up since I am on a budget :) I did in-store trading too and got around $24 worth of store credit, which I used all at once. Overall a fun hunt. It's also a small little place so not too hard to get lost. :)
5	"""I've been a regular customer at the EBa! Cafe for years.  I take everyone I know here to try it!\n\nBest Product:\nTheir drinks, by far.  My favorites are their flavored iced teas with boba.  The coffee drinks are good, but with all the good coffee shops in Tempe, I'd never pass up an opportunity to get a boba tea here.\n\nWhat is BOBA?\nIf you've never had boba, then here's what you're missing-- you basically get a large scoop of oversized tapioca balls stirred into your drink.  They settle to the bottom, where it looks like you've got brown bubbles sitting at the floor of your cup.  As you slurp through your oversized straw, they come up with the iced tea, drumming at the roof of your mouth so you have to stop and chew every now and then.  They're the consistency of little drowned gummi bears, and can seem VERY weird at first, but if you're open-minded enough to try it, you might get hooked.  (I was determined not to like them, at first.  I got to the point where I went back twice a day to get more.)  They're completely vegan and don't taste much like anything on their own.  After a few minutes, though, they start to absorb the flavor in the iced tea around them.  So, it's like getting a drink and a snack in one.  Be careful not to take them home and refrigerate them overnight, though... they tend to dry out in the middle.\n\nHeads up to new boba drinkers:\nThe cup will come to you with a sealed plastic top (to prevent spillage).  Don't try to peel it off... it's really stuck on there.  Just use your straw to punch a hole in the top of it.  That's what they're made for.  Be careful picking it up after that, though... the cups are sometimes thin enough to squeeze when you grab them, forcing the tea up through the new straw hole and all over you.  Take a few slurps before trying to move it around.\n\nFlavors and Mixers:\nAll iced teas start with either a green tea or a black tea base.  After that, you choose your flavors to add.  My favorites are the peach, chai spice, ginger spice, pumpkin spice (seasonal), wintermelon, almond, chocolate, and sometimes banana milk.  The good thing is that the menu suggestions are just recommendations... you can custom-mix your flavors however you want them.  For the drinks that require milk, they use either soy or almond milk (I don't remember which), so even non-dairy folks can enjoy the whole range of flavors.  You can also substitute honey for the sweet syrup mixer, or even just opt out of the sweeteners altogether.  They'll prepare it however you like it.\n\nOther menu options:\n* In the middle of a Phoenix summer, their ice crushes and snow bubbles are amazing.  They basically take their boba teas and turn them into boba icees, with the same range of flavors available.  The ice crushes are without ice cream; the snow bubbles are with ice cream.\n* Their hot teas (not used with boba) are loose-leaf scoops in very cool little decanters, but they only have a few different kinds of tea to choose from.\n* Coffees and coffee drinks are very good.\n* Gelato is tasty.\n* The shaved ices are the same as I remember them from childhood, but I didn't like the red beans added to it.  They got too mushy and flavorless compared to the icy goodness around it.\n* The brick toasts are wonderful, and the other food usually comes in small portions, so they're good for a snack.\n* I don't think they mind if you bring in food from other establishments, as long as you patronize their business and clean up after yourself.\n\nService:\nSuzi, the owner, is amazing.  She's in there all the time and is extremely friendly and helpful.  The other employees she hires all stay around for a while, which means that they enjoy working there.  They all know what they're doing and will re-make your order if they screw it up.  Not that they ever have!  They're wonderful!\n\nDecor:\nTheir new-ish location on Broadway doesn't have the same mom-and-pop homemade feel that their old location on Forest did, but it's clean and cute, anyway.  There is seating available at tables, at the counter, or on couches in the front lounge area.  There is a TV in there that is sometimes on, so it can either be a good place to study or way too distracting, depending on your timing.  They'll turn the TV off if you ask.  Wireless is free for customers, but not for leeches.\n\nSpecials and discounts:\n* There is a box of \buy-10-get-1-free\"""" cards by the cash register.  If you get hooked, you'd be amazed at how quickly those go by.\n* Sometimes, there are coupons on the rack inside the Sub Factory, which is in the same shopping center, a few doors down.\n* There are also seasonal coupons online at: http://www.ebacafe.com/\n\nWhat I would change:\n* I'd love to see a decaf iced tea available for mixing.\n* I'd love to have more comfy lounge space and fewer fluorescent lights (the only reason they keep them on is to follow safety codes until they get new lighting installed)."""""""
4	Grimaldi's Pizzeria is my new favorite place to get pizza.  I usually go with my family and here's what we order.  We share the Mediterranean Salad.  It is big enough to serve four people with a little extra for who is hungry.  That would be me.  Romaine lettuce, olives, feta cheese onions etc.  The dressing is very light and refreshing.  For pizza, we order two personal sized pizzas and that feeds four people with a little extra for who is really hungry.  That would be me AGAIN.  This pizza goes down easy.  It's great tasting pizza with delicious sauce, fresh toppings, and thin crusts that do not leave you bloated with dough.\n\nThe wait staff remembers my family and we are greeted when we enter and throughout the course of our dinner.  A past waiter will always drop by to say hello.  The wait staff are very attentive and are true professionals.\n\nThis Grimaldi's location is in the new Park West shopping center.  Check it out.  This location gets packed on the weekends and week nights draw a respectable crowd.  Grimaldi's is one of the reasons.
4	I'd say what distinguished this taco shop from others that have a comparable menu are the little touches. \n\nThey have a little sauce bar with about 3 or 4 types of sauces (my fav is the tomatillo sauce, so tasty!) with little to go containers AND lots of lime slices. People just don't seem to get the importance a fresh squeezed lemon or lime on a taco, BUT THIS PLACE GETS IT :) YAY! \n\nThe flautas come with guacamole AND fresh Mexican cheese sprinkled on top, not mozzarella. \n\nPrices are very reasonable. I ordered 2 small carne asada tacos, 1 order of flautas & 2 large horchatas (rice drink) & it came out under $10. \n\nThe location is small, but it's nice, casual & clean. They have a TV that was on a sports channel & guessing by the big Cardinal plaque in the middle of the room, they are probably cardinal fans :)
4	"""Why eat here when there's a Cheesecake Factory a few steps away? That's exactly why. Step out of your shell, my little Banana-Republic-Crate-and-Barrel shopper. There's a whole new world of individuality out there.\n\nEven though this joint is part of Fox Restaurant Concepts mega-conglomerate, it is a unique place to try. I've been a few times on visits to Scottsdale and each time I leave with a smile on my face. Good \California style cuisine\"""" according to their signage that pleases this Californian.\n\nMahi tacos: yum! Trout: Delish! Their servers: So this is where the male models work when they aren't in a photo shoot."""""""
1	"""I would never recommend this complex to anyone. As the previous yelper pointed put the cars here get vandalized A LOT! Not only that but management changes every six months and each one wants to clean up the complex differently. We had cute little curtains on our patio and they were fine for 4 months until it randomly rained and made them look weird. We had not had time to clean them yet and then were given a warning to take them down due to \community violation\"""". When asked about it they said we could not use our beige curtains because the color was not approved (it was the exact same color as the outside buildings). I was pissed because two apartments down some tenant has a rainbow/flea market blanket hanging in lieu of cute curtains. \n\nThe place is never clean and arizonas swat and most wanted teams have been here more than I can count. Management does not give a crap about you and are willing to show it. It is not worth the 100 dollars less to live here. You will become frustrated and annoyed and hate life. The only person worth anything here is Ozzy the maintenance guy. He is pretty freaking awesome though sometimes forgetful."""""""
4	"""This is a solid 4 star place.  It's a tiny little place in a strip mall, but it is very clean and nice on the inside.  Service is friendly.  The street tacos are great.  A little pricier than what I was expecting ($2.50 each) but they are also a little bigger than your average street taco.  This is definitely a good place for a slightly more upscale \authentic\"""" Mexican place.  It looks like they also have ice cream, but I didn't try any of that."""""""
4	"""mmm, this is chain mexican food that I will eat when I am sober...  That is saying enough if you ask me!\n\nok ok ok, Senor Taco is muy delicioso.  It is real similar to say a Filiberto's but super clean and efficient.  Similar salsa bar setup with the weird jalapeno and carrot mixture that when you ask what it is called they tell you, \Jalapenos and Carrots?\""""\n\nCarne Asada is the bomb and I enjoy their California burrito.  Think all the unhealthy things you can put in a burrito... Sour cream, guacamole, potatoes, beans... yum.  \n\nBiggest downfall is the measly six chips they give you with your meal.  I am sure you could probably get some more if you wanted them though since they are always super nice.\n\nThe salsa are aight.\n\nOh an the 10% student discount they give me when I wear my nerdy name badge... ohhh yeah.\n\nGo there and enjoy some chain mexican food.\n\nYou know you want to!"""""""
5	We were there for the official first night, last night. I had the bone in fillet,which was exceptional,and my husband ordered the bone in veal chop. Maryland crab cake and meatballs were our appetizers.  Everything was first class, hot, delicious, perfect! Our server, Elizabeth was a delight,on the ball and well informed by the kitchen. The lavish surroundings complete the picture.  Staff were friendly, and knowledgable. Great bar area. Food cannot be too expensive, when it is that good, but be prepared to pay for the finest grade of aged meat, and fresh fresh seafood.\n\nIf I have one small criticism, it would be that the tables are too closely grouped, making it difficult for the less experienced servers (water bearers) to navigate without bumping into the diners on chairs in their path. Seems to be many different levels, making it a visually appealing restaurant, but perhaps a bit of an obstacle course.
4	"""My friend and I wanted dinner, I was game for whatever, he wanted a nice restaurant. He mentioned this place and got us reservations. We were seated quickly, really no need for reservations when we went anyway. \n\nWe ordered the bruschetta for appetizer. It was pretty awesome, I wish more for of that at least. I ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables. I was surprised at the portion of the salmon was pretty decent. It was well seasoned and flaked perfectly. The vegetables were quite seasoned i must say, I focused on my salmon more so. Overall I enjoyed my entr\u00e9e.\nAs for my friend, he ordered the Penne alla Norma. First bite, he stops mid-bite and  says \OMG, this is good!\"""" I had to laugh. I agreed, it was pretty tasty. \nDessert was tiramasu, which was pretty nice as well. Although I wished the marscapone cheese was distributed throughout rather than be the first thing one digs into. I was had to shovel out the yummy lady fingers.\n\nwe debated at the end of dinner. I said it was pretty good, but not awesome. Not that I would go running back for more. I would definitely try again, but you won't see me running. The other menu items still look delectably pleasing."""""""
5	I have been stalking St. Francis for months. \n\nLet me explain, I drive by every day on the way home from work, and I can't help taking my eyes off the road to check out this ultra-cool restaurant. I began harassing Sean M. to accompany me to taste the menu so that I could stop creeping and start enjoying the food. My persistence paid off, as it usually does, and we made St. Francis our top choice for Sunday brunch this weekend.\n\nThe wait was a little long but the day was beautiful and I wasn't raging around like a hungry monster so I didn't mind. We were seated after about 30 minutes, but you can make reservations to avoid waiting if you prefer.\n\nWe started brunch by splitting a cinnamon roll. It was moist and covered in caramel sauce which was a nice touch to the iced variety that I am used to. It was huge and only cost $5.00. Totally worth it. \n\nUp next was the salmon eggs benedict. This is one of the best versions of this dish I have ever had. The flavors just work. The english muffin is sourdough with some kind of garlic-y spread underneath salmon, perfectly poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. Amazing!\n\nWe did not sample the drink menu on this trip. I am of the opinion mimosas and bloody mary's should be between $3-$5 on Sundays (it is the day of rest, after all), so I couldn't do the $9 that the menu was asking for.\n\nOverall, a wonderful experience! I can't wait to check out the menu for my other favorite meal, happy hour!
2	I don't know how people can eat here. The food is all grease and fat. The grease in which they deep fry everything is 'off' I think - like they haven't changed it out since the 1980s... everything tastes the same and not in a good way. In fact, everything about this place is like a blast from the past - it's like walking into a museum featuring restaurant cliches from 25 years ago.\n\nI felt dirty and greasy just walking into the joint. The entire place is covered in a layer of film that's neither sticky nor slimy, but truly disturbing. The smells emanating from this place both inside and out are all pretty offensive too. \n\nThe quality of the ingredients used is all very low. I wouldn't ever recommend coming here to eat. We sampled quite a few different items and they were all vile and made me both regret their consumption and consider regurgitation. The sliders were a joke - how do you make greasy bread? Fries are made more of oil than potato. Pizza puffs are basically a twist on a mozzarella stick only wetter and less healthy (however healthy deep fried cheese could be).  \n\nThere was one saving grace though - the salads seem to be decent. I won't be returning though.
3	Cold Stone is a locally based Scottsdale company that has created one of the great ice cream experiences!\n\nWhere ice cream is concerned, we are no longer limited to just Baskin & Robbins, Carvel's and Friendly's as our only choices, now we have Cold Stone, Ben & Jerry's, Ghirardelli's, the list goes on!\n\nOur family has visited many of the west coast stores in several different states over the years and has always found their ice cream to be superb.  What makes Cold Stone unique is the making of your ice cream right in front of you.  Want fresh fruit?  They put it on their cold stone (marble?) along with the ice cream and the mix it with two large spoons.  You want chocolate chips, candy, etc -- same thing.  It's great!\n\nGo!  Enjoy!
1	It's Sunday, right?\n\nDo I have your attention?  It's Sunday, and Barry's Capezio is closed, right?  You need dance supplies for yours or your daughter's dancing class tomorrow and the dance store that you always go to is closed.   You're looking for an alternative and you found this place.  Please don't be tempted.\n\nWhen we went, service seemed friendly, but the consequences for our choice came later.  Our daughter was about ready to begin classes for pointe, and we described to them our situation.  We, on their advice, walked out with demi-pointe shoes--this was the WRONG ADVICE!  No fitting (other than to try them on), no advice as to care, just hand us the shoes and ring us up.  Nothing else.  To see the pain on my daughter's face after that first class was agonizing, as were the huge blisters all over her feet.\n\nWait.  Please wait until Monday.
1	"""WOW!  Crap-O!  We have gone to other TGI Fridays in the past and had a much better experience.  Stopped in here on our way back from a weekend trip.  Tried to go to a neighboring restaurant, but did not want to wait 45 minutes.  Low and behold we were able to get right in at TGIF!  I guess that should have been our first red flag!!  We were seated right away and our server took drink orders and apps order.  We ordered the Green Bean Fries - these were pretty good, but not as good as the ones at PF Changs.  I ordered the Dragon Fire Salmon, which comes with rice pilaf and broccoli.  My wife ordered the TGIF Shrimp, which comes with fries and all you can eat shrimp.  When our meals arrived, my plate looked like a garbage pile!  You know, like when you watch a cooking show and they keep throwing the scraps onto a pile somewhere on the side...Well, that was my plate!  A messy pile up of rice, broccoli, and salmon!  What a mess.  I had to deconstruct the pile of garbage before I could begin eating.  When the waitress asked how it was, and I told her the truth, she seemed to not really care at all.  Then the manager was making the butt-kissing rounds and asked how things were.  I repeated my minor complaint to her, and she just sort of shrugged and said \thanks\"""" while she walked away.  Messy presentation aside, the salmon was pretty good.  The rest was ok.  My wife's meal was nothing special and she practically had to beg for the refill of shrimp.  Worst part, though, was the waitress.  Her name was Stephanie.  VERY inattentive to customers.  Took eons for her to notice we needed drink refills. Took forever to get the bill, as well.  Next booth over was luckier - they had a server named Jessica and she was super attentive and made me feel jealous that I was not seated in her section!  Overall we will NEVER eat here again!  No way, no how!"""""""
5	I kind of fell in love with The Living Room last night.  First, let's start with the atmosphere.  The decor is warm, cozy, and resplendent.  I literally feel like I am in someone's house (and by someone, I mean someone richer than me or my friends), but with waiter service.  Our server, Ryan, was attentive, friendly and eager to make our visit great.  \n\nI sampled two dishes: the fries and the artichoke dip.  Both were fantastic and if they can do the standard fare well, I am excited to try some of their sliders, salads or bruschetta.  My wine was the cheap cab and for the cheap cab it was pretty nice.\n\nThey have all wine glasses for $6 before 6pm, which is something I will be checking out soon.\n\nCentral Phoenix, please patron this place, so that it remains on the landscape...but don't get too crazy, I'd like a permanent seat in this Living Room.
2	"""Was here for NYE and my birthday celebration, bf explained it was my bday upon making reservation.  It was a little more casual than expected but that was fine.  Server Laura, with long blonde hair and big silver circle earrings took her time getting us started.  We ordered a bottle of champagne on the menu and she said I don't know if we have that.  Then she proceeded to flip through our menu on the table to see what they had, clearly unfamiliar with their offerings.  Hmm. NYE you would think you would know what bubbly you have..just sayin'.....She then brought a tiny bottle of sparkling sake and my bf politely asked, \Um, is that champagne?\""""  She looked at it then realizing her mistake, rushed off to get what we ordered and said it was my mistake and the bar's.\n\nWe started with a tuna and poke appetizer which was good, it had truffle oil and served on tortilla chips which was a nice crunchy contrast.  The sauce was really sweet and almost too much as you could barely taste the truffle oil even though you could smell it.  Next the tuna in the spicy tuna roll was brown(?) and not spicy, must have been with a mild soy sauce, and accompanied by only cucumber inside.  This was my least favorite.  The rainbow roll was good and what we expected, albacore sashimi was good but not the best I have had.  Sunshine roll had tuna with a mango sauce that was a refreshing fruit sauce to the palate since most of our rolls were sweet, salty, and or creamy/rich.  The baked scallop roll was okay, too much mayo in the overcooked scallops and was drenched in eel sauce.  The creamy baked lobster roll was the best, with lobster tempura on top of the roll with eel sauce.  Lobster was cooked just right.  \n\nI really wanted a lava cake for my bday but she said they were out which was disappointingly surprising since it was early, like 9:30 ish.  So we said we didn't need anything else (code for \""""you can bring the check\"""")  but still waited for the bill. No luck so I put my coat on as a hint. Still nothing so we started looking around as a sign and even had bf put his bright red debit on the table for her to see...still waiting.  Finally had bf take his card to her.  Sub par service considering the restaurant was not even full and she clearly wasn't busy.  Food was good but not memorable.  Service below average and unlikely to return.  She never even wished me happy birthday."""""""
2	"""I went to Sprouts yesterday because I needed some gluten free flours and I knew I could get them at Sprouts (note: I bought some of the gluten free flours at Fry's for less than they were selling for at Sprouts!). \n\nI'm going to change my rating and up them a star for having a good selection of gluten free baking products, and because this was the first time that I was actually in & out... not a lot of people in the store and they had a lot of lanes open.\n\nMy checker this time was actually pleasant, quick, and efficient. I appreciated that. More experiences like this and maybe I'll up them another star to being \A-OK\"""".\n\nFor now, based on a plethora of experiences, I'm still saying that I've definitely experienced better."""""""
4	Kona has an amazing happy hour.  Its so amazing that you wont be able to get a seat, unless you are lucky.  We tried going at around 4:30 pm on a Friday, and it took about 30 minutes to get a bar table, however we had to use our charming wives to get us the seat.  \n\nThe location in Gilbert is pretty small, the happy hour is only valid on the porch.  I have only been to this Kona once, and that was for happy hour.  So I cannot comment on the majority of there food.  We ordered some spicy tuna rolls and they were pretty good.  \n\nOverall, if you get out of work early go here to get some amazingly cheap drinks.
5	I love this museum.  So much so, that I became a member.  They have a great variety of work, the dosiers are very knowledgeable, and they constantly put on amazing exhibits.  Of course the Phoenix Art Museum pales in comparison to Chicago or New York, but very few museum can exceed those two cities anyway.  If you are looking for something to do and feel like learning something or looking at something beautiful, you should check this place out. It is worth it.
3	"""I've been here a few times.  A couple times when they first opened and just the other day.  Was looking for a good burger.  I had their summer ale.  Light and refreshing but had more flavor than the Kolsch they offered.  Happy hour so $3.25 for a pint. Mmmm.... also ordered the bavarian pretzels... around $6.00.  Was hoping to have some homemade style pretzels, but alas, they did the big no-no and served SUPER PRETZEL, sigh.  Why Four Peaks, why?  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE superpretzels, but just expected more from a place that handcrafts their own beer.  With that being said, the pretzels were hot and yummy and served with a side with possibly \beaver brand\"""" mustard...YUM.  The mustard was the best part.  If I went back, I definitely wouldn't be opposed to ordering them again.    My hubby got the cheeseburger.  Their bun looks partially like a wheat bun--- not opposed at all as it was light and had a nice glossy eggwash to the top.  Not your standard aunt hatties sesame style bun (good for you 4 peaks).  Service was good for a Sunday afternoon.  Got to try several samples and they brought them quick.  The overall experience was good."""""""
5	"""whenever people at work tell me they live in suprise, gilbert, goodyear, etc i look at them with a confused look, the same way i'd look at someone who told me they lived in the midwest. i've never been there, and probably never will unless i need to. and with restaurants like FEZ right on central, why should i ever leave DTPX?\n\nthe food at FEZ is, as my wifepiece says, \yumvers\"""". their burger with hummus, manchego cheese, and pesto sounds awful but is probably the best burger i've ever had. make sure you order a thing of the sweet potato fries w/cinnamon, they're a perfect app.\n\nif you go on tuesday you can get $5 vodka martini's, i ordered a plain one (no pomegranite appletini with a chocolate swirl for me, thanks) and got a surrious buzz by the time i finished it. ordering a 2nd one would be a very cheap way to get drunk, ten dollars usually buys you one drink at most places.\n\nthe place is easy to miss if you're driving by, just pull into the kinko's parking lot. also, the gay waiters will make your straight female friends fall in love with them."""""""
4	"""I had heard a lot about CD, and while I'm not familiar with the Fox concept restaurants, I was excited to try this place out tonight with some of my guy friends. We rolled in at around 9:30p and were quickly greeted and sat down. The place, located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, is pretty \swanky\"""" and really spacious. A great place for large groups I'd say. We got a table in front of the kitchen and had some waters to start. \n\nAfter looking over the daunting menu for a couple minutes, we decided on what to go. We started off with the homemade potato chips and pretzel fondue to start, both of which were really good. I'm partial to pretzels so I liked that a little better, but the chips were also good with the dip. I had the something punch to drink which was really good, love the mixing of the fruit juices. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich which comes on a pretzel roll which, from what I ate, was delicious. I just had my wisdom teeth removed and can only tolerate so much chewing, so unfortunately I couldn't finish but I have my leftovers in the fridge! Anyways, everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, and we finished it all off with the apple monkey bread which was also very good. \n\nIt's the kind of place that isn't really pricy but it adds up (between the four of us our bill was $100+, but that was also with apps and drinks, so it's really worth it. Plus the food is really good. I'll definitely be back."""""""
4	My kind of place...\nThanks to Gabi M I first discovered the loveliness of Arcadia Farms about a year ago. We dined on their beautiful outdoor patio while enjoying healthy salads. I ordered the Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad, which was fabulous until I had an allergic reaction to it and spent 20 min throwing up in the bathroom. Lovely, I know.  Arcadia Farms isn't to blame though because I'm allergic to everything!\n\nLast week we skipped out on the beautiful atmosphere and picked up our salads to go. Of course I stayed away from the shrimp salad this time and went with some sort of grilled chicken salad. I ate up every last bite and no allergic reactions this time around. Whoo hoo!\n\nBased on the ambiance and food it's clear why this is many a yelpers favorite lunch spot.
3	Now that we have a tiny Shiba Inu to take care of, PetSmart is becoming a regular stop on the weekends. So far we've purchased treats, toys and a container for food storage. I'm noticing that the prices at PetSmart are definitely higher than Target and Amazon.com. Also, there never seems to be any employees around when I have a question...There's a Cost Plus next door to this location so if I'm shopping there I'll stop by PetSmart. Otherwise, I think I'll be purchasing my dog care and toys on Amazon in the future.
3	I am going to have to say, I just do not know what all the fuss is about with this place.\nI have been here a few times or more over many years.\nThe service is good however, The food is just not that fabulous!\nI think that they think if they get people to drink a lot,with their cheap Margaritas they will not notice the bland tatse. \nI have given it many trys but, I just cannot do better than a 3 star for them. \nThey are a good location right on the corner, and they always seem to be busy. \nThey have been there for as long as I can remember as well.\nJust not loving the food here.
3	The BF and I went here for lunch today because we had a living social deal that was expiring next week, so we needed to eat here pronto. Anyway, I was really looking forward to the 'amazing' carne asada. We ordered at the counter, I got the carne asada burrito, the BF got barbacoa tacos and we got a side of guac. The guac came out with three other salsas and some seemingly home made chips. The chips were good, as was the guac. The red and green salsas were too watery and not very flavorful. The chunky salsa with onion and peppers was very tasty, so I was excited for the meal. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. I thought both the barbacoa and the carne was bland and too chewy. Both meals were in desperate need of salsa to make them taste like something. Pretty disappointing. The beans and rice were alright, but not enough to go back. \n\n\nPS although the people who worked there were nice, the lady at the counter complained to me that they don't make any money with LS deals.... Sorry, but I thought that was unprofessional. No one forced them to participate in the deal.
4	A great coffee place, with exceptional service and awesome coffee.  The only problem is the front door -- if you happen to be sitting at either of the two front tables, the interminable slamming of the door makes this place unbearable.\n\nTip: if you can sit towards the back of the shop, or take your coffee to go, do it!\n\nTip to Owners/Management: why not replace your front door with one that is weighted and closes slowly -- obviously your customers don't care that it slams shut, so you all should look into doing something about it, or make the front area not a seating area.
5	It was a cold a blustery day at the ball park when we visited Salt River Fields.  We were there to watch the Angels vs. Rockies game.  The stadium is very close to the freeway, and there is a large shopping center right next door.  Therefore, you can come early to get eats or whatever then just go to the game.  \n\nWhen you walk into the stadium, you are met with that beautiful green and brown panorama that is totally unique to baseball.  The stadium has an intimate feel even though it is one of the newer and larger Cactus League stadiums.  It is very clean, and restrooms are plentiful.\n\nMy son got some cheese popcorn and cotton candy.  I got a Chicago dog with onions, tomatoes, pickle spears, and peppers.  The food was good at decent ballpark prices.\n\nOur seats were right on the third base line, so we had a really nice view.  The crowd was really nice and friendly.  There were quire a few Angels fans in attendance.  Everyone got along fine.\n\nUnfortunately, the Angels lost, but I will definitely come back to Salt River Fields.
4	I've always been a fan of Claim Jumper. Someone called it Cracker Barrel on steroids and I laughed so hard because that's exactly what you will experience.\n\nTheir food is amazing. That isn't an argument at all. Be prepared to have leftovers that will last you until the next rainy season, seriously. The prices are really expensive because you're not buying a meal, you're investing in a series of meals. \n\nMy problem the last time I came here was the service. The waitress was kind of rude and kept giving us dirty looks. Then when the food came out my mashed potatoes had gravy on them. The menu didn't say they came with gravy and she never asked me if I wanted gravy. I am physically incapable of eating gravy. Is it just me or is gravy the kind of thing you're supposed to ask if someone wants before just assuming? If it had been on the menu I would have asked for none. I was really sad about this because I love their mashed potatoes. \n\nMy mom ordered a piece of chocolate cake the size of a whale. I was both terrified and astounded by this beast. I don't eat chocolate but they all said it was great. I'll have to believe them.\n\nI wish I could pick 3.5 but whatever.
4	Impressed  , stopped 2 x before and the wait was to long . Made reservations for 5 this time.;).. Friends had recommened and raved about Becketts and had this on the short list for awhile. It was everything as advertised, ambiance very casual , GOOD Food, excellent service (  Adria was very good and made good recommendations ) and fair prices . Recommend the Osso  Bucco pork but not a bad meal by the group . Sunday is AZ winery special which is a nice touch , must try the Pimms cup cocktail excellent! Can't wait to go back!,!,
4	I grew up in San Jose in an area where there was a decent Indian population (lots of good Indian food spots) and moving out here to AZ I was worried if I was going to find good some Samosas or Chana Batura. Little India is a tiny Indian supermarket in a Plaza with a small kitchen in the back. You check on a list of what you foods you'd like and hand it over to the cook in the back. There are tables and chairs inside the tiny market so you can enjoy the Indian supermarket atmosphere while you're eating. I recommend the Samosas and Chana Batura. Reasonably priced. While I am not an expert on Indian food- all I can say is I left happy and satisfied. Hole-in-the-wall Indian food for the win!
3	I never knew this place existed until I saw the reviews on Yelp, and I live right down the street. \nI went for breakfast. It was kind of difficult to find. We sat on the patio so we could enjoy the weather and watch the planes take off and land. I ordered the chorizo burrito that was recommend by the server. It was served with hash-browns and wrapped in a tomato basil tortilla. It was really good, a bit spicy and a lot greasy. The ham steak looked good as did the omelets. The server was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice (except for the loads of kids). Try this little place, its a cute hide away with good food.
5	I love Pita Jungle! \n\nThe food is amazing-- for something spicy check out Chicken Del Sol or jalapeno cilantro hummus. My favorite is the Chicken pasta salad. It's served cold with a vinaigrette dressing and hot grilled chicken- absolutely delicious! I also love their greek and grilled vegetable salads. The food is fresh and according to the nutritional facts on their website, healthy. I never have regret about eating everything on my plate at Pita Jungle.\n\nAs locations go, this is one of the better Pita Jungle's. Parking seems to plague every location and this PJ is no exception. During the week it's always difficult to find a place to park but you get lucky later in the evening or on weekends. It's kind of tucked away between office buildings just north of the 101 on Tatum, but this location seems to be one of the bigger Pita Jungle's. They have a huge outdoor patio complete with heaters for winter and misters for summer.  \n\nHappy hour and reverse happy hour offer great deals, but they are small portions (hey for $1 order a couple). Otherwise the price is good for what you get.
5	"""To parapphrase the newspaper review that proudly stands on the counter of this quaint restaurant, \Don't come here, because if you to start coming regularly, this place is small enough where there won't be enough room for me.\""""\n\nDelicious!\n\nThe food is great, the prices even better.  3 Large Empanadas for $5.95?  It can't be beat.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Ceviche is a wonderful dish to order and share.  It comes in a large heavy glass goblet, almost theatrical, but if you want to impress some people, this is definitely fun to order."""""""
5	"""Perfectly executed comfort food. \n\nThe \fork tender\"""" short ribs lived up to their name, and I'm craving them as I write this. Mac 'n cheese was given a tangy, mustard seed Welsh rarebit twist, and I loved it. The veggie chop salad had a ton of variety and flavor. Chocolate bacon s'mores were so good, the table next to us ordered round after round of it.\n\nService was impeccable. Friendly, fast, and super-knowledgeable, and our server made us feel so welcome. \n\nAtmosphere is upscale casual, but not remotely pretentious. Very lively and friendly, with a diverse crowd.  \n\nThe wine list was exceptional, but the beer options were disappointing. \n\nDo call ahead to make reservations; We called a half hour before we wanted to arrive and were seated immediately, while walk-ins waited for forty-five minutes."""""""
3	I always said that my last meal on earth would consist of the AZ88 Chicken Sandwich and a dirty martini.  That was until I went there again the other night after a couple year hiatus.  The magic, was gone.  I was so disappointed and sad that it wasn't as memorable as I previously remember.  I will go back and try something else because I didn't have a bad experience and never have.\n\nI recently sat at the bar and had 2 different bartenders.  Both were great and entertaining.  And, it doesn't help that they poured a strong and delicious drink.  Get a martini!!
3	"""I always go straight for the sale rack, (when they do % off clearance pricing this is when you can get killer deals!) in fact I don't think I have EVER purchased something full price from an Urban Outfitters. I have been shopping UO since I lived in Vermont back in junior high school in the 90s. They are getting the rap of \wanna be a hipster, here's your uniform\"""", which is sort of unfair because much of their stuff is very basic, just with an edge. If you are looking for some over the top jacket or Latin style poncho vest, try Goodwill before shelling out $200 for something that looks like a hobo would wear."""""""
1	Wow. \nThis place sucks.\nHonestly, don't waste your time. The food is overpriced. The service is awful. I hate the parking structure. It's just a mess. \nA hot mess.\nHow are they staying open?\nMy arnold palmer was $2.50. The tea was flavored and tasted really gross with lemonade.\nWe split the house salad which was obviously the prepackaged spring mix from Costco (or Sysco -- whatevs) \nThen we split a medium pesto, tomato, and basil pizza. The tomatoes were not ripe, the sauce was bland, and the pesto was non existent. And then the 30 pine nuts that were smashed into the cheese were overkill.\nThe crust was fair.\nThe server took my plate before I was finished and then set it back down after she realized my fork was in my mouth.\nSo for two teas, a house salad, and a medium pizza our tab was $22 \n??? Costco Pizza would have been better.\nBleh.
5	I never knew this movie theater existed. I mean I don't frequent paradise valley mall that often, and when I go, I have tunnel vision as I go straight to the stores I need to go to and get the heck out of there. So when Travelzoo had their movie special ( two tickets, 1 large popcorn and two large drinks for $15), I couldn't pass it up. The theater is small but very quaint. The seats are EXTREMELY comfortable and they kinda recline. How cool is that. Plus the best part? the staff are super duper friendly. A huge win in my book. I will definitely be going back to this cute little hidden gem of a theater.
4	This is one of my favorite vietnamese food restaurants in the Phoenix area. Me and my roommate used to come here all the time, and the #22 (Bun Bo Hue) is my fav! But I haven't been here for almost 3 months since my roommie left the country  :(\n\nTheir menu has changed from the last time I was here, they added some pictures, and more importantly, prices have increased!!! I remembered #22 used to be $6.95, now is $7.95! However, I think it's still reasonable!\n\nWe had the #4, Spring Roll for appetizer, and I ordered #22 as usual and my friend had the signature pho, I guess is #15, but might be wrong..The food presented nicely, and tasted good! #22 is a spicy version of pho, with a different kind of rice noodle. These noodles are bigger and shorter than the regular pho (but not as big as udon), the soup is very spicy, and kinda of messy to eat (so many ingredients and little pieces of chill). If you never had it and can handle spicy pretty well, I recommend you to try #22!
4	For far to long I put this place at the rock bottom of my brewery list in town, it seems that I was mistaken.\n\nMany years had passed since my last visit here, and after an invite from some friends and a good tasting at the last yelp event I went in.\n\nWe sat on the large patio to enjoy the great spring AZ weather, it also enable us to accommodated upwards for 20 people at our conjoined table.\n\nHappy hour was in full effect $3.25 beers (in a mug) and $5 pizza's and appetizers.\n\nI started off with a stout, it was nice full bodied not to bitter and with a rich head. I learned that each beer is made on site with their own local recipes\n\nFor food I went with the margarita pizza ($5 on HH $10 normal).  TO my surprised it was cooked in a open flame oven and it was almost a Bianco style pizza, it had fresh motzrella , basil, tomatoes and pesto on it. It was pretty good but a bit low on the crust to topping ratio. \n\nService was decent for a large patio party too.\n\nHappy hr is  3:30pm - 6:30pm & 9-Close all days, give it a try
4	I enjoy coming here every so often for some fresh produce and baked goods.  I live about one mile away so it is convenient.  The produce is always fresh and affordable.  It is a great place to find some of the more exotic items like fresh lemon grass and other greens.   \n\nI usually spend about $10 to $15 for a couple of bags of vegetables and then go home and do my gastronomic magic.\n\nParking can be a struggle.  It seems that there is always someone in front of you creating a parking nightmare for no reason.\n\nThe fresh eggs taste great.  The fresh fish is good, but terribly overpriced.  I am especially fond of the specialized honey and by-products offered.\n\nA good way to spend a Saturday morning.
4	My husband and I always love this place.  We've catered from here for Superbowl events as well as gone to lunch and happy hour.  We also picked up some fresh roasted hatch chilis when they have them out front during promotional times.  They were amazing and we made some great dishes at home!\n\nOur favorite is the pollo con queso, but there are so many good menu items.  We often get the pollo con queso and something else to share so that we can try something new as well.  \n\nWe just went there tonight because Sundays kids eat free and that is just great! \n\nTheir patio is awesome because it has an indoor/outdoor feel and is backed by a waterfall for some sound ambiance!  \n\nGreat salsa, great food, great with kids, I love this place!
2	"""I'm going to break this down to explain my two stars. Here we go.\n\nTHE GOOD: \n* Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful, the chicken is tasty, all in all a great dish. \n* Chicken boti tikka (boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven) - also tasty, but have had better elsewhere\n* Naan - Really good stuff. Crisp and soft in all the right places - exactly how it should be made. Better than 95% of other Indo-Pakistani places in the Valley.\n\nTHE BAD:\n* Chintzy interior which seemed like you just warped yourself straight back to the Punjab somewhere, complete with water-stained panels on the ceiling. 99.99% of the time, this doesn't faze me at all, but something was a little off and I don't know why.\n* A surly \aunty type\"""" who's standing behind the register and doesn't even want to greet you unless you're apparently related to her or go to school with her kids\n* Said \""""aunty type\"""" disappears into the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, so you stand around and wait. And wait.\n* Said \""""aunty type\"""" expresses nonverbal displeasure when you ask her for anything. Case in point: Asking her for tamarind chutney. Even though you waited for your food for 30 minutes.\n* Said \""""aunty type\"""" brings back a tiny plastic cup of goopy, thick tamarind paste. Huh?\n* Said \""""aunty type\"""" doesn't say \""""thank you\"""", smile, or anything when you go up to pay, even though you've been nothing but friendly and appreciative. So much for engaging a potential repeat customer. She could care less about your patronage.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n* Big screen TV tuned to some badly acted Indian soap opera about some ancient king of Sri Lanka who tries to get it on with his handmaidens while his brother schemes for the throne while twisting one end of his moustache, but then switched to another channel showing bad, unknown songs from 4th-tier mid-90's Bollywood movies. Although I am not kidding you...there was one video where a guy and a girl were doing their running around and singing thing....in the SWISS ALPS. And then, all of a sudden, in the middle of all that snow, a table appears full of Indian food and an umbrella advertising beer and pretzels. WTF? \n\nSo, in the end, here's the equation:\n\n1 Pretty Good Food - 1 Dubious Dining Room - 1 Surly Aunty Type - 1 Singing/Shrieking Girl/Guy While Eating Curry On The Matterhorn Which Makes No Sense - 1 Overly Randy King of Ancient Sri Lanka Who No One Really Needs To See = 2 Stars.\n\nBah."""""""
3	Newest Szechuan restaurant in town ... 2 weeks old only ... Clean interior, good service and dishes come pretty fast. \n\nPretty good in quality but noting to wow just yet ... tried their water boiled fish, sour fish soup and a cold dishes. Water boiled fish was pretty good, not all that numbing compare to other restaurant, so it's good on my book, soup is pretty decent too. I will put this restaurant in the same tier as Szechuan palace
4	We went to the Saddle Ranch Chop House for my sister's 21st birthday.  It was a Monday night so it wasn't busy.  They gave us an arm band to get a discount on food the following day, which was cool.  \n\nThe nachos we ordered were HUGE(!) and yummy.  \n\nBecause it was my sister's birthday, they gave her free cotton candy.  Cotton Candy?!  I thought the same thing.  It was pretty awesome though.  \n\nThis place has a nice patio with a bar outside for smokers.  They have a mechanical bull and that was fun to watch.  Love the ambiance here.  Nice place all around.
5	Ahhh...the lingering country club lunches at Phil's Grill. Those were the days. When I lived in the white, homogenized and frankly, boring, world called DCRanch, I often met up with my roomie at Phil's. Sort of the anti Zipp's sports bar. Of course there are the obligatory plasma tvs. The views of the course are great as you nestle into a comfie sofa . I felt like the old farts in the movie Trading Places. We'd sit in those big leather chairs by the fireplace and count our money. Once, I counted $27 in one pocket alone! The food here is fantastic, as it should be for a mogul like myself. Favorites include the Sonoran chicken pasta with fresh grilled corn, the prime rib slider (how old  money is that?!) and the Southwestern wrap. The menu does include high end steaks running up to $37 or so. I would have ordered that. But was unable to find another $10 in my other pockets.
3	"""Several months ago my local Safeway gave away black recycling bags with goodies as a TV promo.  I tossed the junk food & coupons but kept the bag in my car.  I use it at TJ's & Sprouts to save plastic and paper bags.  I would like to see one or more of the grocery chains repeat the give-away with no commercial logos except for the recycling emblem on Earth Day April 22.  As far as my local Safeway goes I am there at the crack of dawn most mornings for my tall drip at the inside Starbucks.

5	Hands down -My fave Irish pub .\n\nGreat Bartenders that will offer you cheeky Irish banter AND are on top of your glass /pint or bottle of beer .\n\nSpot on Irish Fare ,extra seating can be found up in the loft area .small covered patio,that can seat about 40. Dark wood 4 sided bar cute little Irish Knick-Knacks scattered through out . \n\nAnd some of the best damn live entertainment in the valley plays here ....from one man acoustic to 8 piece band ..all who play in this house ,truly rock !\n\nNever had a bad time here ! Love it !
2	We had let a car sit for 5 months and took it in for an oil change.\n\nPositives: Oil change for $23.  They took a little over an hour to do the oil change.\n\nNegatives: They don't seem honest.  Like many oil change places, they try to up-sell.  They suggested an alignment, balancing the tires, air filter change, and new battery.  The battery was 2 days old and the air filter has only had 7 months of driving done with it.  I'm taking it to another shop to get a second opinion about the alignment and balancing.
5	I'm not sure I can put Cibo on par with Pizzeria Bianco. I just can't.\n\nIt's pretty close, though. And when you factor in wait times (15 minutes on a First Friday night at 7pm), parking (much better, being on the west side of downtown), and leftovers (the pizza crust holds up remarkably well under microwaving), it's really no question.\n\nWe started with the burrata, and I really can't recommend this enough: two mountains of creamy, fresh mozzarella, sliced prosciutto that melts in your mouth, and toasted bread that's just soft enough to keep from dicing the roof of your mouth. The only problem was, by the end of it (and we scraped every bit of cheese up) we were hardly hungry. Between the two pizzas we ordered between my wife, me, and our daughter, we finished less than half. From now on, we'll go with the burrata, and split a pie...though then we'd miss out on the leftovers. I'll have to rethink this.\n\nA few minor quibbles: it'd be nice of the beers were on tap. My Lagunitas IPA wasn't quite cold enough. Also, the main entrance is a tight fit, but it's worth it for the ambiance, I think.\n\nBeyond that, though, everything about Cibo, from the food to the charming owners, was exceptional. I only half-jested that I'd like to go back today.
4	awww.. this place brings good memories, always. yea, sure they play the same songs, but seriously people...how many songs can you memorize, sing, and perform? these people are talented and great fun! i had a wonderful birthday here a few years ago. \n\nget there early so you get a decent seat. the songs are good and the singers and performers are really entertaining. requesting songs here reminds me of requesting songs on the radio back in the day. oh, and maybe some of you who frequent are annoyed by now of the napoleon dynamite dance, but i loved it.
2	I've been here about 4-5 times for the lunch buffet over several years, always hoping for a better experience.  The price is right for the lunch buffet but the quality of the pizza is shabby.  As another reviewer stated well; salty.  If you order a regular pizza it is not nearly as bad tasting as the lunch buffet.   \n\nThe restaurant is well worn out, cramped seating, and normally only two staff checking customers out, seating, refilling drinks etc.  Seems very under staffed.\n\nI do not know why I continue to have faith in this place; however it is time for a change of location and never here again!!
4	Another great new location from the Corieri's, creators of Axis/Radius, Suede Lounge, Myst, Sandbar and, for those who remember, Jetz and Stixx.\n\nRnR is located in a brand new building on the South edge of Oldtown Scottsdale and right across the street from the former Billet Bar (I don't know its new name). The atmosphere is your typical Scottsdale eatery/sports bar. Big flatscreen TV's, large bar and lots of attractive people in designer jeans. There's both indoor and outdoor seating and its definitely a place to start the night before heading out for the Scottsdale club scene.\n\nThe service was quick and very good. I had the sirloin steak sandwich with sweet potato fries while others in my party tried various burgers and salads. My sandwich was excellent and others enjoyed their food as well. The fries are served in a small bucket and reminded me of the ones at Delux Burger.\n\nThe only reason RnR loses a star is that once the football game ended, the music was turned up so loud that it was practically impossible to hear the people at my own table. \n\nI can see turning up the music later in the evening, but we were there on Sunday night and the NFL playoff game ended at about 6:00 which still strikes me as the dinner hour and it was disconcerting to have the music get so loud so early.
3	THE GOOD:\nThe boba and tea here tastes sooo much better than other places. \nYou can play games while you wait.\nThe food and snacks are very tasteful. \n\nTHE BAD:\nIt is much more expensive than the other boba places in the area.\nThere is also a 50 cent charge for using your visa/credit cards for purchases under $10.00 so bring cash!\nDo not expect customer service. \n\nTHE UGLY:\nThe sarcastic asian lady boss. If you are looking for water, please bring your own cup because she doesn't give out water cups. \nAlso, if you're not gonna buy anything, don't bother going in, she will give you mean looks until you leave her place of business.
5	Oh, you little broker of sushi you. how fun you are. whats that? you dont like sushi? well. dont fret. they also have sliders. yeah. like chicken. and beef. and probably a spicy tuna slider also. but only if you ask nicely. \n\ni've only ever been for happy hour, and it hit the spot! we tried about 5-6 different menu items, all at least 50% off ($20 roll for $10? yup. 2 please). drinks are strong; who doesnt love that? probably the same person that doesnt like my reveiws because my witty banter is lame. ha! \n\nseriously though, its awesome. try it. you'll love it. trust me cause im trustworthy.
3	"""I think I'm kind of torn on this place. Strictly for the food, it's a good burger. I had the samburger (I think that's what it was called) cheese, bacon, lettuce, and thousand island dressing. It was cooked medium, just like I requested, and it was a good sized meal (I only ate half, and was full). The bun was a tasty wheat bread, and the meat was of great quality, good texture, and great flavor. \n\nI also split an order of sweet potato fries, which were good, but nothing to write home about. I'd be interested to try the zucchini fries they have though. \n\nThe beer selection here is good, some non standards on tap, such as Left Hand Polestar Pilsner (which was a bit disappointing compared to some of LH's other offerings, but that's nothing against the restaurant) and one of my favorites, Deschutes Black Butte Porter. Pricing on the drinks was as expected for the upscale area, at $5.50/pint. \n\nI do regret not trying the milkshakes, because they looked damn good, but quite frankly, I just can't eat that much. The menu is simple, but offers enough variety to keep in interesting. So far so good, right???? \n\nWell, here's where I become torn. The burgers are $10+, fries were extra at $6 (shared) and the beers were $5.50/pint. So, for two burgers, a split order of fries, two pints, tax, and tip, I spent over $60. Yes, it was good, but $60 for burgers and fries seems a bit steep, no matter how good. Not helping their cause, is Delux. If I remember correctly, the burgers at Delux were around $8, and were just as good, or maybe even better, fries were still shared, and their beer selection terrific! (selection is good, but it's all on tap, which scores big points in my book) \n\nIn the end, the magic adjective is \good.\""""  Zinburger is good. The service was good, helpful, and nice, and the place had a good ambiance and vibe. If it were a little less expensive and/or Delux didn't exist, this would be my go to burger joint in the area."""""""
4	"""Is it just me, or does the word, \extreme\"""" or in this case \""""xtreme\"""" seem a bit antiquated now: like back from a time when everything had to be \""""extreme!\"""" \n\nThat said, I've enjoyed hanging and studying at Xtreme (God, do I hate writing it that way). The coffee and chai have never wowed me, but they do have an excellent selection of teas and good service. I've enjoyed the various musical performers on the weekends when the place is open all night, a rarity in Phoenix and definitely appreciated. \n\nAlthough the space feels a bit corporate for some reason (maybe its because of its original purpose as a bank or so says a fellow Yelper),  I've found a very mixed crowd there, which makes up for the space. On a typical weekend night I'll see tons of students studying others listening to the live music, while still more engage in interesting conversation. It's a nice way to go out for a quieter night. I dig the outdoor seating too.\n\nAlthough I prefer other Tempe cafes to, ahem, Xtreme, its great hours and weekend vibe have been key to my repeated visits."""""""
3	Oh, Postino, so much to offer, yet...you still lack...something. Here is Postino's entire menu: Wine and toast. That's pretty much it. And yet it is always jam-packed. Maybe it's supposed to be a bar with better food? Maybe it's a restaurant with few options? Either way, it seems like a great place to take a first date or to scope for one because it's always full middle-class people eating toast. I think they're bored. You can be the exciting one for a change.
5	Definitely one of my favorite places. They have the best Chai I have ever tasted. Their Chai is nice and creamy and delicious hot or iced. Much better than Starbucks! C4 has a cozy environment with places to dine or comfy couches to lounge on. The patio is a favorite for locals to sit and chat. Food- I have only tried their breakfast. It is tasty and served with a smile. Their pastries are top notch and the burrito is to die for! I drive out of my way 20 minutes to get there and it's worth it!!
2	I hate to be a downer....\n\nMy dear friend and I came in after our mid morning trip to the gym hoping to get some coffee and a light bite.\n\nI settled on the Organic yogurt and granola and a protein shake after asking a few questions about the granola (I don't like oily granola) and inquiring about the brand of protein powder used. I didn't feel like my questions were answered very well but I was hungry and it was crunch time. My friend got a vanilla latte and a tuna sandwich....we sat down....\n\nI watch the guy begin to make my protein shake....The container for the Protein read Smart Gainer http://www.nextag.com/ids-smart-gainer/search-html 600 calories and counting.  read it for yourself...make since for a weight lifter or a very skinny person trying to gain weight....but I just came from the gym and worked really hard to run off those damn calories. I do not want my protein shake to be a weight gainer....I want in to be what it say it is...simple protein shake.....anyway I watched them make my granola as well...not Organic like they said. I think its important to use what you say you are using...they were using yoplait. Not organic. Humph.\n\nOn the other hand the tuna sand was pretty good....props on the sandwich but I'm not coming back anytime soon.
4	South Mountain is one of the most popular areas for mountain bikers and hiking enthusiasts.  Some of the views on some trails are spectacular as you can see a good view of the valley from a horizontal perspective.  There are several trails and can be lost easily.  I suggest going with a friend who knows the trails or looking up a map ahead of time.  There are a few different entrance from Baseline Rd.  I would suggest going south on 46th street from Baseline.  There isn't as many people, so parking should be easy.  If you take this route, go through the Javelina trail, which will then lead you to the Ridge Trail.  The Ridge Trail has minor elevation gain, but it is great for your heart.  You will go left onto the Beverly Canyon trail which will lead you back to the parking lot.  This is about a 3.5 mile hike that will take anywhere from 1.5 to 2 hours.  The hike isn't as intense as Camelback, so you may not a Camelback backpack, but water bottle or Gatorade bottle should suffice.
3	Ok... this place isn't where you want to take your date for a romantic dinner. It's loud, it's busy, it's very kid-friendly, and the floor is littered with peanut shells.\n   Our server was incredible and that tends to set the tone for me. She was quick with our refills and kept the bread and cinnamon butter coming.\n   I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my husband ordered ribs. We also ordered the Cactus Blossom appetizer. \n   My steak was cooked to perfection and I felt that aside from the lack luster side dishes, it was worth the money. My husband's ribs were good, but on the dry side. The appetizer was delicious! The apple pie we ordered for dessert was ok. It came with this weird caramel topping stuff that had the consistency of mucus. Not very appetizing. \n   I didn't show up expecting a Ruth's Chris experience. But I was happy with the place as a whole. I probably wouldn't go again on a weekend, but I could see coming here again with my family.
4	This is definitely THE place to get crepes in town. The variety is vast and the ingredients are fresh!\n\nThe crepe is a little bit tough and thick, but I think it might be by design because they pack so much real ingredients in it that it needs to be able to hold them in.\n\nI ordered The Shirley with banana. It is Cream Cheese, Nutella, Strawberries w/ Whip Cream & Chocolate Sauce. I wanted some banana with it to make it even more tasty. It was huge and delicious~ I think it should be considered healthy since I had strawberries and banana... :P\n\nMy hubby ordered Graceland (Peanut Butter, Bananas & Honey) and a Bacon Egg & Cheese breakfast crepe. Both were delicious. \n\nBacon Egg & Cheese was very satisfying for breakfast. Graceland hit the spot for my hubby's peanut butter craving.\n\nWe can't wait to head back and try out all the other items on their Savory Crepe menu.
3	The setting is fantastic, I can't think of any better place to hang while eating. That being said the food is not as great as the setting, the food is to expensive and ok. I've had things I like and others that I don't care for. JFG does grow a lot of their own food and that is a major plus but the food doesn't bring me back.\n\nAlso don't get BBQ here is isn't nearly as great as Joes real BBQ
4	Had lunch here for the first time yesterday and thought the atmosphere was smart, current and open.  Menu was diverse and unique enough and there was a lot to tempt me, a big fresh-Mex fan.  \n\nService was undeniably slow and drinks were especially under-served.  This was a shame, as my cohorts were sloshin' it up and the proprietor could have generated some serious revenue on those margs if someone was willing to serve them! \n\nI had the shrimp tacos which weren't nearly as good as the shrimp/ancho tacos at Jasper's Bistro, but still quite tasty and served hot.  Chips & salsa are great, too.  \n\nAll in all, only the service brought us down.  It's never fun to have to ask for something twice, right? But one server does not kill a restaurant for me...I'll give them another chance and I'm hopeful they'll figure it out!
1	This place is characterized by rude service, okay food, and a generally callous attitude toward customers . Ideally, this place would suit those who are looking for an awful evening in a nice part of town!  If you are anything other than lily white, blondes preferred,   expect to wait an eternity for any service.  The waitress we were unlucky to get was indeed a RACIST.  She was downright belligerent and rude, behaving as if she was doing us a favor by even getting us food and drinks. We were a group of eight people and had a tab in the $400-500 range yet got lousy service.  The manager was not helpful either and his attitude was simply that the waitress is usually very good - this despite the fact that we complained that she was awful. I have been here twice and will NEVER GO HERE again.
3	"""Hole in the wall? This feels like an \in the know\"""" locals place.  It was recommended to me by one. The neighborhood has been battered by the economic downturn and seen better days, and you don't expect tourists to flock here, as their resorts are away from here. The burger, simply seared on a flat plate (that appears not to have been cleaned in 50 years) gives the beef the perfect char that seals in the juice.  The marinade in red wine gives the beef an edge up in flavor.  Unique.  Also like the wet fries. Airport close; worthy of a side trip."""""""
3	I've definitely had better.  The food was good, but nothing I'd go back for.  I enjoyed the food at the little hole-in-the-wall across the street (Taqueria Los Angeles)  far more.  There was no comparison.  \n\nI ordered a couple machaca soft tacos and a chimichanga.  They were busy, but not overwhelmed.  It took 25 minutes to get my food.  People were getting a bit testy and a couple made a scene about the slow service. \n\nI think the tortillas would have been good, but the tacos were so wet, I couldn't pick them up without them falling apart.  The machaca was bland until I doused them with salsa... that I had to ask for.   \n\nThe chimichanga was good... loaded with the machaca beef.  It was still a bit bland though, but salsa helped.\n\nI don't know if I'll go back.
5	I was a little worried about the menu at first but the great staff broke everything down and showed that the food is the star of the show and not the menu.  \n\nI was very excited to see new and exciting ingredients on a scottsdale menu and have become a fan of the relaxed culture of the restaurant and the food being served.  I enjoyed some really cool beers, amazing fries, and I think the best steak sandwhich this side of Philly.  Everything about the restaurant is fresh, exciting, and new to me and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other inspired dishes on the menu.  It is my understanding that the trout and rabbit are must haves and i will in the near future.\n\nPlease feel free to use this as a suggestion and try new fare in a hip but relaxed atmosphere with great drinks, fantastic grub, and a chance to expand your culinary palate.\n\nCheers,\nSW
4	"""Many of the stores in Tempe seem to me to be shadowed by better ones in larger cities. Not so Tempe Camera. I'm not a camera expert but they seem to have a huge range of items and services. The prices do seem a little high, but I've gotten good service from them many times.\n\nI would double check on some of their facts, however. A friend of mine went in recently and was told they didn't have any more Kodak 8mm film as \they don't make them anymore.\"""" A quick check on the Kodak website revealed that wasn't true."""""""
3	It's been a while since I have been here but I stopped in with mom the other day, so I figured now is a good time to give it a review. \n\nDecent pizza. I like the thin crust. This is a thin crust pizza that needs to be eaten with a fork and knife. Not crispy enough to pick up. \n\nThe servers were very affectionate. By that I mean they called my mom babe and me love. I thought maybe it was just our server until I heard the server at the next table refer to her diners as sweetie and hun. Not a bad thing at all. Just kind of funny. And sweet. =) \n\nSo if you are looking for someone to call you sweet nicknames while eating good pizza this is the place for you!
5	"""Four Peaks is an excellent establishment because they have wonderful food, a very robust beer selection (brewed on site), and incredible atmosphere. If you are familiar with Arizona, you'll know that being outdoors is either the best idea or the worst idea based on the time of day. Four Peaks offers you convenience of indoor or outdoor seating and plenty of room for you and your friends.\n\nI have to rant about their food. All of their appetizers are delicious. I haven't had a drink I didn't enjoy. Their hamburgers are out of this world. Their fried foods are excellent. Their salads are so big and filling. You can't go wrong.\n\nThere are two sets of restrooms. Service can be flaky. On Fri/Sat, show up 30 minutes before you want to be seated, and enjoy a drink at the bar. Make sure you bring your ID as you will be carded. They are not afraid to destroy the iffy fake ID cards. The atmosphere is excellent because it is near the college but draws adults of all ages. It's a fantastic place to relax. EXTREMELY good for groups! Just be sure to show up early.\n\nI like to think of a 5 star establishment as a place I wouldn't be ashamed of dying in. \Oh wow, he died while at Four Peaks?\"""" \""""Yeah...yeah that place was pretty good\"""". They'll remember me in a good light."""""""
4	I'm continuing with my downtown streak of reviews... I finally made it to Switch!  This review is for my experience at lunchtime... and let me warn you, it gets busy during the weekday lunch hours, so go early or go late, but arrive at noon, and more than likely you will have to wait.  However, the community table is an option if you go solo or with a small group.\n\nAnother warning - the parking situation at noon - I think I lucked out and got the last spot in the lot; I happened to see a truck leaving when I came in, but there didn't seem to be any other open spots.  I noticed that Durant's next door offered 'humble valet parking' (interesting signage), but not sure if you are dining at Switch where you would park in this scenario.\n\nI walked in through the back, and I liked the atmosphere and vibe immediately.  I was told there was a 20 minute wait for my party of 3, so I found myself a seat and did some work while I waited.  Pretty sure they have WiFi although I was using my Verizon card.  Great people watching was distracting me too; enough so that I missed when the rest of my party walked in!  Anyways, I caught up with them and enjoyed a great lunch...\n\nService was right on, and it was an overall delightful dining experience.  I had the 'Super Chop' salad - it had a little bit of everything in it (artichokes, olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, corn, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach & field greens) - and I added turkey for a small extra charge... it was a huge serving and the perfect healthy lunch!  (Note to self and to anyone else that may be interested in adding protein to your salad in the future - go with something other than the turkey... I hate to sound picky, but it wasn't amazing).  Anyways, my two new friends (Kate and Angie) are regulars at Switch, so they ordered the hummus and lamb apps and shared - good idea!  I tried the hummus and it was tasty - I like how they served it with pita and sides of artichokes and peppers.  It was a tad different than the hummus at Fez, or at least that is what we all decided.\n\nWe were all very satisfied and too full for dessert... I guess I'll have to come back to try that another time.  Dessert and a bunch of other menu items that sounded good.  I also noticed that Switch serves breakfast all day on Saturday and Sundays, and does catering - good to know!
4	I wasn't surprised to see this place was 24 hours, on first glance it just looked like a Mexican place crammed into an old burger spot. But I'm more than happy with my California burrito (which includes french fries and guacamole), but I had to request beans.\n\nBig, like a good burrito should be and help-yourself chips and salsa. I'd definitely eat here again. (and I can imagine having to convince whoever I'm bringing here, yeah, it doesn't look like much--but it's good!)
3	Sweet Tomatoes- land of the flavorless food.  \n\nIf you're going to go to a restaurant like this, at least go to Super Salad. It's a little less expensive and much better.\n\nI don't go anymore, but of the times I've been to Sweet Tomatoes, anything I've tried (aside from the salad) is extremely bland. \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's pizza, pasta or bread, nothing from this restaurant has flavor. Although the food itself isn't awful, I can't describe any one item as being good either. \n\nMy advice: Eat a salad at home before wasting your money here
4	I decided to go ahead and review this bar again. I'm upping my initial rating of three stars to four. Since the initial review, this bar has gone to great lengths to bring something interesting to do in my neck of the woods each night of the week. I love the live jazz music on Sunday nights. I love the events on First Friday. And most of all, I love the crowd and community that is building in downtown Phoenix that spots like this are helping to foster\n\nI recently took a friend here that lives in Tempe and doesn't venture to Phoenix much.. We tend to go to Casey Moore's often when we're out in Tempe. He compared the Lost Lead to a more sophisticated Casey Moore's. I'd say that's a pretty accurate description. It's inviting and free of pretension, while at the same time bringing that smart and edgy flavor that Phoenix is all about. I love this bar!
5	The people at LTD are honest, hard-working and great to work with! I've used their services on multiple occasions and have always been impressed with their reasonable prices, great service and professionalism. I highy recommend them for all your wedding or party needs, and will use them again with total confidence! \n\nI've attended and hosted events at their Studio 5C venue which is a great location that's perfect for parties and events. I held my rehearsal dinner here last April and my guests were very impressed; the views of Tempe are pretty awesome from the patio...I think this place has way more appeal than all the other generic event venues out there that I've seen :-)
1	This place can eat my ass!! I went to the deli to get a sandwhich. \n\nSo I asked the clerk if they used any partially hydrogenated oils.\n\nShe had to call her corporate office.\n\nThey called her back to tell her the verdict...........................\n\n(..........................= drumroll)\n\nBingo!  The harmfull oil is in there wheat bread and the white bread!!!\n\nAMAZING!! I could never support a supposed health food store that uses an oil like that. \n\nIf you dont know how bad it is. peep this out\n\nbantransfat.com
3	We played here yesterday for our annual Chili's softball tournament. The park is perfect for baseball, softball, or volleyball tournaments with a plethora of fields for each sport. They have batting cages that you can use while you wait for your next game. I'm not sure how much these were but I couldn't imagine them being very expensive. The only issue I had was their lack of first aid. I was pretty scraped up from a couple rough slides and I had nothing to cover my injuries. I would highly recommend bringing some first aid equipment if you plan on playing here. Also, the umpires were a little, uh, interesting is a good term. A couple looked (and acted) like drug addicts, one made slightly uncomfortable comments to me at catcher, and another called a couple of the players names. I really like the park in itself though, and I wouldn't mind playing here again.
5	Forgot the straw... but still five stars!\n\nI was in Scottsdale for work, and wanted to relax in my hotel room after a long day of meetings.  Not being from the area, I googled delivery, and Rome's Pizza came up.  Friendly woman on the phone, and from previous reviews, she must be in the family of this self-owned and run business.  My bolognese and fettuccine came within the promised half hour, and the food was fresh.  Delivery guy was nice and friendly.  Probably the most delicious delivery pasta I've ever had.  Even the salad was fresh and I don't think it was prepackaged, as many pizza places do.  Yes they forgot the straw for my drink, but I definitely recommend... for both in- and out-of-towners!
3	"""I will start with positives in the hope that a manager or owner who reads this will take it as true constructive feedback.  \nThe atmosphere of this place is great.  I love that the music is a little loud sometimes, not all the times. I love the choice of music.  I love the big open feel and the amazing patio.  The concept of what is trying to happen here is great.  Local, fresh organic menu, and a simple (although never changing) menu at that. It brings character and a very urban feel in to Ahwatukee, which, for all intense and purposes completely lacks.  The Gallo Torta is phenomenal.  3 stars\n\nI have been coming here for 2-3 times a week for the last 6 months.  I've had dinner and many a breakfast here.   Almost every single time I have been here, the thought has crossed my mind, \the service is so bad here\"""".  There is a pretty regular rotation of 4-5 people who work the counter, taking my money.  I don't think a single one of them has ever looked at me in the eye.  No one here but maybe the taller woman, who looks like an owner, looks at people, smiles and says hello?  Its the craziest thing I've ever seen.  You are in Ahwatukee! not downtown SF... \n\nI have asked on several occasions if I could deviate from the menu and create a egg scramble with the ingredients that are all already on the menu. Every time I am met with, \""""huh, oh.. well yeah. I guess you could.\"""" then me, \""""are you sure?\"""", them \"""" uhhh, well.... yea. I mean... i yea... I guess.\""""  me \""""Ok.. I ll just have the gallo torta\"""".\n\""""Ok.\""""  \n\n\nI am a regular! and the request is simple.. sheesh! Another thing.  Your cartel coffee coffee situation is in desperate need of attention.  You have like two barista's that make espresso in two totally different ways, and both are miserable. You have all the tools to make great coffee yet you don't.  The house coffee is seemingly very watered down as well. But this is a matter of my own preference and maybe isn't relevant here.  \nThe place is always busy and I'm sure will be financially successful for years to come.  However, as I sit here writing this inside hillside spot, I believe this will be my last visit here.  Thanks for all the wifi."""""""
4	I've never been disappointed by the food here. This is where I take my parents when they visit and where we go when we want to relax over a bottle of wine and consistently tasty food. Service can be a little.. silly... seems like they hire a lot of high school kids, but it's never been a problem, just a source of entertainment. \n\nAnyway, we don't go here too much because it's kind of pricey but for a quieter sort of special evening, sit on the patio in the comfy outdoor seating and be sure to order the chocolate cake dessert.
2	The only excellent in this restaurants was the customer services. The restaurants need major makeover so plain and duck tape all over the places unless they are planning to do so. The food was not my favorite seem they can't keep up with standard. The onion rings was so terrible so oily ( not eatable ) eh mm BK make much better onion rings than what they served on us.  Grilled Salmon was so dry aka overcooked plus leave fresh strongly fishy smell.
4	Basically, a laundromat is a laundromat is a laundromat. Usually. This place is definitely different. It's decidedly not creepy, which is nice, has half a dozen or so big screen tvs, and it's pretty clean. They've got different size washers from single load up to 6 loads, perfect for blankets, bedding etc. They also have huge 50lb dryers that will fit all the large loads AND get them dry. No more having to throw 2 pairs of jeans in one dryer, a handful of shirts in another, and hoping for the best. The free wi-fi is a nice perk, but it would be nice if there were more tables or counters to sit at rather than having to balance your laptop on your lap. The parking situation is less than ideal, but it's the lesser of the evils. \n\nWhat really set this place apart was the service. We went on a Sunday with a ridiculous amount of laundry. We had loads going in 4 or 5 different washers. As a result, we ended up accidentally forgetting a load there. We called on Monday, around 9pm, and the girl there went to check, saw that the clothes were actually still in the washer, and put them in a bag, and said she'd hold them for us until we went back to get them. \n\nI don't know many laundry places that even have a staff on site, much less someone who would go that extra mile for us. \n\nTip: the 5 load washers are the best deal. A single load is $1.25, the 5 load washer is $4.25.
3	"""Having heard of this place on TV (Food network, I think) and my son who goes to school in AZ, the whole family, including my vegetarian only wife, just 'had' to try the place. \n\nI would say that the place pretty much lives up to its name as being a gut busting, caloric inducing burger joint. Not for the faint of heart, I just got a single burger (is that what they call them?), fries, a coke, and shared my wife's Vanilla shake.  I must have ate/drank over 3k worth of calories in one sitting. \n\nI am an avid runner with a half marathon, 10k's, etc under my belt and I just had to run a full marathon (26.2 miles) the next day to cleanse myself of what I ate the day before. I really didn't run a marathon the next day, but like one reviewer said, \The next morning, most of us who'd eaten there were still full.\"""" \n\nWould I eat there again? Sure, next year as its a great place to go to check out if you are in the area, but part of your regular diet, no way! But don't think my review is all about hating the joint, it's a great place. I even talked to the \""""doctor' himself and had dreams of expanding. With America's gluttony, I think he might even be successful at it in places like Dallas, Memphis, Orlando, New Orleans, etc...San Francisco? Hmmm, all of us healthy foodies would drive him outta town :-)"""""""
3	It is now called Tariq they just changed the name.  I went for a late lunch early dinner and had the Chicken Baryanni.  It was really good and the portion size was huge.  I took home a good amount and left stuffed.  My total meal was $8 and for the portion size it was well worth it.  The only reason it didn't get a better rating is the inside isn't too nice and the wait was a few minutes before I even got a menu.  I will order out from now on.  I also didn't get to try the goat that I went there for as they only do that at night during dinner time.  I will be back for that as the food I had was great.  The waiter said they are going to change the inside and even add a late night window.
4	So if you know me you know I love beer! I really wish I was one of those people that hated beer sometimes but Dear God I love beer!! I think its in my genetic code to love beer from both sides of my family. I'll admit if it wasnt for the beer I'd probably never come here but kids eat free on Mon & Tues. that means what??? You guessed it more BEER for ME!!! I did the beer sampler and fyi the tea here is a ripoff just drink beer. BEER ONLY!!! Got it???!?! \n\nI had the NEW Mahi Tacos: Chile grilled they are wrapped in soft white corn tortillas with homemade pineapple slaw and fresh cilantro. Served with black beans, ancho chile rice and fresh pico de gallo.  -- My only gripe was the corn tortillas they tasted like paper but the rest was pretty delicous I was upset I couldn't eat all three tacos. You could easily share this plate between two gal pals! \n\nKid made her own pizza and what kid doesn't like making pizza?!?!?! Nuff said...\n\nOh yes did I mention I like the beer here!?!?!
3	"""I'm surprised people hate this location so much. Maybe I just haven't experienced the same problems as everyone else. In fact, I've experienced the opposite: what I order is what I get and the staff is friendly and efficient. I've been especially impressed by the manager on duty on weekday mornings - he seems to keep things moving and pitches in wherever he's needed. \n\nI experienced a great example of this attentiveness a few weeks ago when I made a commitment to bring coffee into an 8am meeting but stupidly only left myself 15 minutes to stop and get it. I first went into Starbucks next door and was told it would take at least 15 minutes to get a carafe filled. I quickly ran next door to Einstein's to see if I would have better luck, and to my great relief, the on-duty manager saw that I was in a hurry and told me he'd \get it done.\"""" About 6-7 minutes later, after true hustling, he gave me the full carafe and all of the cups, creamers, etc. \n\nAnyway, it's possible management has changed since a lot of these reviews because my experiences have really been pretty positive. \n\nP.S. Try the asparagus egg breakfast sandwich on the thin wheat bagel. It's a great vegetarian option. Just ask for light sauce."""""""
5	This restaurant was amazing. The service was pretty good. A little forced with their manners and courtesy but they tried and were attentive. Very young and maybe even a little inexperienced staff. However; the food made up for anything that could be construde as a negative! The atmosphere was also nice. A little too bright inside I thought. We ordered based on the waiter's recommendation, the lobster tempura which was $68 but so delicious!! Presentation was incredible on everything. The tempura asparagus was a great compliment to our beef entrees. My friend ordered the Japanese Wagyu meat which is highly exclusive and was priced at $10 and oz. So amazing though we both had some and thought it was worth it! They served it with two salt dishes, a black lava salt and white truffle and they accented the flavor perfectly. I ordered the filet that came with a chili ginger sauce. Also delicious! The meal was amazing, presentation and serveware was beautiful. Their wine list really surprised us. We did have to correct the bill at the end as they charged us $130 for a bottle of Roar which was featured on the menu for $90. This would be a place you could take your girlfriend for her birthday or someone you want to really impress. Best Japanese food I've ever had, hands down!
2	"""I don't get why there is always a line to get into this place. The word \junk\"""" is in the title... and it lives up to its namesake.\n\nI've only ever been here to meet up with friends at night - and it's definitely not a place I would choose to go to on my own. The layout is weird - I've I dig the patio, but to have the VIP seating smack dab in the middle of the room and right where you walk in causes a lot of crowding by the entrance. And then the dance floor is always hard to get to when the place is filled. But I don't think I'd want to hang out there anyway - there's always some slightly overweight and drably dressed women dancing up on the platform. I'm in no way considering myself dance club elite or a Scottsdale Snob, but I go out in Scottsdale as opposed to Tempe because I've grown out of that college kid scene, but I guess Scottsdale still thinks it's cool.\n\nAs for the drinks, nothing special. Although I found it strange that they used plastic party cups when serving pitchers of beer. This place reeks of the shoddy clubs you can find on Mill during the semester. There are definitely better places to go in Old Town. I think AJ's attempt at trashy glamour just comes off trashy."""""""
4	This is a cool place. I would love it if I lived near by it would be my favorite place to belly up. Oh to dream as I live in suburbia, sigh. We walked in one of the many doors and find ourselves in a dark skinny bar with many open two tops and a full four top. Yes, we are with our boys so we need four top. The (I believe) manager said sit where ever you would like. I asked are there more tables? He motions around the bend of the bar. We walk around and into a restaurant with HUGE tables with church pews for seats. Obviously not from a Catholic church as they were comfortable. \n\nWe grabbed a table and spread out. The waiter was great, showed up right away with menus, made beer suggestions and brought them quickly. We perused to the menus, a lot to choose from! I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala pasty, husband ordered the vegan pasty selection, kid 1 ordered Chicken Alfredo (it had bacon) pasty and kid 2 ordered Potato Leek soup with fresh bread. My husband and kid 1 devoured every bit and loved it. I could only eat half and enjoyed it. Kid 2 loved the bread and ate some of the soup, it was delish but not for him (blue cheese). \n\nI think I need to go back and get something different. It was good but I just think it had potential to be great. I might try something more traditional or go for the carne adovada pasty.  Overall it was a great experience. The decor and atmosphere was great (great hangover bar as very dark), service was perfect and food very, very good.
5	My wife, my son and I had a FANTASTIC lunch today at Italian Restaurant.  My wife and I are Brooklyn born and raised and It DEFINITELY met our New York City expectations.  The prosciutto was EXCELLENT, the homemade mozzarella  was to die for, and the flour less chocolate cake was the best we had ever had.   The bread reminded me of what I used to eat at the famous Carolina Restaurant in Coney Island when I was a kid. I give this place 5 stars and highly recommend it!
1	Our waiter smelled horrible! It wasn't even that busy where I could understand him having B.O. We orded soup and mac and cheese for our dinner. Im not a big fan of the steaks from here. Its hit or miss and id rather not risk a miss and end up with a steak that isnt tender. We could tell right away that our waiter had an attitude after we ordered. We werent very hungry and i was craving the mac and cheese. It is a kids dish but i would order it if they raised the price and made it a dish on the menu. Its so good when they dont make it watery, which they did this time. We had to wait almost 10 minutes after we ordered for our bread and for my drink. After we got our food our waiter never Checked on us. He walked by a dozen times but no refills and no more bread. There was also a small fly buzzing around and a Tiny gnat on our table. When we got our check there was a charge for 2 drinks we did not order! I was furious at that point. When I told the waiter he didn't even seem surprised but rather almost annoyed! I get that our bill was not going to be huge but it doesn't mean our service has to be so bad. Whenever I split a dish or order small items as my entree I always leave a good tip. The bill usually comes out to about $20 like this time and normally I would have tipped $5-6 if the service was good or even decent. I just can't believe he thought he could add onto our bill and get away with it!
5	This is the closest, newest major gym to ASU. Five stars for that alone... but there's more!\n\nI've been working out here for more than a year now, and I LOVE IT! Having been a member with the chain for more than 10 years and having gone to about 10 or so different locations around the country, I have to say this is my favorite location of them all, and not just for its spaciousness.\n\nYeah, it's one year new, so of course the equipment and amenities such as the free weights, pool and basketball court are top-of-the-line compared to other 24 Hour Fitness locations. Ellipticals and other cardio equipment are plentiful and modern.\n\nRegarding the chain itself: it's not Crunch, Golds or any of the more fancy chains, but it is accessible to the average joe and more national -- which is important if you like to work out when you travel.\n\nThe classes are average, but the Mesa location gets MAJOR points for scoring a few appearances from local Ali Vincent (winner of The Biggest Loser) to co-teach a boot camp.\n\nAnd did I mention the ASU crowd that frequents this location??
3	I've always been on the fence about Mimi's.  I used to hate the place.. why? I have no idea.  I think I came here and had a turkey sandwhich that was dryer than the arizona desert.  That's it..  \n\nThe last few times I've been to a Mimi's they have been pretty damn good.  They have a huge variety of food to choose from so whatever you feel like, you can pretty much get.  I love the bread that they give out.  they have weird bread that is sweet that I cant think of the name, and it's just amazing.  \n\nI hear their breakfast is awesome, but I have yet to try it.  I will look foward to it next time!\n\nWhy three stars?  Im judging this location.  It was still a Mimi's, but didnt have the feel like the others do.  Seemed more alone and secluded and not many people were there.   Plus.. not to be a stickler, but it's in the dying Metrocenter lot..  yeah yeah.. \n\nMy favorite Mimi's are Chandler/101 and Ray/48thSt.

4	Always a good time bowling here. From the outside, it's a bit rundown and the neighborhood is a bit older as well, but the inside is clean, bright, and welcoming. The snack bar needs help as the last couple of times we went, the cook was ridiculously slow. We just wanted cheese sticks and it took 45 minutes...and there were only 4 other lanes being used at the time! \n\nAll in all, good family fun with great offers if you sign up for their email list and friend them on Facebook!
5	4.5\nWhat hasn't been said yet?!\nParking can be a pain sometimes. Careful not to be towed.\nDefinitely NOT a beer drinker, in fact I don't drink alcohol AT ALL, but I had a sip of my friend's beer and it wasn't bad! I think it was the Hop Not, citrus-y. I wouldn't ever order a whole glass for myself though...\n\nSo why do I come here if I don't drink? \n1.) What ASU student doesn't go to Four Peaks at least once? \n2.) All my friends drink. They are fortunate that I don't drink, so I am always DD. \n3.) Their 5 layer nachos WITH blackened chicken. SO GOOD. Warning, this monster can feed maybe up to 4 people. I came here last week and ordered the nachos. It took so long for us (3) to finish the nachos that I had to ask the server to reheat it. They did so with no problem. \n4) Cool atmosphere. \n\nNo complaints about the heat, swamp cooler, sweating balls, etc. \n\nThey're also opening up a second place off Broadway and Rural, but I'll stick to the original place.\n:]
4	Love this place! Great crowd, great food, and the best part- 1/2 price bottles of wine on Sunday! The Uptown location is probably my favorite, but possibly just because it's closer to home (16th St and Bethany Home). Wait staff is attentive and friendly. Outdoor patio is great when weather permits, and if you can't get an outside table, the doors open almost all the way up, so get a table on the border and you can still enjoy it!
4	I rented a car at the Hertz on West Indian School Road at the end of September. I picked this location because it was just a block from a light rail station, which made it easy to reach from the airport. Car rental rates on the airport premises are stratospheric!\n\nI checked in online the day before and arrived without incident. The only tricky part of this rental location is its location--in a trailer behind a car dealership rather than on the street. Turns out it's easier to access the trailer from the light rail station by walking south along 2nd Avenue instead of going all the way around the building on 3rd Avenue. Live and learn.\n\nAlthough staffed by just one person, I was signed in and on the road in five minutes flat. I rented a mid-size car and was given a 2010 Toyota Corolla with 1,300 miles on it and a full tank of gas. I'm not sure why Hertz thinks a Corolla is a mid-size car, but considering it was just me traveling, I welcomed the excellent fuel economy and new car smell. Turns out I wouldn't want to buy myself a Corolla, but it worked well enough for my four days on the road.\n\nCar return was a cinch. Dropped off the car a little before my scheduled arrival and was signed out and on my way back to the airport in no time. Car rental success!
1	"""I can't believe there aren't 100 other reviews on here! This place was THE WORST! I will not return here nor will I reccomend it! I walked it with 2 bags full.

I can get more out of it that way!\"""" I stayed to wait it out. Big mistake! The lady left with her stuff. The 2 employees didn't even acknowledge me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4	Ate here from a Groupon!   This place lets you build whatever you want on a burger practically.  The order sheet is huge.  It's a great concept as long as you can be decisive haha.\n\nI had a Bacon Cheeseburger with BBQ sauce on the amazing brioche bun and it was great.  The french fries we ordered were half sweet potato/half regular and they were awesome.\n\nSpeaking of which....they have a dipping sauce with the sweet potato fries that is made out of marshmallow and together it's like candied yams on Thanksgiving.\n\nAll in all this is a pretty good burger joint :)
4	"""Dear World,\n\nYou know the drill. It's lunch time. You are hungry. You don't know what you want or where you want it. You don't go to sites like google or yahoo. You go to Yelp.

3	Side Door, West on Hayde, a small location that does it right. \n If you respect the Chicago area you will recognize Vienna beef right away.  \n\nI really enjoy the italian beef at this location, its hard to find a place that serves Italian Beef (see Defalcos Scottsdale Rd).  Bianca was our server and was very helpful for my first time, at the restaurant. If you live in the area check this place out for a quick bite to eat.  \n\nWhere are all the other reviews?
3	It took me a long time to find a great Mexican Restaurant in Scottsdale, so I was very excited to find Frank and Lupe's!   The chips and salsa (one of my favorite parts of the meal) are delicious and I have been satisfied with them every visit.  I also have never been disappointed in the food.  \nI have to agree with some previous reviews that the service is terrible.  At times it seems like you need to beg to even eat there and they are never friendly to the customers!  Improved service would make this a 5 star review!
1	I am just graduated from ASU and I have avoided mill avenue like the plague, unless it was at night. Why would I pay ALOT of money, just to park where my car isn't even watched, just to get hassled by homeless and begged for spare change by drug addicts. I feel like Im in an episode of walking dead when I am on this street. Not only are there homeless and pieces of trash lingering and begging, there is literally trash everywhere and everything is dirty. If you are a guy, the only store for you is urban outfitters so the shopping also sucks.  I have no problem making the drive to scottsdale where you don't pay to park, theres no homeless, and the only drugs users than affect you are the roid monkies.
5	If you're thinking...mmmm I'm craving Pei Wei, go here instead.  It's in the same plaza (this place was there first), you get larger portions, same price, but the food is just WAY better.  The owner is usually present, and is a great guy.  My favorite is the dandan noodles (blows Chang's version out of the water).  The sesame chicken is good, the appetizer sampler plate is more than enough food as well.  Honestly, I stopped going to Pei Wei after I found this place.
3	Came by for brunch after spending the morning at the Women's Expo. \nI'm not sure if the place was new OR if maybe they were trying to save on their electric bill, but the room they put us in did not have the a/c on,,,,, in September, in Phoenix, what the heck? \n\nThe food was OK. We had artichoke dip to start & then I had the 2 egg break meal (eggs, potatoes, toast). None of it was bad, but my taste buds did not dance. They had Mimosas & Bloody Marys for $2 so I had a Mimosa. I got what I deserved for $2 I guess, lol \n\nCentrally located, plenty of parking, shopping & entertainment.
3	On a recent visit to Arizona, my mother and I ventured into this store. Neither of us had stepped foot in it before, even though she lives a mile away. \n\nThe aisles are broken out by cuisine, and the selection was awesome.  I was particularly surprised by the Holland, Dutch, Brazilian, and British aisle, in market classified as Asian. Very unexpected. I bet they would be more business if they boasted to be more international. \n\nI really liked this place, but the word needs to get out about Lee Lee's.  If more people shop, they will restock their shelves more often, and most items won't be so close to their expiration date. \n\nFinal points:\n- check expiration dates before purchasing\n- Generally clean but the shelved items needed to be dusted and straightened, especially the aisle with dishes. They were all over the place and had to hunt for matching bowls.  It's a market, not a dollar store\n- If you can get past the initial fish smell, you won't be disappointed.
3	"""Not being from Scottsdale, Arizona or even the Southwest, I'm not entirely sure how I ended up all the way out at this joint or how where this place is still qualifies as Scottsdale.  A girl said \Meet me here\"""" and like a good boy with nothing but the best of intentions, I complied.\n\nNonetheless, the food is very decent, and I would recommend that you ask for a side of the hot green sauce, which is entirely constituted from peppers with the same name as the restaurant.  It adds a lot.  \n\nIf this place were a planet in our solar system and Phoenix was the sun, you'd be dining on Neptune, but if you happen to be out this way and don't know any better, you'll be happy."""""""
5	"""Hello Chelsea!  Yep one of my \aces\""""  \n\nI love Chelsea's Kitchen complimentary valet and boom you're in the mix.  The smell from the outside draws you in while you approach a cute little patio; great especially during the cooler weather.  Not to worry if it's full, cause just around the back they have a nice sized outdoor patio where sits a firewood place.  X-mas lights hanging from the trees while you gaze into the fireplace, I need a snuggie please!\n\nMimosa? Why yes, Chelsea's also serve brunch, but why not stay for dinner too.   I love their tacos!  I've had several servings plus their burgers are great too!  Go for the Green Chile Burger -- some kick, but not too shabby.  As for the Tacos, go for the Short Rib tacos...man the smell and taste - me likes guacamole!  \n\nService was great!  Always with smile and drinks are a must.  Some mimosa, wine or beer; it's a delight. - Enjoy!"""""""
5	Might as well add to the positive reviews for this place!  Richardson's is a beautiful little restaurant off the beaten path.  We were seated in a corner booth surrounded by tea light candles that gave a lovely southwest vibe.  \n\nThe food was amazing.  We started with the roasted garlic appetizer, which the waitress recommended.  This distinctive dish is served on a large plate with gigantic whole roasted garlic cloves on one side and sauteed peppers, mushrooms, and rich melted cheeses on the other.  Spread all this stuff on the accompanying toast and you're in garlic heaven.\n\nFor my main course I had the New Mexican Platter, which is  big enough for two hungry people to share.  You get your choice of tamale, chile relleno, and a chicken burro.  The mushrooms in the tamale were on the chewy side but all in all the dish was excellent.  The rice and beans were deliciously seasoned.  \n\nThere's a great selection of Mexican and decent happy hour prices.  They also serve brunch.  I'll definitely be back.
4	"""I popped in here after walking around downtown, and the smell was amazing.  I was already hungry walking in, but the smell practically had me foaming at the mouth.\n\nI sat down & had a drink (non-alcoholic because it was a work day) in minutes, and my food arrived 15 minutes later.  The server was super friendly with lots of suggestions & tips.  She recommended a dish , and I had the fish specialty (escoviche?).  It was super!  I got the impression that the jerk chicken is very spicy, but with this dish the \eater\"""" (me) can control the heat, since it's served with chiles and chile oil on the side.  I ended up going all in with the chiles.  Yum city!\n\nI definitely want to go back and try some of the spicier food & have a cocktail as well.  It seemed like they have a small, but great selection of fresh juices and tasty rums to go well with the cuisine.\n\nAs a side note for anyone looking to go here.  It's in a great little spot of PHX, surrounded by other restaurants, and it is close to the light rail (for the lucky few who happen to live off that awesome 17-mile stretch of public transportation).  If you go, note that the place is tiny!!!  It seats maybe 20 people tops, but I think that quaintness adds to its charm."""""""
4	Tricks has made a name for itself based on quality dishes and prime date-night atmosphere. I came for my first visit during happy hour on a Thursday with a group of coworkers. We sat at a table near the outdoor bar and I positively love the patio. What a gorgeous view. It has a lovely feeling about it, and it's relaxed. For happy hour, they have a drink menu with some exquisite, albeit, pricey choices. I chose a Frisky Squirrel or something of a similar silly name and it definitely boasts a tasty, fresh ginger flavor. \n\nWe also ordered some bites from the 4-6 p.m. Monday-Saturday menu: pizza with fennel sausage (for $3 more), chicken wings, bruschetta with goat cheese, and mussels. HOLY MACKEREL, the mussels came in a scrumptious broth that we all fought after-- there was a tomato, fishy, sodium-licious broth that they came in and we dunked our extra pieces of bread in it until the bowl was dry.  The bruschetta? Perfectly acceptable. The pizza? I have some qualms. I could have made this pizza myself. There was nothing special about it-- the sausage was baked in the cheese on top of the pizza, which would make Bianco cringe, and drowned the fennel flavor in cheese and tomatoes. Meh. The chicken wings were the perfect mix of baked and flavorful goodness. I highly recommend ordering these. \n\nI would come back for a nice date or a happy hour again and I am really excited to finally enjoy this Tempe gem.
2	"""We went when it first opened up a few years back, then again in November 2010.....definite change in atmosphere.  Although the food was very good, the service was mediocre at best, the server really had a \no care\"""" attitude.  We had to ask for place settings, then our food came out before our appetizers which was very disappointing.  This could be a sign of the times and the business may be circling the drain.  Worth a try though, the food is very good."""""""
4	"""What a nice little \gem of a restaurant\"""" to answer our craving for Asian  food!  Thanks Yelpers!!!  The food and service at this place are China-licious!  The prices are just $, a bargain!\n\nThe Dragon Palace is tucked away in the corner of an older strip center on the east side of N 32rd just north of E Thunderbird.  It looks like it's been here for years, and I mean a lot of years...  But don't let deter you from trying the Dragon Palace!\n\nRestaurant~ the decor is old.  It's is a thrown back into the late seventies and early eighties with huge red vinyl booths with the high backs.  The walls are solid blue (I guess as a contrast maybe?) with some Asian inspired borders and prints.  They have those old Asian lamps hanging for the ceiling.  Although this place is a through back into time of another era, the place is very clean and comfy.  \n\nService~ excellent from when you enter their restaurant until you leave.  5 star service.\n\nFood~ all of their lunch meals come with water and hot tea, complimentary.  They also offer the usual beverage choices if you so desire something else.  The hot tea was very good!  \n\nTheir menu is also a through back to old Asian restaurants I used to go to when I was a kid.  I remember when mom would say \""""we are going to go and eat Chinese\"""" and I would say \""""mom, we're not cannibals do you mean Asian or Chinese food?\""""  \n\nAfter a slap on the back of the head we were off ~ ready to get stuffed since they always brought you way too much food.\n\nAll of their lunch meals here at the Dragon Palace come with a very tasty bowl of egg drop soup (thick and tasty!), wontons, egg roles, rice is fried or steamed  and the main entree.  We had their Beef with Broccoli and their Mongolian Beef.  Both dishes were China-licious!!  Our entire meal was less than $20 with the tip!\n\nI'm looking forward to going \""""Back in Time\"""" at he Dragon Palace again real soon.  Hopefully I will see you there."""""""
4	Rand has pulled me into his buffet madness!  \n\nI plugged in the address on my GPS and off I went.  I have been on this side of town before but it had been a while.  I don't know about everyone's GPS system but mine told me I had arrived at my destination about .5 miles before I actually had and there was a house there.  I kept going and pulled into the first strip mall I saw on my left.  Viola!  There was Happy Buffet!  It is located near a Native New Yorker, a Fresh and Easy, and a 99 Cents Store.  \n\nI walked in and found Rand and Mike C. chowing down.  Our server came right over and took my drink order and I went to check out the buffet.  The first thing that struck me was that the buffett dishes did not have tons of food in them.  There was plenty, don't get me wrong, but nicely presented and very fresh.  They had all the standard fare, fried rice, chow mein, BBQ chicken, spring rolls and won tons. The spring rolls were a bit greasy but everything else was good. Nicely cooked string beans and Egg Foo Young were probably my favorites as well as the fried rice.  They also had a lovely fruit buffet with fresh strawberries and watermelon.  A nice array of sweet treats was also layed out.  My particular favorite was a tiny cream puff that was fresh and soft with a hint of lemon.  \n\nThere were only a handful of diners when we were there.  The buffet area was kept neat and clean.  The dining room is large with beautiful chandaliers and the ceiling is very interesting.  I'm not sure how to describe it but I thought it was nice and a notch above most buffet places.  If I am ever out in this neck of the woods and have a craving for buffet, Happy Buffet will be my stop.
3	Cute & Cozy little place to get Taco's downtown. The Urban location is creatively decorated with a spanish flare. It is very small inside however there is outside seating. They have a full menu including a variety of Chips, Tacos, Torta's and other specialties. Drink menu for those of you who like a little liquor in your lives. \n\nI tried two Chicken Taco's I will be honest they were ok. I am from here and have had good Taco's so I am picky. The taco's meat was kinda bland though they were garnished with fresh cabbage, carrots, radishes, green onion and cilantro. My taco's were fairly price for $2.50 each. Neatly wrapped in foil. They provide a full service salsa bar. Chips are sold separately. The food is cooked fresh to order and served fast. It is a nice concept with a friendly staff.
3	This location is pretty small and rarely ever stocked, but when it is, it's great. Unfortunately, it's not stocked on more occasions when I visit then it is stocked. Also, now that the Fashion Square location has been remodeled and turned into something close to Heaven, this store has a lot to live up to and doesn't stand a chance unless it gets a complete makeover.\n\nStaff can be hard to find, but once found are generally more than happy to help you with any questions you might have. One of the tricky parts of this store is checking out. There are two checkout counters that aren't visible to each other. One in the lingerie section and the other in the their body/scent shop. You might end up waiting at one for several minutes before venturing over to see if their are employees at the other counter checking people out, grr.
5	I used them for my move on Saturday, 3/17/12 from the Kierland area of North Scottsdale to Old Town. They were perfect!\n\nI'm very demanding and did a lot of research before I picked my movers.\nThe price was competitive (3 hr for $195 out-the-door), and included all packing materials, truck, etc.\nIt was supposed to be 2 movers, and I got 2 plus a supervisor. So it was really 3 guys.\nThey showed up on time and worked efficiently.\nThey were very careful with my furniture and didn't damage a thing. The only item I was worried about is a big black leather couch, and they handled it carefully with no damage or scratches!\n\nI always look to Yelp and do my due diligence when selecting service providers, such as movers, and these guys were great! I highly recommend them and would use them again.\n\nThey also accept credit cards. I paid with a Visa.
2	"""Some friends and I went to see \She's Out Of My League\"""" during prime viewing hours so one would think that they'd at the very least devote a large theater for a popular just released movie on a Saturday night at 9 PM. We ended up in the smallest theater I've ever stepped foot in. A glorified home theater. Of course because of the conditions I previously mentioned it was uncomfortably packed, very obvious they oversold because every seat was filled and yet people were standing. The only seats we could find were up in the front where you had to nearly break your neck so that you could see the screen.\n\nJust a poor layout and poor scheduling. Of course movie theaters are always a pretty standard experience where ever you go, but the management here needs to put some more thought and consideration into their actions."""""""
5	I love this place so much, the staff sets the bar for customer service. I used to work at a hotel and I wanted to bring my jackass staff to see how its done. I have been going here  since Feb. '12 and have lost 50 lbs (its not a miracle program though, you have to do the work and its not always easy) They also have a ton of other goods and services available. The skin products they sell have been my saving grace as well. I have been in once a week for quite some time and not one time has been a bad experience. The facility is beautiful and clean, they have flexible hours and you even get a free vitamin shot if you refer someone or fill out their survey. I am one very satisfied customer and will come here even after I reach my goal weight for the other services they offer.
5	fan-tastic!  every time o go to the rokerij, it gets better. definitely THE most solid restaurant in phoenix in my eyes. the carne adovada is THE SHIT!  hard to even order different dishes when it's this good...\n\ni prefer eating in the downstairs bar - the place is like a bunker. no at&t service so you can just turn your phone off and kick back. \n\ni can say that the jalape\u00f1o and rokerij benedicts are killer as well. great enchiladas...  i could go on and on.
4	"""I dont know how people know of this place because it is very tucked away in this small airport, you wouldnt think that there was a restaurant here! \n\nAnyway, this is a fun place to go to for breakfast or lunch, kids would love it. You can enjoy good food and look out the window at all the planes too. Maybe even catch some landing or taking off. The staff are all very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is very casual, they have some great plane-related decor that is fun to look at!\n\nOur plan was to go here for breakfast, but our day started past noon so we missed the breakfast menu. Oops. Thats okay, we still got lunch! I had the buffalo chicken salad. Their house dressing is delish. I was aiming for the healthier lunch route but that quickly went down the drain with the delicious cheese soaked bread that came with it! My boyfriend got a wrap of sorts, which looked good too! Two thumbs up for \airport\"""" food, haha!"""""""
4	"""If Berkeley and Santa Monica had sex after an intense Bikram yoga session and then took a long shower, you'd have the Mandala Tea Room. And I mean that in the nicest way possible.\n\nA lot of stereotypes come into mind when you walk into this place: Crunchy vibe. Deep Forest-ish music. At least one thing from India on the wall. Words like \vegan\"""" and \""""elixir\"""" floating around. That said, being where I'm from, I'm used to all this stuff. Except here at Mandala there is no overpowering patchouli smell. Nor roaches tittering about. Success!\n\nWe sat in the corner of the room, leaning back on throw pillows at a low table. Our friendly and warmly welcoming server, who was glowing with health and good cheer probably because she hasn't eaten anything deep fried in a decade, presented us with menus. \n\nI chose a Rooibos Chai (no caffeine).\n\n\""""I'm sorry. We're out.\""""\n\nI then chose another normal-ish tea with no caffeine.\n\n\""""I'm sorry. We're also out of that one.\"""" \n\nSo apparently Mandala has 54 teas and I'm having a good knack of picking out the 4 they don't have in stock. Which was briefly disconcerting. I'm a chai and kawa (green tea) drinker by birth and all this fruity tea business that was left to choose from wasn't all that appealing to me, but I had no choice and ended up going with one. \n\nIt arrived in a French press, and then I noticed a whole bunch were also on sale on a shelf next to me for $30 (talk about clever cross-marketing and insane profit margins - maybe Mandala's not so Berkeley after all). And after a few drops of organic agave nectar, the tea tasted pretty good, I'll admit.\n\nWe also got dessert, which I was initially skeptical about. I got the vegan coconut cake because that meant no worries on the drive home. Esteemed dining companion had raw berry pie, which actually felt and tasted like a gelatinous smoothie. Which sounds pretty nasty, but it was really damn good. Believe me. And so was my cake, surprisingly enough (tasty, not nasty). Now, I'm not turning vegan anytime soon, but I can certainly appreciate when vegan's done well. \n\nWe then relaxed amongst the pillows and hung out for a long while, waxing about life's possibilities while drunkards walked past outside, trying to find Devil's Martini. Ah, the poor souls. Trying to find their nirvana in a pair of fake mamms and the ragas of Usher and T-Pain. But more power to them...\n\nAnyway, where was I? Oh yeah. I noticed that Mandala has free WiFi, which is a  bonus for folks who want to work in a quieter environment. However, the place closes at 9 most nights, which for the laptop WiFi crowd is basically 3 in the afternoon. That, not so great.\n\nBut in the end, as a place so close to some of the most obnoxious places in Scottsdale, I'm amazed Mandala's managed to remain as it is for so long. Definitely recommended for those who like tea (except apparently the teas I want) and a chilled out atmosphere smack in the middle of old town Scottsdale. I don't see myself coming here all too often, because something about spending $5 on hot water with leaves is a little hard for me to reconcile, but Mandala is still quality product.\n\n3.75 stars (round up to 4)"""""""
2	This is not the first time I have been to Salt. This is also not the first time I've experienced BAD bar service at Salt. They are very slow with their service. The manager was not of any help. I complained about the bathrooms being very messy for a scottsdale bar. He blamed it on the amount of customers he had come through after a movie had let out. Well I didn't see anyone and it was a Sunday evening! \n\nThe 1 good thing I'd like to say is, my buffalo chicken spring rolls were very tasty. \n\nGood luck to those venture into Salt! \n\nMay the force be with you!
4	"""1st time here last night (finally). We dined on the \secret\"""" outdoor back patio - thanks to my girls prior F&L experience (which is good, I would have never known it was back there). They have a nice outdoor bar area too. The ambiance was really cool, the menu is extensive, the food and drinks were about perfect.\n\nMinus one star for slow service (I guess that's how it's done in Mexico anyway? take it slow... relax... or maybe I'm the one that should order a corona and slow down?)."""""""
4	Ordered the Navaho Triple Beef Taco To Go for my Dinner a few hours later.  This 3 meat Frybread is a good choice if you would to sample each of the beef options in one meal.    Although my request that the Cold Vegetable items be placed on the side for reheating purposes went ignored, I will try again.  Hopefully, they will get it right as it is a pain picking the lettuce, onions and tomatoes off to reheat when I am ready to eat and it makes a mess of the taco .
4	After last night at CMYE Phoenix City Grille, the husband and I weren't in ANY condition to cook dinner tonight. We started flipping through the Entertainment book to see where we might go for dinner. It has been a long time since we have been and paella sounded damn good for my hangover. We got there around 6pm and was maybe the fourth table there.\n\nI ordered a pina colada and the husband had wine. I really liked the pina colada and the fried calamari that was very tender. No one likes overly chewy calamari. For dinner, I had the paella Valenciana (the typical paella dish, $28) and my husband had the paella Negra (black rice with lobster, calamari, shrimp, chicken, etc, $32). Both dishes were delicious and each were more than enough to split between two people. The next time we go, we would probably split one paella. We were using a BOGO deal, so it made sense to get the two and have dinner for another night. \n\nAs we were wrapping up dinner, the band began playing and shortly thereafter, the flamenco dancer came on. The music and flamenco performance was so great and really added to the experience. By this time, the restaurant was packed and our 3 year old was having a blast trying to dance like the flamenco dancer. After they played their set (30 minutes), the singers and dancer walked around to talk with the patrons. Very cool. \n\nOverall, the drinks were good, food was good, service was good, and so were the musicians. Really great time and looking forward to the next!
2	"""I don't know if it is always this way (one WOULD have to assume it is) but I swear to god they were doing a casting call for the VH1 show \Tool Academy\"""" the night I went here. \n\nAfter waiting in line for twenty minutes and going through a Fort Knox age verification process I walk into the bar and see a gigantic circle five guys deep around a mechanical bull. I threw up in my mouth.

4	This is a hard review to right.  Again, I wish Yelp had 1/2 stars because it this review would really be at 3.5 stars.  I have been to several gyms before (golds, 24 hr fitness, tangible) and the one thing I hated at all of them were the fact that they were always busy with people who seemed to have an intimidating aura.  This place isnt like that.  It is quite big and has pretty decent equipment.  I usually go workout with my trainer (Jesse) around 530 and we always are able to workout with no waiting for having to share machines.  They have a lane pool, jacuzzi and sauna rooms.  It kind of reminds me of the YMCA downtown Tucson.  The only problem that I have with the place is the smell in the men's locker room.  I dont know if it is because they are in the basement and the sewer pipes are old but man does it smell!  The membership is kinda pricey but it is close to my house so that saves on gas right?
4	So you know how when a girl's eyes light up when you say that you are taking her to Nordstrom's? For me, my eyes will light up when you take me to a Cabela's.\n\nCabela's is the Nordstrom for men, at least for men who like outdoor activities.\n\nI've been subscribing to their catalog for quite some time and I always wanted to go to one. Just as I imagined, this place is huge.\n\nI wanted to buy a turkey fryer, hand-turn meat grinder, dehydrator, cast iron skillet, a bow and arrow set, a 18 gauge pump shotgun along with other things. But I ended up just buying a rib rack and some corn bread mix.\n\nI saw the biggest largemouth bass that I have ever seen (and even heard of) in my life so far. It was alive (swimming in the tank) and probably 25 lbs. at the minimum.
4	I've only been to Arcadia Tavern once, but I love the atmosphere.  Tons and tons of TVs...if you are a sports fanatic, this place is totally for you.  There's not a bad seat in the whole joint.  \n\nI ordered the chicken wings and loved that they came grilled.  The wings weren't wimpy, they were nice and plump.  It was a great meal.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I will definitely be back.  Who knows...it might be our Saturday hangout when college football season starts up again.
1	My husband and I really wanted to check out this office because it is the closest to us. We had no problem making the appointment for doctor interview at 7:30 a.m., to meet the doctor and promptly showed up at the time of the appointment just to find out that the doctor was not there. In a brief conversation where we stated that we are going to wait until doctor shows up, we were told that we can't meet with doctor regardless of the appointment. Before we could even react office manager Marry Summers informed us that we cannot talked with other doctors, and what we were told is not true. I have to emphasize that Mary Summers was not nice, apologetic, and empathetic about our situation at all. She just wanted us out of the office. I know that everybody has a bad morning, but she was letting it shine. \nMary continued with this; You were informed wrong, and what I am telling you is how it is; You don't need anybody's name but mine; Other people choose the doctor by reading the bio online; This is my office policy.......on and on and on Mary continued to cut us, and see us on the way out.\n \nMaybe those doctors in the office are nice, but why would I bother going through this office representation when even the doctor were not there for their appointment, and I would not see them even if I would wait.....\n\nTo all of you that still wish to try this office, I really wish you good luck.
4	Gotta support this place!\n\nSure, it is not the very best Chinese buffet. But it's not bad, and these guys took the plunge and rolled back their prices. This is the definition of a good value.\n\nThe variety is decent, maybe a bit smaller than some, but they keep it fresh and the taste is pretty good. They also have the now-expected Mongolian BBQ and a small variety of sushi. Not a lot of surprises, it's the usual Chinese-American fare, but generally fresh and, as I said, cheap. \n\nService was also very good, attentive, friendly and fast. The atmosphere is about what you would expect from an older Chinese buffet. \n\nIf you live in the area please check it out. I hope they are rewarded for lowering their prices.
3	I was eager to give this place a try and headed on out on my day off.\n\nI was sure that there was going to be more on my plate when I ordered the Ruben Pastrami sandwich.  It was rather small....boo....I don't like potato salad or coleslaw, macaroni salad or stuff like that but I also don't like potato chips!  I was disappointed there was no fries. I ordered the Cole Slaw since I don't hate it *as much* as potato salad.  Well, hmm...it was OK.\n\nI had the cherry lime egg creme. It was OK too...I'm used to it with ice in it though.\n\nThe Chocolate malt was...lacking malt.\n\nThe good side of all this was the antiques!  Wow, what a great cute place for antiques! A little over priced but fund just the same.\n\nI'll go back but only to look at the antiques and maybe try some different sodas.
4	Over a period of 6 years I took 4 dogs and 2 cats here for various check-ups, ailments and boarding, and never once had a bad experience. The lab technicians are always friendly and and they almost always remember my animals by name the moment I walk in (the animals, not me - they have no idea who I am).\n\nThe doctors are extremely knowledgable. My first visit there, actually - I took my dear old friend and terrier Salinger in about a skin condition that 3 other vets across the valley had unsuccessfully and expensively attempted to treat. Dr. Mott was able to isolate the cause during the first exam (no additional tests required!).\n\nWhile I've met most of the doctors on staff, Dr. Mott is definitely my favorite. On the so very sad day I had to lay my buddy Salinger to rest following a wicked battle with the big C (he was a warrior, he really was), Dr. Mott and one of the lab techs actually drove all the way out to my house in Chandler so that he would be in a calm peaceful place. Thank you Dr. Mott! I can't tell you how much that meant to me and Sal.\n\nThey truly love animals here - if you live in Ahwatukee they're perfectly located - but also not too far from West Chandler or South Tempe.
5	Yogurtland has moved into the #1 spot that I go for tart yogurt. I have basically had every one within a 3 mile radius of my house. We are at a time that you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a frozen yogurt place. Its basically the new gelato. I'm sure a bunch will fizzle out just like gelato joints did  towards the end of the gelato trend. Yogurtland will be the king snake after all is said and done. The self serve, abundance of choices and toppings can't be beat. The plain tart is usually my 'go to' but I have been known to get the Coconut flavor once in a while and it is amazing! It for sure has the best plain tart yogurt in the valley. The only downside is it is swamped with ASU douches that think they invented the place, but thats expected :)  Excited for the Chandler location to open!
2	Rules. Rules. And more Rules! \nNo cell phones.\nNo incomplete parties.\nNo credit cards. (cash only)\nNo firearms.\nNo outside drinks allowed in.\nNo to go orders on weekends & holidays.\nNo smoking. (which is a city law)\nSo if you can handle all of this, the food is pretty good.\noh yeah... btw.. if you would like to try the blueberry syrup then be prepared to pay $1.75 for a 2 Tbsp. serving of smashed blueberries mixed with pancake syrup... They didn't tell me it was extra and I found it quite disappointing to pay so much for so little.
2	I am in utter disbelief of how IMPOSSIBLE it is to find a store in or near Phoenix with a wide variety of high quality, high end, quilters cotton that is NOT intermingled with tacky 80-90's style theme fabric. While I do give this place kudos for carrying some nice names, Windham, Free Spirit, Michael Miller, Alexander Henry, Amy Butler, they seem to carry just enough of those manufacturers/designers to say that they have them, kwim? I have yet to find a great place that doesn't overdo it in the chintzy 80's style gaudy patterns, and carries a great array of new, modern, and classic designers like Heather Ross, Tanya Whelan, Amy Butler, Denise Schmidt, and maybe some fun Japanese manufacturer's/designers like Nani Iro, or Lecien. Will someone please open a shop like this?? Not all people who sew/quilt/craft are 70 years old and love Mary Englebright!!
4	Very helpful and knowledgable staff. The prices are actually lower than you can find on the web. I wanted to buy a new controller for the irrigation being fed up with my old one. The staff actually listened to my problem and offered to check out the old one to see if it could be fixed. They checked it out an offered a cheaper solution which did not require replacing the whole thing. You can't get this service at home depot.
4	We checked in Thursday. There was a slight problem with our reservation. The computer showed that we booked the room in February and cancelled it 1 day later. Obviously, it was a mistake so for our trouble Marie upgraded us. Sweet:)\n\nI'm sitting in our large room while my husband is sleeping soundly in the comfortable, king size bed. The hotel is clean and more modern than not. \n\nHere are some useful hotel facts:\n* Starbucks is in the lobby (closes early Sat and closed on Sun)\n* Valet parking is $23 per day.\n* The on-site fitness is adequate if you do more cardio than lifting. There is a Gold's Gym about a block away. Show them your keycard and you can use their facility free of charge.\n* Free wifi.\n* Most restaurants in the area close early during the week and close completely on the weekend.\n\nWe are on the 18th floor and fortuantely, we don't have any neighbors or an adjoining door. Other reviewers have mentioned the paper thin walls, guess we got lucky cuz I'm a light sleeper and that would really annoy me.\n\nOverall, pleasant experience and I'd stay here again.
4	Last evening was my second time eating here.  Both times I was there for the Sunnyslope art walk.  The first rime I had papusas and this time I had onion chicken and a horchata.  The chicken was fork tender.  I thought they were pretty good with service considering the crowds. I have had the pleasure of sitting with several Yelpers each time and I don't think any one of them ever complained about the taste of the food which is pretty good as Salvadoran food is not near as common as Mexican.
4	"""The food was good here, the pancakes were fluffy and delicious.  I ordered the bacon pancakes and ate them with Tabasco sauce, instead of syrup.  It was a little different having salty instead of sweet on the pancakes but it worked.\n\nService was not so great here, we had a little bit of a wait outside, not a big deal, but the waitress that served us wasn't so attentive to our needs.  She didn't seem to care much about what we wanted and offered no suggestions, maybe she was just having a bad day...\n\nOverall this place is a hidden gem, not near as good as other \Original Pancake House\"""" restaurants, namely the one in Ohio, where the diner experience was great and the staff were friendly.\n\nNote: No credit cards accepted here, cash only."""""""
4	Royal Coffee Bar is another one of the Phoenix area's independent coffee shops and it doesn't disappoint.  Located in a very obscure part of Downtown (across from the County Jail...not that I ever spent a night there for Jaywalking or anything...that was in Tempe), Royal Coffee is a great little place to get away from the mainstream scene to enjoy a great espresso.  \n\nFrom the instant I hit the oddly shaped entrance that surely would make Willy Wonka proud, I realized I was going to like Royal Coffee.  The barista looked as though she thoroughly enjoyed her job and took pride in the product she served.  The parking does suck,but the atmosphere inside and the quality of the coffee made up for it.  \n\nThis was a great place for Phoenix OpenCoffee to meet, and I hope we return again. \n\nI live in the East Valley, but Royal Coffee gave me another reason to make my way downtown more often.
3	I've been here a couple of times for lunch. The food is good, a little pricy but decent. I do have to say that when I ordered a couple desserts to take home, an older man bagged it and THREW it at the cash register. HELLO??? I'm going to spend almost 10 bucks on some goodies and you're going to throw it? WOW.\n\nI do have to agree with other Yelpers, they really need to work on customer service and be nice to those who take time out of their day to eat at their restaurant........remember if it's good, you tell a friend, if it's bad, you tell the world.
1	"""What is the hype people????I went here for lunch after seeing all the awesome  reviews, but I was disappointed. First, the menu is very hard to understand (see the pic that someone posted). I ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich and hummus platter. There isn't much of a drink selection in the tiny fridge. For soda, all they had was the cans and they charged $1.00 for them. Later, while I was eating I noticed a lot of people were buying their drinks from the market, then coming over to order their food (pain in the ass if you ask me). Anyhow, so I was only 1 of a few people there and the food took quite a while. When they finally called my order I went up and asked for the \garlic sauce\"""" that I heard so much about on here and the lady said it would cost $1.00. I said nevermind because I wasn't going to pay that for a small container of condiment! I was surprised at how small the sandwich was. It wasn't  impressive either. Just a grilled flatbread with a few pieces of  chicken, a few tomato slices, lettuce, and a little sauce. In my opinion this wasn't worth 3.99, but more worth 2.50 or something because of its size and how little filling there was.The hummus was good, but  nothing spectacular. This place is also in a dodgy part of town right across from project housing...literally right across the street. The market was pretty cool though and I'll prob return (during the daylight of course) for some olives, olive oil, and pita. BUT will skip out on dining here."""""""

5	I love CrackerJax, because it is super fun! I had a strong desire to go to some batting cages, because for some reason, I used to go a lot as a kid when I was living in AZ. Plus, why wouldn't you like it? Or maybe I'm just weird. But, from not even handling a bat in almost 10 years, I wasn't half bad! I apparently was so good, that this little 5 yr old boy started watching me, called his Dad over to watch, told me how impressed he was, and then gave me a high five. Um awesome? Definitely the highlight of the evening. It's kind of sad that I felt so happy about a little kid giving me a high five, but hey, it was pretty cool. We also decided to do the bumper boats, and the go karts. My bf got my Mom and her bf to do the go karts with us, which she wouldn't usually do. Super fun! I was scared to do it, since I haven't even driven a car in 6 years, but it was soooo much fun! We ended up doing it 4 more times.
5	An absolutely awesome little spot tucked away in a stripmall which proves that great food can found in the most unassuming of locations!\n\nThe pizzas are outstanding, most notably the thin crust pies. The sauces are beautifully balanced, the cheeses properly dispersed and the salumis perfectly crisp and juicy. Along with a nice red you cannot go wrong.\n\nOur server was also one of the owners and he was incredibly helpful and friendly. I left feeling like we were long lost friends, and I felt like my dollar and patronage really mattered. \n\nFind this place and you will find a great dining experience. And eventhough it's small, they take kindly to kids, which us a bonus when my son and I have pizza night.

5	My husband surprised me with a visit to this place and boy was it a treat! \n\nI ordered the K8 - Saeng SaeWoo Gui - Shrimp and vegetables and he ordered the K4 - Daeji Bulgogi - spicy pork. Both were the 'BBQ at your own table' type.  \n\nThe aroma of the shrimp and the zucchini roasting in the sauce and changing colors really whets your appetite. The food was light, delicious and just the right quantity without making you feel like heavy. I ordered the Hazelnut coffee with boba. The drink itself was yummy but I didn't care too much for the boba.\n\nThe seating I would say is a little tight but the food and service are excellent. Very well priced too. And I got to enjoy some Korean TV drama as well :)\n\nWe're definitely going back to try a few more dishes!

2	I've always wanted to go here.  The flames outside intrigued me.  So we went on Wednesday night around 8pm.  We were sat fairly quickly with no reservations for habachi.  Music is pumping, and the crowd is a bit older/slightly cougarish.\n\nThe service was...OK. He went missing from time to time.  He brought me a diet coke after I had only taken a few sips out of my glass.  I must of gotten 4 new glasses by the end of the meal.\n\nSoup....is your basic mushroom miso soup.\nSalad...Tasty, spicy, had a nice kick.  Fresh crunchy greens.\nFillet and Chicken....Eh....I found the flavors lacking, the steak a little chewy, and the chicken boring.  Even the dipping sauces were lacking.\n\n74 for dinner plus tip for two.  I think you can get better elsewhere.  Not worth the drive down to Scottsdale, find a local joint closer to home.
4	We decided to celebrate a special occasion here and even though it's a chain (and our preference is for non-chains when possible), we were quite happy with our decision.  The one thing I can say for McCormick and Schmick's it's always consistent wherever you try them across the country.  \n\nThey do have an excellent Happy Hour (which is available in most locations, I have partaken before in it in Seattle and San Diego).  The Happy Hour menu is only available in the bar and at the Phoenix location, the bar is quite nice and spacious (and separate from the main dining room with a more laid-back atmosphere).\n\nFor this review, however, we sat in the main dining room.  I reserved last minute via Open Table and we were given a choice booth at the front windows.  Our group ordered both seafood and steak entries, a few side dishes and deserts to share.  The meal starts with their trademark warm sourdough bread (as good as you get in San Francisco) and on this night (New Years) they were offering complimentary glasses of champagne (nice touch)!  \n\nSome Key Points:  \n*The server.  He was so awesome, made great recommendations, made sure our table was refreshed consistently and all our needs were met. \n*The food, everyone mostly really enjoyed their main courses (prime rib, ahi tuna, crab legs, steak and lobster).  The King Crab was on special and was 1lb and a bit overpriced plus they do not crack it for you (I am spoiled, I love it when places do this for you).  I am told the prime rib was outstanding and a large cut.  The deserts (Cr\u00e8me Brule and Key Lime pie) were OK.  The Key Lime was more like a tart and a little different (would not try it again) but the Cr\u00e8me Brule was excellent.  We also tried the mushroom risotto which is average, the house salad (also average) and the beet salad (very good).  \n*The prices, yes they are on the high side but I am ok with this if the quality is there and I would say it was.\n*Nice atmosphere.
4	LOVE this place. Eat here twice a month at least. Very consistent in quality. I love the pico type salsa with warm chips nice touch!. I always get the stacked enchiladas with extra onions & lettuce. The enchilada sauce is so creamy smooth. Also love their Indian fry bread with beef and green sauce. Fry bread is fluffy yet crispy enough to not be soggy when smothered with the green chili beef!\nThe staff is incredibly polite and kind. I feel like family when I'm there.
1	Over the years this place has experienced a sharp decline from a place people used to want to take their kids for birthday parties and dinner after church on Sunday. It now is mostly crowed by those who are just looking for cheap food and a lot of it. Poncho's used to run commercials stating they were an all you can eat buffet but during my last trip I noticed that the eat all you want spirit had been crushed and thrown out the back door with the trash. \n\nSeriously with as much time as it takes for them to see your little flag on the table and to bring you the food item you requested you will lose intrest or just give up and and hit the taco bell drive through on your way home.\n\nThe server I had did her best to keep up with the huge level of requests she was being given but seemed tired and mad most of the time. Kind of made me wish I could just go up there and just get what I wanted just so she would not have to. That is the way it used to be and I wish they would go back to that policy but they will not because they know you will eat less that way. \n\nThe one thing that would make me even want to step foot in the door would be the basket of chips and salsa they give along with the little pillows of goodness also known as sopapillas that are served with honey. To be honest most kids will still like this place as they do serve food that they like such as tacos and also have a sundae bar with soft serve ice cream and tons of toppings. But if you are like me and do not want to have to suffer for cheap food just skip this place on by.
3	Imagine my dismay when I rolled  up to the ghetto Target on 7th Ave and see it moved to 19th Ave. All righty then. So I fight the traffic/construction/random people in the road/low riders/huge trucks/light rail and go deeper into the West Side. \n\nWest Siiiiiiiiide indeed. I have no idea what that means.\n\nThe mere size of the building and parking lot are impressive. I'm happy with the spacious aisles and great food section. The home section is all right too. The accessories and clothes section is pretty terrible. The Indian Bend/101 Britney Spears Target is much better for non-food items. The store is laid out in a very confusing way but I think I'll get used to it.\n\nOh - one really gross thing: I found a dead BUG - that 's right - a B-U-G in one of the decorative x-mas bags I bought. Ew.\n\nClean up! \n\nOtherwise average.
5	It's dark, it's dank, it's small and it's filled with amazing people who appreciate a good drink, good music and good times! Chars is a place that I had meant to check out for months but never got around to it, but when I did, I had a great time! I love the blues and funk, and it felt great being able to listen to great classic covers and a few new tunes (live and within reach, mind you) while enjoying a beer. I can't wait to get a chance to spend another evening here! I'm definitely telling my friends.
5	I dont know if its the quality of the food, the atmosphere or the great selection of beer here, but Dean and the rest of the people over at the Cornish Pasty Co. know what the hell they're doing! This place is awesome and if you've never been...get off your ass and check it out!\n\nGrowing up in Michigan, the pasty is somewhat of a local food (by way of English immigrants). If you're from northern Michigan, the pasty is nothing new to you. However, the pasties we grew up with are not the pasties they serve here. Dean has taken the idea of the traditional pasty and put a totally high end, almost gourmet twist into the mix. Look for southwestern and Greek flavors as well as traditional English and Italian pasties. The Oggie or O.G. is awesome. Simple, traditional and good. \n\nThe staff is friendly, helpful and colorful! Check out the juke box witch contains mostly, if not all British bands. Just another nice touch.\n\nAhhh a Pasty and a Pint! Life is good.
5	I love living near this place.  I'm a big fan of tapas and have tasted nearly everything on the menu, as well as brunch (which is AMAZING).  A couple of items not to miss are the octopus, the fried anchovies, and the brussles sprouts.  David is also great with his wine selection.  Be sure to ask him for help if you don't know your Spanish varietals.  Don't miss this place if you are in the mood for great food and wonderful decor.  The place is hoppin as well later at night.
3	"""Being a displaced Jersey Shore girl (the year round residents, not the wankers from up north and NY who comprise the cast of the MTV show of the same name)  I have grown up knowing that the best basic seafood comes from little run down looking places, especially fish markets with a few tables outside the front door. I'm not talking about seafood that is done as a form of art such as Eric Ripert executes at Le Bernardin- I'm talking minimal preparation with little more than lemon juice, butter and Old Bay seasoning.  The kind of food you get at the legendary Berkeley Seafood Market in South Seaside Park, or used to get at Spike's market in Point Pleasant before they changed hands and raised prices a decade ago.\n\nI've never been a fan of corporate restaurants, and derisively refer to Red Lobster as the Frog Lobster.  My first experience with Joe's was in Toledo, OH, when they opened up in 1996. Back then they had an overly unctious crab soup my ex was enamored of, and more raw bar offerings.\nOne thing that has been consistent however is the coconut shrimp, and that's why I go there. Unlike most chains and non chains alike that buy the coconut shrimp frozen and pre-breaded, Joe's breads their shrimp to order as fried shrimp should be breaded.  The other thing I order is the Beantown Bake steampot, as it has two \cricket\"""" lobsters as we call them back east plus some steamed littleneck clams just like an old time clambake.  I could care less about the sausage but it's edible, and the shrimp are okay too as are the seasoned potatoes and the half ear of corn. For the price though the lobster and clams shine- here in AZ a person can't go to the supermarket and buy two lobsters for the price that the steampot costs at Joe's ($38.50 less than four weeks ago.)\n\nI confess I don't bother to order any of the fish filets or other items at Joe's, but I will say that they get the straightforward items right- crisp fries, fresh coleslaw without too much vinegar, sugar, salt or mayo and balanced in flavor and I do like the chutney like dip for the coconut shrimp. My bf has been going to Florida for over 60 years and he likes the fried shrimp so it must be decent.  Maybe I'll go there the next time I get a yen for classic fish and chips, but living in Buckeye it's easier to just do that at home.\n\nSo, everything in life being relative, if you're looking for basic fresh seafood prepared simply, eat at Joe's. Anything more elaborate, wait until you're in a town on a coast."""""""

5	My wife and I delayed our birthday dinner (ours are just a couple weeks apart) and finally went last night.  It's been a while since we've been to Fleming's so we were both looking forward to it.\n\nWe had reservations and were seated promptly.  LeAnn was our server and she was awesome.  She recommended the Eponymous Cab.  It was pricey at $20 per glass.  But worth it.  Nice, well balanced cab.\n\nWe started off with the toasted mushroom ravioli.  Delicious.  Filled with tender mushrooms with a butter porcini sauce.  How to get all the sauce?  How about that mini loaf of sourdough they bring you!  \n\nWe both ordered filet.  My wife ordered the porcini crusted filet and I had the main filet.  Both medium.  We ordered the garlic mash and roasted baby carrots.\n\nThe steaks- cooked perfectly.  The manager came over a couple minutes after we cut them to make sure they were to our satisfaction.  They were.  I had a side of peppercorn sauce with mine as well.  Fantastic.\n\nThe sides- the mash was nothing special.  But those carrots?  WOW!  Don't think of grocery store carrots when you think baby carrots.  Not even close.  The carrots were roasted with golden raisins and slivered almonds.  Those could have been the best part of the meal if I wasn't such a steak lover!  \n\nLeAnn gave us a complimentary box of chocolate truffles as well.\n\nThe food was fantastic but the service was above and beyond.  We will definitely be back!
5	The Homewood in Happy Valley rules.\n\n\n My company has an office based in Phoenix and Homewood happy Valley is normally where they put me up since I have to bring my crazy puppy for the extended stays and they allow pets. \n\nThe staff is amazing and put up with so many of my crazy antics over my 2 months stint.  I did my best to keep them on their toes and they gave me a run for my money. \n\nThe rooms were very clean, staff was great, breakfast was always awesome, I only had dinner once or twice and it wasn't too bad.\n\n\nBeing away from home for 2 months working, not knowing anyone or anything was a little intimidating and hard for me but the hotel staff definetly made it easier for me to adjust and would even suggest fun things for me to do.\n\n\nHands down best hotel expierence ever.
5	"""best Chinese food in the valley. I pretty much don't go anywhere else.\n\nI don't really understand what that other reviewer's problem is with the lack of windows? it's not like the place is a dungeon. it's a somewhat dim, peaceful restaurant.\n\nGolden Gate special shrimp with walnuts is one of the most delicious things to eat, ever. their hot & sour soup is bomb. and their fried rice is delightful & not overly, disgustingly greasy. this place is so much better than the myriad of stupid \Chinese\"""" chain restaurants or nasty take-out type places. for realz."""""""
3	"""Ive been to F&H on numerous occasions. The night usually goes a little like this..\n\n  I walk up to the entrance, I see people smoking outside in a small fence area. I look over and see these groups are starring at me like i just blatantly readjusted myself in public.  I give them one more glance and realize in two hours we all will all be best friends exchanging pointless stories about our days when in reality I couldn't give a flying f*[% about their new kitten they adopted and named Bunbun. But in 2 hours I will thrive and cherish each of their stories and be amazed I never found such intellectual people sooner.\n\n Before I get to the door I feel eyes spying on me. I look up to find  one of 17 hostesses peering through the window ready to yank the door open a mere second before I reach for it. (you can't beat them to this..  Ive tried several times, they are good at what they do. Just prepare for this and accept it.) \n\nas I step inside my eyes automatically affix to the bar top. I scan up and down the row of seats. As I'm scanning down I see two empty seats. I'm not sure if guy code applies to bar seats like the bathroom urinals (guys.. You know what I'm talking about)..  But I usually just start the night off not giving a...  Because I already aknowledge the fact things are only going to degrade from here anyways.\n\n I start with a tall miller light and look up at the game playing on the TV's. I continue my beer almost empty then order some beer battered buffalo chicken tenders with extra ranch. I look into the reflection of my phone to make sure my face isn't suddenly disfigured because she looks at me as if I just asked for an order of wine and chive biscottes. \n\nI explain that I am looking to get the beer battered buffalo wings then she calls for backup like I'm speaking a foreign language.  \Hey Lacey! This guy wants beer battered buffalo chicken wings\"""" they say some things, fumble a bit then come back with..  So you want \""""chicken tenders and ranch?\"""".  I explain again to the both of them. They both tilt their heads to the side. Either this one beer slammed me, and I'm speaking nonsense at this point, or they just don't understand what buffalo wings are.   \""""so..you want a cheeseburger and a side of buffalo sauce sir?\"""". They do a little further team planning and come up with a solution and I end up with beer battered chicken tenders dry as a bone with no sauce and a side of buffalo sauce. My friend getting the opposite  when we both ordered the same thing except he gets no buffalo sauce and a side of ranch.. I find it to bother me less and less each time because I expect it now.  \n\nTheir food really is good, and their service is...Did i mention that their food is really good? \n\nI look back up at the TV acting real smooth and care free only to realize ive been watching female tennis on the television next to me for the past 30 minutes while everyone eIse is attentively watching the football game. I'm not ashamed to admit that I continued watching it. I think it was the loud grunts that kept my attention. I finish eating, grab another beer and me and the friend approach the ping pong table. \nYou need to go to the hosts stand to get the equipment. It's free. Wait no it's not..  It's a dollar. Nope that was last month. Now it's 9 bucks an hour. Better empty those pockets. Just remember every hour you waste playing you could have fed 27 starving ethiopians for  a month. But in your drunken stooper you chose to dish out the $9 like myself and play pool or ping pong. Shame on you.\n\nPS.., beware of the twins...  I thought I was loosing my mind after a few beers seeing one girl cover the whole restaurant in a matter of mere seconds. If you ask  your server for something and she looks at you funny...  it's either because you asked her twin, or you asked for buffalo chicken tenders.\nAlso... if you stay late enough the cops hide and wait for you to leave the parking lot as soon as you turn out. But of course you have a designated driver... right?\n\nOverall, the food I have ordered was great.\nThe service was...\n\nthe food was really good."""""""
4	My first Sprinkles experience was in Beverly Hills.  We wait 30 minutes outside before getting in.  I was happy that the wait wasn't long at all in Scottsdale.\n\nWe don't have a Sprinkles in KC so of course that justified getting 4 cupcakes to share with two other friends.  We got the coconut, black & white, red velvet and peanut butter chips.  All of them were fantastic in their own ways.  Each was moist and rich in flavor.  I loved the dark chocolate cupcake in the B&W.  The peanut butter was subtle and not over power and the chocolate butter cream frosting really complimented the cupcake.  Each was rich and I couldn't finish it all.\n\nUnlike another reviewer, I had a great experience with the staff. One staff member answered all of my questions and gave good recommendations. Then the gal behind the register was friendly too. \n\nI have also tried the Red Velvet mix they sell and it turned out just as great as the ones from the shop.  It was very simple and a great way to share Sprinkles with my friends in KC. I certainly recommend it to impress any house guests and when you can't get out to the bakery.
4	They accommodated our big group in the separate dining area to the right of the arcade once you first enter. My friends have raved bout this joint and wanted to try it out. Upon entering the place, you would think it's one of the smaller chain restaurants with greasy pizza (barros). But the food actually surprised me here. \n\nGot the old world salad which was filled with all kinds of goodies like feta cheese, olives, red onioin, peppercinis, roasted peppers, cucumber, etc. I think the best part of the salad was their tomato house dressing which is phenomenal. It has a tangy balsamic taste to it which is awesome with any salad I would imagine. Maybe even dip ur pizza in it.\n\nNext time I gotta try some of their pizzas though and I will report back!
5	My family and friends all love Oregano's. The food is always excellent and the servers are always super friendly. My all-time favorite dish is something that isn't even on the menu anymore but they still make it on request - the Pasta Basta. It's penne pasta, sun-dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, toasted pine nuts and spicy feta. I always ask for a spoonful of pesto right on the top. Y-U-M-M-Y! It's a huge portion so I usually just eat half and get the other half boxed up. It makes for good leftovers the next day.\n\nWe don't usually get dessert at restaurants, but make an exception at Oregano's and always get the pizza cookie. My favorite is half chocolate chip, half white chocolate macadamia nut. I've tried to make it at home but it's just never as good as at Oregano's.\n\nOther things we've had that are excellent: Guacatony, garlic cheese bread, wings, Bistro Classic pizza, baked ziti, Italian sausage sandwich.\n\nAll locations are almost always busy, so expect a bit of a wait. It's well worth it though.
5	I have always liked the Biltmore Fashion Park. I used to live nearby so i have spent a lot of time here.  The stores are always changing as well as the restaurants. Over the years there has been quite a variety. One thing you can always count on here is change. Covered parking in the Garage, valet parking and just regular parking in the back. Lots of chioces!  Saks 5th Ave. has been here for years and is the only one in the Valley. What used to be The Broadway is now Macy's, fabulous!   I miss that there is no Banana Republic here any more, but, always something new. You can walk your  dogs around through here, they have a lot of good events all the time. Even have an Apple store. Good place to walk around on a date as well.
4	"""LUC'S IS CLOSED - WILL REOPEN IN JANUARY 2009 UNDER ANOTHER NAME\n\nBeautiful dining room and presentations, warm and attentive service.\\nJust learned that they lost their chef (Gio Osso) to the Estate House. \n\nThe owners and staff are very welcoming and accommodating, in the sense that they are truly gracious hosts, who don't take their patrons for granted like some other fine dining restaurants. I disagree with some of the other reviews that mention that \""""the food was generally not good.\"""" Luc's is a destination for foodies like myself, who appreciate some unusual yet delicious culinary creations.\n\nI consider Luc's to be one of the best kept secrets in Scottsdale and a worthy competitor to Binkley's restaurant in Cave Creek.\n\nI have a lot of faith in the creative team that is behind Luc's, from the standpoint that that their cuisine is not only very tasty, but dynamic for a contemporary American restaurant. In fact, Luc's is ahead of its time that keeps attracting adventurous diners from all over the valley"""""""
4	Some friends of ours invited us to join them here at Padres on a recent Saturday night to have dinner and see the band (whom were friends of theirs).  Wow, how unexpected the whole experience was.  \n\n*Interesting building, looks like not much from the street but come inside and the atmosphere is hopping.  Yet while busy, the acoustics are good so you can still carry on a conversation with your dining partners and enjoy the band.  \n*Totally mixed crowd (ages, backgrounds, etc.).  \n*Good service.  Our server was very busy but he made it fun, great sense of humor (a little sarcastic but we loved it).  \n*Tiny parking lot in back so be aware as it gets full and is tight.  \n*The band (kind of a jazz quartet type group) was really good and nothing I would ever expect at a Mexican Cantina.  The also have salsa dancing later (on weekend I am told) and some seriously great dancers showed up and were great fun to watch.    \n*Make reservations if it's a weekend especially!  Try to get a table in the main dining room/bar area so you can see the band.  Otherwise you can hear them but not see them if you end up in one of the other rooms.  There is also an outside patio but in August, not for us! \n*Sign up for their email club and you will get some 2 for one's, notices on what is happening there, etc.  \n*Food was really quite good.  I don't think what anyone had was the best Mexican we have had but we were happy with our food and especially loved their creative deserts and delicious Mexican coffee.  It's a little pricey but not over the top.
1	"""This hotel was a big disappointment for two main reasons: the overcrowded, unclean pool overrun with locals; and the service.  We waited in line to enter the pool area and, once in, found empty chairs surrounded by discarded wet towels and garbage. The pool was crowded and warm and the lazy river did not move, giving you plenty of time to rub elbows with everyone else in the pool, including drunk adults and babies in diapers. Definitely not my idea of a \resort\"""" pool experience. \n\nAs for service...we pre-paid two nights here through Priceline. When our flight into Phoenix was delayed due to weather and we got stuck in Chicago, we immediately called the Pointe Hilton to explain the situation and that we would not need our room for the first night. (We also notified Priceline.) After numerous civil conversations with the hotel in the 10 days that followed, they refused to either comp us a room on a different night or give us a refund.  They talked about \""""their system\"""" and \""""their process\"""" but seemed to forget all about \""""the customer.\"""" Not sure if this is standard with all Hilton hotels or if this is just one bad manager at a struggling hotel, but when given the opportunity to do the right thing, the Pointe Hilton did not.  Disappointing for sure.\n\nWe drove out of the hotel parking lot in a rental car covered with bird doo, which pretty much sums up our experience at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak.  We went there, got shit on, and left."""""""
3	So I was meeting some friends here last night for drinks for a friend's birthday. We were supposed to meet at 9:30 but it was around 10:30 when we actually got to the bar. We walked in and had our IDs checked and then stood around awkwardly...I'm not sure why this happened, but after a few minutes we were asked if we needed a table. Yup...that's why we're here. So we were seated near the bar. The place is large and the decor is fine, but the music they were playing was mainly from the 90's and made the place seem less 'hip' I guess, not that I know much about being hip. We waited for about 5 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. The waiter finally came by and took our drink order. I got the agave basil margarita ($8.50) which was soooo good! I was very happy with the drink. The Birthday Girl got a blueberry bliss... which wasn't what she was expecting. I tried it and thought it was good, but it was definitely more like wine than a mixed drink. The others got beers. \n\nSo the real problem, for me at least, was my second drink. I got a tropical margarita ($7.00). It was one of the worst drinks I have ever had and was a challenge to drink. It was SO acidic and just nasty, I swear the two drinks could not have come from the same place...but they did. That's a huge red flag for me.\n\nSide note: Why do restaurants think it's cool to not price their signature drinks....why should I have to ask how much it costs? I find this completely ridiculous and annoying. The drinks didn't end up being very expensive here, but I feel like I should have that information available to me on the menu just like any other item.... *ok steps off soapbox*\n\nAs far as food goes, one of my friends got a side of fries that were pretty good and came with bbq sauce, but other than that we did not eat. I have heard good things about their food from other people. \n\nAfter we were done with our second round of drinks (and the fries) we decided to move on to another bar.....but we couldn't because we had no check! Our waiter, who had been almost harassing us towards the beginning of our night, had completely disappeared. He finally came by like 10-15 minutes later and reeked of cigarettes....there is no way he only smoked one because I could almost taste it...pretty gross for a waiter. Anyway, our checks were brought fairly quickly after that and we were finally able to leave.  \n\nConclusion: Be very careful what you order....it is a total mixed bag.
5	Su Vino is my out of the way, go to spot.  I've brought the girls here, done the whole after work relax thing, gone on multiple double dates, used groupons, not used groupons, planned a private party of 80 here, and a large group of 13.  I continue to go back, and will continue to do so... whether I check in or not.  (Out of the way, remember... don't want to give it away)\n\nYes sometimes the service can be a bit spotty, sometimes it is weird to be the only people in there, and sometimes you'll show up only to find out its not open at that time for something or a-rother. However the service can also be awesome and when you are there for hours shooting the shit; you don't always need a server in your business.  I also have been to known to like it when we have the place practically to ourselves, the crowd varies a lot and my friends and I aren't exactly known as quiet.  And having also rented the spot out for a private surprise engagement party... I'll respect it when they do it for others.\n\nOn that note, highly recommend this venue for a cocktail/mingle event.  The set up of the spot is perfect, tall tables and soft lighting are great for groups.  We had them put out giant boards with their spread of antipasto/cheeses/fruits etc. for everyone to knosh on, and they did a great job keeping them fresh and stocked.  We selected 4 options from their wine menu for the guests to choose from, and the staff was very engaging while pouring and answering questions.  They even made a custom bottle/label for the bride and groom to be.  Su Vino also has a section where you can get all hands on and bottle the wine.   I haven't done it personally, but it looks like a great group activity and a conversation starter at the least. \n\nWhen I go with the girls or in smaller groups I always start off with their taster flight selection for 10 dollars.  It is so much fun trying them out, again and again, with whomever I'm with... and then making by the glass or bottle selections from there.  I recommend their cheese and meat small plates, perfect to share and compliment each other well.  If you don't see the games out, ask.  A rousing round of Boggle or Chess can be a great addition to any evening, and can turn those large tables into justttt the right fit.
4	This is a very high-end type of restaurant, with prices to match.   It is not your typical Italian restaurant, so if you are looking for the standard Italian menu, this is not the place for you.    If you are looking for over-the-top service and a unique dining experience, then you will like this place.    I was caught off-guard when I went here, so had to adjust my expectations.    \n\nMy first impression was the outstanding service of the host, she was exceptionally warm and friendly.     The atmosphere inside is very intimate.    \n\nI was very impressed with the plate of homemade pasta menu options that the waiter brought to show us - but then a little disappointed that the majority had red meat in them.   There was one that worked for me, and it was truly outstanding and tasted homemade and chef-prepared.     \n\nI loved everything about our dining experience from the service to the meal, except compared to the many restaurants I've eaten at, I thought it was over-priced, even for the high-quality of their food.     Loved it, but not enough to go back.   If you are looking for a unique Italian dining experience, maybe for a special occasion, then I highly recommend Marcellinos for you.
3	"""2.5 stars rounded up to 3.\n\nThe wife and I made our way over for Sunday brunch the other morning. It was a beautiful day out on the back patio. We were given a gift certificate by the management, and thought we would enjoy ourselves. \n\nAnd we did....for the most part. Because we weren't technically paying, I can't really be too harsh here. The real shocker was the service. Despite the fact that there were 5 servers cruising around, and they \work as a team\"""", we had difficulty getting anything we ordered in a timely manner and it took at least 2 requests to get any additional items like drinks, napkins, etc. I think the \""""team\"""" aspect really hurts here. I ask one girl for a bloody mary, she disappears. Then I ask another guy for a bloody mary, and a third person brings it to me. Just give me one waiter and call it a day. It seemed much more chaotic this way. Also, the bloody mary was disgusting. I don't know what they put in this thing (a gallon of worsteshire?) but I could not finish it and that's sayin something as I consider myself a bit of a boozehound. \n\nOnto the good. The food was exceptional. I really enjoyed my chilaquiles and while I can't recall what the wife had, I know she really enjoyed it. When our servers were present, they were very friendly and accommodating....when they were present. \n\nWhile I have eaten here a few times, this was my first time on the back patio and it was truly lovely. Again though, the service sucked. Inside is a bit different, and overall I'd say this place is a bit too pricey, but it's a nice time and the food is quite good. \n\nWe weren't able to kill our entire gift certificate, so we'll be back, but at the end of the meal we were kinda dreading our next experience...."""""""
5	It's the perfect place to spend the weekend when the city is hitting 110 degrees.  A totally relaxing and beautiful day on the river.  Plus, the scenery is incredible!  My friends and I were lucky enough to see three different groups of wild horses in addition to countless fish and birds.\n\nCompared to my experiences on the Guadalupe River in Texas, the Salt River (at least on Father's Day) is totally tame.  Sure there were a few drunk and high folks, but everyone behaved themselves.  The water was amazingly clean in my opinion.  And anyone freaking out about pee in the river needs to stop being high maintenance.
4	Love the prices at this place! \n\nWe had the Tofu Sukiyaki, Pan Fried Gyoza,  Banbanji, Yakiniku and Shrimp Curry. My favorite was the Banbanji appetizer. Although the flavor of all the dishes weren't out of this world, they were still good. \n\nThe portions were just right, 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes perfectly satisfy a dinner for 2. The service was very good and timely. Next time I go back , it will probably be one of the ramen bowls on the table.
4	Some say that C-Fu has the best Chinese food in the Phoenix area, I disagree. I'd say that C-Fu is definitely above average, but not the best. \n\nIt's definitely worth a trip, especially during lunch when they serve dim sum.\n\nC-Fu  not only has the standard menu items such as Sweet and Sour Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Chow Mein, but they also have some unique items such as Shark Fin Soup, several duck and ostrich dishes, and sea cucumber dishes.\n\nAbove average taste coupled with good dim sum gives C-Fu an above average rating of four stars.
4	A friend and I had lunch at The Herb Box today after checking out the reviews on Yelp.  The restaurant is charming and located in the beautiful DC Ranch area. \n\nWe sat on the patio which was nicely cooled with misters. Our service was very good.  It was a Sunday afternoon and there was a good crowd but we were greeted and served promptly. Our waitress checked on us regularly and we always had our tea and water glasses filled (which I think is always a sign of good service).\n\nI had the Coconut Shrimp Salad and my friend had the Butternut Squash Enchiladas. We both enjoyed our meals. My salad had a lot of flavor and was very fresh. The presentation of the food was beautiful, too.\n\nThe menu is diverse but a little pricier than a typical lunch. However, the food and atmosphere was worth it. \n\nWill definitely be back.
5	Had dinner the other night with 2 friends. Mondays are all day happy hour which means draft beers $2.50, house chardonnay or zinfandel $4, and liquor is half price.\nWe ordered a bowl of hose marinated olives to start for $3 and were afraid we were going to get, like, 4 olives. Nope! It was a nice portion size! and they were delicious too. A little spicy with lemon zest...\nThen we ordered the roast beef with horseradish, the RB&C I think it was. Fantastic bread, not tooooo horseradish-y, and really tender tasty roast beef. Usually I stay away from roast beef because of all the weird stringy parts to the beef that you can't bite through so you end up pulling all the meat out from between the bread. Am I the ONLY one that happens to?...\nAnyway.\nWe also ordered the Red Goat salad, and the goat cheese was amazing! It was really creamy and not goat-y at all! Sometimes goat cheese makes me gag because it tastes like barn. You know?\nOk, now I'm starting to sound like a whiner. I'm not.\nThen we also ordered the Cash Money hot sandwich, which is Cashew butter, mildly spicy and sweet pepper jelly and banana. Sounds weird but it was Great! \nI might go back again on Monday :)
5	Tyson is one of the most creative photographers I have seen in a long time. I was introduced to Tyson's work long before I knew Tyson. Tyson has a great eye for seeing past every day life and really delving in deeper. \n\nTyson has several art series he has produced centering around various cities within Arizona. Each of his pieces would look fabulous hanging in a living room. His pieces will spark conversation between your guests. \n\nTyson has worked several events I have attended and his images really tend to capture the true feelings of the event. \n\nIn addition, Tyson has worked with my family for senior portraits for our son. I get compliments every time I show his portraits. \n\nTyson is a true professional and I would highly recommend him for any photography job you have for him!
5	Qcumber is a lot like when a relative dies and you have to sort through all of their stuff for what you would like to keep only without the grief of the death.\n\nThey are full, full, full of great dusty old things. There are amazing finds to be had here. \n\nI have a thing for old cameras and have bought a couple here, I have a few retro chairs that I have bought. They always have amazing olf furniture of every style.\n\nMy favorite part about Qcumber is the old window panes, doors and iron pieces. This is the kind of place that you see people on the DIY network visiting and wonder why you don't have one near.  Good News! You do!\n\nLook past the dust and appreciate the treasures to be found.
5	I am already a fan of European Wax Center and the method they use for waxing compared to the typical salon method. Much less painful and better in the long run.\n\nI usually go to the Desert Ridge location for Brazilians, but since this one opened closer to my house, I went in for an arm wax. I was very impressed with the service. Briana was my waxer and was nothing but friendly, helpful, and clearly skilled in what she does. She explained all of the different things she was doing to me as she did them and made sure I was satisfied with everything before I left.\n\nI will definitely return for my next waxing needs.
3	This place popped up out of nowhere!  We went in for breakfast today and business was booming.  I bet all of the people that work in nearby office places go here for some morning coffee and bagel.  \n\nThey have pretty inexpensive breakfast specials, but like Lindsey said, I wasn't blown away either... I had fruit salad and my bf had a bagel sandwich.  Very limited menu but they do carry Boar's Head meats and sell by the lb.  \n\nGo here for bagels, bagel sandwiches, and possibly a side of potato salad or tuna... not much else at the moment, but they just opened so hopefully their menu will grow to include more egg selections and salads?\n\nVery friendly service, outdoor seating option, and easy parking in the lot as well... great for the Desert Ridge area!
1	Do not be fooled by the fact that they have the same location and phone number as the previous florist at this location. (Green Wood Pecker was awesome. I live out of town now and they were my go to for local delivery) \n\nCalled Floral Fantasy directly, twice to ensure next day delivery to a funeral. \n\nI was made to feel that I was inconveniencing them and was told to order via the website instead. I did this WHILE ON THE PHONE with them as I wanted to be sure delivery would take place when memorial would start at 8:00 am next day. I even put the times, address and phone of the service and church in the special instructions field while ordering on line. \n\nI was mortified to hear that no flowers were delivered. \n\nDo not go here: \n\nhttp://www.floralfantasy.info/ \n\nWaiting to see if the promised refund will materialize.
3	"""When a friend asked me to meet them for lunch and eat some fry bread, I immediately thought ~ \is the fair or a carnival in town?\""""  No, this is not your carnie type of fry bread, it much better!!\n\nWe met at The Fry Bread House and found it to be this little gem of a place that's kind of a hole in the wall.  You must look for the street sign to find them because they are set back off the road and since this is a small place they are kind of hard to find.  Their parking lot is usually full so you may want to park around the side.\n\nRestaurant ~ nothing fancy here but it's very cleaned and kind of 70's dinerish. You walk in and step up to the counter and place your order. There are a lot of regular's and locals that dine here, so don't be afraid to ask one of them about your choices.\n\nService ~ friendly bunch of folks working here.  Everything is pretty much self-serv.  They are not very green friendly and use lots of plastic and stryo foam.\n\nFood ~ The fry bread and red chili beef stew was very good and I would get it again.  The red chili stew was pipping hot with a very good balance of seasoning that wasn't too spicy and it had a good balance of meat to broth.  The fry bread was a little sweet, very tasty but it was a little too greasy. I know it's fry bread but I thought it would be a little more crispy.  We also had their tacos with beef and a veggie taco.  Both were very good however I should have eaten the taco first before my stew because the meat, beens and yummy goodness inside the taco was too much for the fry bread to hold up to.  It fell apart when trying to pick it up.  \n\nAll in all it was a very good experience and I'm looking forward to going back to The Fry Bread House to try an opened faced taco, their green chili stew and some fry bread desert!  Oh my!"""""""
4	So many bad pizza places, but now and then you find a good one!  When I try a new pizza place I always order the same pizza so I get great comparisons.  I get a thin medium pizza with TOMB (my name for it, spooky eh?) Tomato, onions, mushrooms and bacon.  Their's was great, the pizza sauce was slightly spicy and I ordered extra sauce and cooked well done.  Slices of roma tomatoes, red onions and small brown mushroom caps.  The bacon was crumbled in very small pieces and not very abundant unfortunately, losing them a star. The crust was both crunchy and chewy, very pleasant.  All in all, a good find and I will be back.
4	Second chance at bolero's.\nAfter receiving a phone call from one of the managers regarding our visit in April, we decided to try again.  We were told they would make things right and they were very apologetic for the horrible evening we had.  (We were so irritated with the place, we waited 4 months to take him up on the offer)\nAs an aside, we were told we would be comped dinner due to the previous disaster.\n\nI called ahead and spoke to Jason, who does not work at Bolero's any longer, but stated that since he was the manager at the time the incident occurred, he would make sure the new manager was aware that they needed to adhere to his promise to make things right.  Was told to call manager Desi, but no one answered.  Proceeded to the restaurant and hoped for the best.  \n\nWhen we got there, as before, we stood at the front desk for between 5 and 10 minutes before anyone came to seat us.  Not a promising start.  Luckily though, that's where the lame service ended.\n\nWe had Gage as a server and he did a terrific job.  He was attentive, stopped by to fill our drinks often, checked to make sure our food was good, brought things out all at the same time, and was pleasant to deal with.  \n\nWe started with the cheese plate and it was, as before, good although probably could use some more bread with it as there are a ton of meats and cheeses and 4 small pieces of bread.  As far as the food goes, she had the spinach salad, and I had the reuben with onion rings.  Both dishes were well prepared and tasty.  We asked for a basket of bread, which was brought out with dinner.  The bread was great, but they maybe ought to consider bringing it out early, maybe just asking people if they'd like bread with their meal.  Just a suggestion.\n\nOur only other concern as far as the menu goes is that there are not a lot of vegetarian offerings that aren't salad.  \n\nOverall, it was a much better experience.  As we said before, Gage did a great job, and even though Jason is no longer the manager there, Dave (who was standing in for Desi, from what we were told) took care of everything.  They put effort into making this experience much better and they did a good job.  We both appreciated it and we'd go back.\n\nThere it is, an updated review.  Bolero's is in a beautiful location and now we can say the service & food are worth a visit.
5	5 stars all the way. \n\nLet me begin by saying that I'm a big fan of the products. The store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these 2 things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when I step in the door. \n\nI'm not a huge coffee fan, but I can order some of the coffee drinks here. I'm completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from Starbucks, but I can't get enough of the caramel ice blended from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.\n\nSo now that we've established that I love the product, we can move on to the real reason this place gets a 5 star review--the staff. I've never seen anything like it. If you come in 3-7 times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink.\n\nLeila is the best at this. She knows peoples names, their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive. She'll see a regular customer's car pull up and she'll have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door. THAT is the epitome of customer service.
4	Went to this location last week - was nervous to go because although I love waffles, and fried chicken, the idea of eating them together freaked me out.  But my husband is a huge fan, so I decided to suck it up.  I'm glad I did... Although I typically prefer my waffles a little crispier than LoLo's makes them, the flavor was to die for!!!  And who doesn't love some delicious fried chicken!  I know I do.... Try it!  You'll love it!
4	My most familiar place for seafood in the valley. (I am still expanding my base). I have enjoyed each visit to the Fish Market. I enjoy the casual atmosphere and the friendly accommodating service. The sushi is basic but fresh as is the selection of sashimi. The fresh oysters are the best, and I can never pass up an oyster shooter, lol. You can make a meal out of their Baked Oysters Rockefeller which are one of my favorite items on the menu.  The cioppino is great but you must have patience and napkins to work the crab and shellfish out of their shells.  Their linguini with clams and any sauce is the best (again patience and napkins for removing clams from their shells).  Their chowders and smoked fish options are great.  I also enjoy watching as they prepare any item that is being grilled over mesqite coals.  I have yet to be dissapointed, whether seated in the dining room or choosing to eat at the bar.
1	Sorry but once again I don't get it. This is a nice place, salsa out of pumps....oh you fancy huh. This is within walking distance from the new pad. I went against my better judgement.....kicking and screaming mind you. Decided to give this place another go or 5....maybe this location is better? The first time we tried it they were closed, the second time we barely made it. No carne asada? No chile relleno? Why God why must you toy with me?!?!? This place is NOT the best place.....the green sauce isn't green at all it's GREY people!!! You know what makes it that color? Flour.....more like gravy. You like the tortillas I could care less really its a super large thin tortilla there's nothing special about it. CALM DOWN. The kid behind the counter tells me to try the breakfast thats their specialty. My 3rd Carolinas attempt was for breakfast and once again I was very underwhelmed. I have tried basically everything on the menu all this stuff is pretty basic and a major let down. The rice and beans are good fyi.
5	"""Four of us dined there on Christmas Eve and it was absolutely incredible! The food, service, wine and atmosphere were all second to none.  \nBeverages - we consumed 3 bottles of Arizona Stronghold \Mangus\"""" (from Reverend Maynard James Keenans' vineyard up north).\nFood - we each got something different.....the best way to do it......\n-Foie gras torchon...excellent\n-Scallop Ceviche....excellent\n-Wild Mushroom Soup....excellent\n-Tuna Tartar....excellent\n\n-Beech Mushroom Risotto with fresh shaved white truffles...no words to describe how great this was.\n\n-John Dory....excellent\n-Duck Breast....excellent\n-Duo of Pork....excellent\n-Seared Scallops...excellent\n\nWe all couldn't of been happier with the whole experience! Also, I love the (really) open kitchen...\nCan't wait to go back!"""""""
3	"""I SOOOO wanted to love this place as it is cute as a bug's ear. Not that I'm saying there's bug's here,  I just think it's a lovely, modern clean space, with lots of light. My friend was craving the Greek pita. \OMG...it's soooo good, you have to go get us some.\"""" So, I get our to go pitas (chicken, lettuce, feta and tomato), certainly not inventive, yet it sounded like it would hit the spot. \""""OMG....the side pasta is sooooo good, you have to get that.\"""" Fine. Two Greek pitas both with pasta sides to go. Oh, and the chocolate cake. He said to get the chocolate sheet cake. Well, let me just say kiddies, the pita was dry, dry, dry. Sauceless and dry. Did I say it was dry. Chicken was dry. Pita was dry. It totally fell apart. And then so did I. Dry. Dry I say. Pasta side was actually quite good, all 2 oz. of it. BUT THE CAKE...OH MARY....THE CAKE! Truly a slice of chocolate heaven. I will go back and try some other items. Staff was friendly. I liked the space. Cake was, cheap, like a penny or something."""""""
3	I went here for a friend's birthday. We wanted to hang out in the bar area to have drinks, appetizers, and listen to the live music.  It seemed like no one wanted to serve us, but by the time we had a table and started to order our service got better... It just took a while.  We were there after the dinner rush so I don't know why they were being so difficult.  Our drinks and food were very good and ended up being a fun night.  I just don't know if I would come back.
5	A rare authentic gem in Phoenix. This is the best french bakery / bistro in the Valley. The owner is from Lyon and has been here with his family for 10 years or so. His french pastry chef is extraordinary. Very unique find - imported directly from France as well. He's probably 80 and has prefected so many of his recipes. All of the pastries here are truly awesome.\n\nI haven't eaten here for lunch. But, the after dinner or before movie treats here are very good.
2	what happened to the menu? i went for the enchiladas but the only kind they had on the menu contained egg. not to mention the entire menu has been drastically pared down offering not much of a selection. and the chips and salsa have actually gone up to $7. we ordered chips and salsa, one beer, one soda and two entrees (me tacos, the boyfriend fajitas)  for a grand total of $60. the price is a bit tough to justify and i don't see us going back anytime soon, which is disappointing.
5	My sister and I visited Tocasierra Spa while on vacation in Phoenix (we were staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak, which this spa is a part of).  We scored facial and pedicure appointments with little notice, and were very impressed with the spa facility and the staff.  I still contact this spa (from North Carolina!) to mail-order their sugar butter body scrub and lotion -- it is the BEST!  \n\nIf you are in Phoenix and need spa services or just a manicure/pedicure, I recommend calling Tocasierra.  At the time we were in Arizona, we read that Tocasierra was rated one of the top ten spas in the state so you may be better off getting an appointment instead of hoping for walk-in luck.  We probably got lucky with our appointments because we were staying at the hotel.
3	I seriously love Pita Jungle. I've been eating at the Tempe location since it was a little hole in the wall but this location at Ray and Dobson is just too busy (I think). As much as I love the food I think the kitchen staff should take a little more time in preparing their dishes. The other day I ordered a lentil salad for lunch that was soo delicious but I'm 99% sure the rice was bad and I became violently ill right after lunch. Too bad... \n\nSecondly, I ordered a vegan version of a meal that did have chicken in it and substituted it for tofu for my vegan friend. I came home with the food to come to find chicken was in his meal. This could have been really bad if we didn't notice it right away. \n\nI just hope that someone from Pita can read this post and realize that a loyal customer just wants to give some constructive criticism. I love this restaurant but if I keep running into these situations I'm going to have to deem it another careless chain restaurant which is NOT what I'd want to do at all.
5	My trophy wife and I and a few of the offspring decided that we wanted to try out this Manuels. We picked Friday night at 6:30 and the place was packed with a 30 minute wait, but the staff moved the customers in and out very quickly and we were soon munching chips and salsa. The wife is very picky about salsa, not really liking any restaurant's offering that we have experienced in the last few years so imagine my surprise when I looked at the bowl of chips and there were only little pieces left. We had very prompt and attentive service, me and the wife splitting the order of pollo especial because one of my fellow yelpers recommended it and they were certainly correct. Everyone was delighted with their food,and we all scarfed the sopapillas afterwards.This is a great place to take your family to have someone else do the cooking  and enjoy some wonderful Az style mexican food.
2	I think this Savers is getting their layout confused with Goodwill, which is like Target getting confused with Walmart; both in the same category, just one is more classier than the other. I used to live by this Savers and would frequent it every day yes, literally every day back when they used to have great items. Just pop in real quick. Over time they changed the layout and experimented with things. \n\nAfter visiting today I saw that now everything is so crowded based on the way they structured everything using the same space with the same amount of stuff. The shoes are racked above the clothes racks now. This is extremely, extremely annoying. There is no emoticon to express how annoyed I am by this move. I understand they are trying to make the shoes central to the clothes so they are in the same spot, the shoes are racked by size of course snaking down each aisle. Sooo to look at shoes you have to go down a couple of aisles waiting for people to get out of your way, rather than have them in one spot like they used to be. Of course people are not going to magically put back shoes where they belong so you might find shoes in the right place, or you might end of having to walk down each and every aisle looking at the shoe size stickers making sure they are not cute and your shoe size respectively. Savers, please correct this annoying inconvenience. \n\nAlso if you genuinely find an item with a tag missing they won't sell the item to you. Listen I get it, this is such a high traffic thrift store that there is a good reason for this but you must wait until the next day for them to price the item and put it back, they won't hold it for you. They don't call a manager over to simply price the item out for you, so how is this good customer service for the innocent ones? Why punish everyone? Why not do like some other stores do and mark the clothing label with a washable marker so that way if the price tag comes off, based on the color they have a pricing system set up? Either way, end up taking the time to re-price and re-stock it again. \n\nThey should also implement some type of buzzer at the jewelry counter, I don't know how many times I have gone there, not just this location, only to wait and wait finally having to ask a cashier to send someone over to help me because there is never anyone there. The service is always impatient at the counter too, I don't know about you but I like to make up my mind about a purchase! This place is just too picked over, it is nothing like it used to be in its heyday. Way crowded on weekends and busy in the evening. If you bring donations you get a coupon for $3-5 off your min $10 purchase with a tax deductible tag. I will say housewares are your best bet here, good condition and best prices. If you are looking for generic clothing fine, but diamond in the rough stuff like I am accustomed to? no, you won't find that here.
5	"""I've been wanting to try this place since moving to Chandler last month and especially after reading the reviews.  Ordered take out tonight and it was absolutely delicious!  They take \carbs\"""" to a whole new level :)  The noodles stand on their own....you can absolutely tell that they are homemade.  The thick noodles (there are several varieties) with minced pork sauce have a wonderful savory flavor and include diced cabbage and green onions.  The egg rolls were just as delicious and even the chicken fried rice (I know, rice at a noodle place?) was perfectly prepared.\n\nThis will definitely be another \""""go to\"""" spot in lovely Chandler :)"""""""
2	Tried it for the first time this week. My sub was tasty but just a roastbeef and cheese sub on a cursty roll. Can't figure out what all the rage over this chain is about. It's fast service which is great when you need food fast. But it's a little over priced sandwhich and fountain drink both. My lunch was $8.  The place is clean but not really inviting as 90% of the customers take it to go or eat at an outdoor table.
1	"""We knew before we even left the house that we were going to be disappointed with our meal wherever we chose.  For some reason good restaurants on this side of town are damn near impossible to find.  I was feeling like having a Mexican breakfast and although I had heard bad things about this place I decided to give it a try anyways because it was on our route.\n\nUnfortunately, they dont serve breakfast other than a buffet.  The wife got chicken taquitos and I did the brunch buffet.  The horchata was excellent.  The salsa was ok and thats about where it ended.  The brunch was 15.95 and definitely not even worth half of that.  The eggs were bla.  The fruit wasn't ripe.  The bacon was undercooked.  The sausage was overcooked.  And I completely missed the omelet station.  The wife couldnt eat more than two of her taquitos they were so bad.  The manager then came by and opened the patio doors even though we had a 3 month baby right by them and it was a pretty cold morning.  Considerate.\n\nThe comment that summed it all up was when my wife said \For all the money the  spent on this building and decor they should have spent some in the kitchen on a real chef and better ingredients.\""""  I told her well at least I have something to yelp about.\n\nI'm not sure why its so hard to put a good restaurant on this side of town but if someone did it would probably be a gold mine."""""""
5	Word on the street from the locals is that this new spot is the talk of the town, so I felt very lucky that I got to go here for a work dinner last night. We breezed right in to our reservation with no problems and the waiters made us feel comfortable right away. I liked the feel of the place right away, too, with the high beamed ceilings, big open glass doors and cute, stylish touches scattered about. \n\nThe cocktail menu looked to die for but I was in a beer frame of mind so I went with their peach beer, which I loved, because it reminded me of Pyramid Apricot Ale, which is one of my East Bay faves. The others got some amazing looking concoctions, though, so if I ever get back here I'll be sure to get a cocktail. I was really impressed because one of my dining companions couldn't decide what beer she wanted so asked if they could serve her a flight, and they were happy to oblige (I'm not sure how she ended up getting charged for that, but the effort was still nice). \n\nWe got a bunch of appetizers to share. The mac and cheese is not as heavy and gooey as a lot of 'fancy' mac and cheeses that I've had, and I could not stop eating it. We also had some enchiladas with shrimp and sweet corn that was amazing. And of course, I couldn't resist the brussels sprouts - I can never resist brussels sprouts. I liked that they had shaved manchego on them but I have to say I've had better cooked and more flavorful brussels sprouts in my life. I think my least favorite app was the roasted veggie because it was a bit flavorless compared to everything else, and people didn't seem too enthused about the matzo ball soup either. \n\nFor my entree, I shared half of the salmon dish and half of the short rib with my neighbor. They've recently re-done the salmon dish, so it's different from the way it's described on the menu. The waiter had a really quiet voice so I had to have him repeat it to me a couple of times, but basically now they grill the salmon with salt and pepper and serve it with brussels petals and cornbread panzanella, cucmbers and some sort of yummy vinaigrette. I loved it! I love my salmon super rare so I wish they had asked me how I wanted it, but everyone else was perfectly fine with it. The short rib was very good as well - we replaced the mashed potatoes with more roasted veggies, but it also comes with string beans, one of my other favorite veggies. \n\nThe desserts were vast and impressive. Despite my loud, showy protests, I couldn't help digging my spoon into the gourmet s'mores dish, with its caramelized marshmallow and chocolate covered bacon, the creme brulee (standard but good), and my favorite, the sweet potato pie. My least favorite was the blueberry crumble, which surprised me because I was positive that it would be my favorite. \n\nI'm no expert in Scottsdale culture, but I have a feeling that this little hotspot in a strip mall may be a major player in the local cuisine - its fresh, classic dishes and friendly service are definite crowd pleasers!
5	The last time I got a filling, it was a miserable experience and is the #1 reason I've been putting off visiting the dentist for the last three years.\n\nI went in for fillings this morning and arrived about 5 minutes late. Nobody seemed irritated at my tardiness, there was no rushing, and I still got out in an hour and a half - exactly as long as they said it would take.\n\nMy comfort was priority. Dr. Amy & Kristen were super attentive to body language. They would feel my hand every so often to see if I was tense, gave me breaks to rest my jaw, gave me vaseline for my lips to prevent chapping, and complimentary happy gas was of course a plus. (All of this while watching Office Space? Win!)\n\nThe really refreshing part is that one of my fillings was very deep and potentially in need of a root canal. While it looked ok today, Dr. Amy warned me it could progress a bit, even after being treated. If for any reason I have to get a root canal in the near future (within the year), she will only charge me whatever is in excess of the filling she did today. A dentist with a warranty? Awesome.\n\nOverall, this was probably as enjoyable as getting a filling can be. I am not dreading my next dental appointment at all.
5	"""I had dinner last night for the first time at this place, and I have to say that I really really liked it a lot!  Upon entering the location, I was impressed with how it was set up.  Clean, nice, with lots of outdoor seating.  \n\nThe decor gave me a \fancy\"""" feeling of dining, yet without the menu sticker shock.  Clean nice marble looking tables, some booths, and  a big beautiful mirror hung from one of the walls.  Well decorated!\n\nAfter sitting down to eat with Gabi, We were waited on almost immediately, and the server was attentive, and gave us time to think about our orders.  The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from, and from what I could tell, ALL the prices were relatively cheap!\n\nI ended up eating the Gyro pita, and I must say, it was tasty, and the portion was quite ample and large. \n\n I would put this on my list of places to return for the good eats since I was so happy the first time around.  I feel that you can't go wrong at this place, from my experience.

3	Mayonaise makes me gag. I don't care how you prepare it, mix it, twist it, shout it...it grosses me out so bad. people who like/love/don't mind mayo always say things to me like 'try this potato salad, you can't even taste the mayo' and you know what? they are always lying. \n\nanyway, i ordered the turkey club and asked them to hold the honey mustard spread. thankfully there wasn't any mayo so i didn't have to ask them to hold that either. this sandwich has a ton of my faves: tomato, turkey, bacon, cheese, avocado. scrumptious ingredients. \n\nas soon as it's in my car, i can smell mayonaise. i think to myself 'oh, you're crazy, it's your immagination- the description said nothing about mayo' \n\nwell i am crazy, but my nose was right. mayo. on. my. sandwich. \n\nusually i wouldn't flip out but my large sexy dirty chai and sandwich cost me $15. the drink alone was worth the $4 something dollars for several reasons, but the sandwich was gross and totally over priced. the bacon was pretty bad, and i ended up taking off most of the ingredients bc it wasn't very good. i was able to wipe off most of the mayo from the turkey and avocado so i ate that.\n\ni was just so, so sad. \n\nthe customer service is great, the sexy dirty chai is great but the food i will not eat again.
4	First time at the new restaurant in a familiar location.     I was a fan of Lisa G's (I knew Lisa).     Maybe I had some lingering wistfulness about the previous establishment.     But not anymore.\n\nWe had lunch at TMI.     The menu is great!     No matter what your taste, you will find something you like.     In fact, although it is not a huge menu, I will venture that you will find several things you like.     I did and I'm a pretty picky eater.\n\nOur server was friendly and helpful.     The food was really, really good.    Next time I want to try dinner and sample some ale.    \n\nWe will be back!
2	"""I'm surprised there is not a review already about this Street of New York in Anthem.  But then again, most people won't complain about there experiences and just not go back.

They will make more time for their friends than you.  \n\nSo why give them 2 stars and not 1 star?

4	The brisket is wonderful, super tasty bark, nice smoke ring.  We got the cutters choice which is in between the juicy yet fattier cut and the lean cut, a good all round compromise.  Wasn't a big fan of the sauces, not bad but nothing spectacular but the brisket is so good you really dont need any.\n\nThe mac&cheese is good, as is the cole slaw, wasn't a fan of the cream corn, just too sweet for me.

2	"""Tuesday, 5:30 pm \nMy buddy and I waltz into Lobby's because he was jonesin' for a burger and didn't want to fight the lines at In-N-Out.\n\nWhy, you ask, is Liz B. writing a review for a burger and hot dog joint when she freely admits that she has never liked meat and her parents even paid her to eat burgers as a child?

You can add on cheese (provolone) and mushrooms or peppers for $.79 each, making your sad, awful sandwich about $5.\nMy buddy ordered the double burger with provolone, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and hot peppers.

3	I had high hopes for Metro after longing to visit after my last dinner which had left a good impression on me . Despite some positive press review, I found Metro to be terribly disappointing this time around and lacking substance or lacking for a better word.\n\nService started off great and then went aloof from there as if we did not exist. The breakfast was nothing reminiscent of a French bistro or brasserie whatsoever. What happened to the wonderful croissants and pains au chocolat ? Borrowing from another review, service was indeed ridiculously slow and indifferent.\n\nI really wanted to see you succeed Metro, but I kinda lost faith. I hope you put a little bit more work in the service delivery and decoration of your awfully cold and depressing dining room.
1	Really as bad as it gets.\nCrap food.\nOver priced.\nUgly, tasteless interior\nBad music and music system\nTired staff\nThis place needs to either have a complete redo or it needs to close. \nI would rather go down the street and eat at Applebee's, and I have never been to an Applebee's. Too many other choices now in the neighborhood for this place to go on in its present condition. Then again, there might be enough people around these parts with really bad taste to keep the place going.
3	I was not impressed. For a business traveler, there are better choices nearby. \nWhen I drove up, the valet told me there was no self park, but I could see it less than 100 yards away from my room. I used it during my stay, and it was convenient and much less expensive. \nThe entry of the hotel was constantly blocked by party goers, and I couldn't find any alternate entrance/exit. \nMy bill was wrong at checkout. They adjusted it, but then mysteriously placed an additional unauthorized charge of $13.94 on my credit card. \nSeriously wishing I opted for Embassy Suites across the road...
3	NoRTH seems to be just yet another overated Fox restaurant.  We went away somewhat disappointed after reading all the positive reviews from fellow Yelpers.  Here's my breakdown -\n\n1. Space - the restaurant has a somewhat cool vibe, but the space is too open.  There's nothing that really breaks the room up, so you just feel like you're in a big room of tables.  Not bad, just not super compelling.    \n\n2. Menu - pretty good set of options.  Seemed like a strong start here.\n\n3. Food - this is where things started to slip.  A good indication of the quality of an Italian restaurant is it's bread.  This wasn't the good stuff - it was the light tasteless unnoticeable bread that every medium Italian restaurant serves.  Ours was dry, maybe because it was later in the evening.  The food was all beautifully presented, but lacked great flavor.  I'm a big fan of burata but theirs was entirely flavorless.  Salads were overdrenched in dressing, though the ideas were good.  \n\n3. Service - our waitress seemed very well-intentioned and nice, but paid us very little attention.  Asked for olive oil with the bread instead of the standard butter - oops, missed this.  Asked if we wanted more appetizer olives - then forgot to bring them.  Seemed to approach the table at awkward times, but then was nowhere to be found when trying to pay.  Not super impressive.  \n\nBottomline: This restaurant is kinda mediocre.  It's hard to really go beneath 3 stars, because it's nice and moderately well executed, but it's far from inspiring or even a solid recommend to friends.  Options might be few up here in North Glendale, which is the only reason I can think for why others rate it 4 stars.

4	"""Yes, Marjele's has made it to Old Town. Yes, this is the same Marjele's that you have probably been to before a sporting event in Downtown Phoenix, but this is Marjele's with the Old Town twist. That means, this is Marjele's; Scottsdale edition. However, so far it's doing pretty good in my book! \n\nOld Town lacks good sports bars and the ones they have fill up within 20 minutes on the day or night of a big game. So with that, I was pleased to hear that Marjele's gave us another sports bar option. I visited for the first time several weeks ago. Marjele's might have been open all of three days so we decided to check it out. Prior to going, we called to see if there was a chance they accepted reservations. And guess what? They did! Now, I don't know if this will last forever, but at the time, they took a reservation (I hope it stays like that!) The staffer on the phone was extremely polite and friendly when I talked to them. We arrived as one of the games was ending and before the next one started. The sports bar was jam packed so they didn't have our table yet, but they were extremely apologetic and got us one as soon as the first one opened up. So for that, they get a point for customer service. \n\nThe scene: Considering this is a sports bar, I'm not shocked to say that this place was packed with men. All men. There might have been all of 15 girls in the bar when we were there. I assume this will change over time as girls realize that the ratio is in their favor. There is a nice long patio and then room inside with several tables and high tops, two bars and a standing area. TVs surround the entire bar, just like in the Downtown location. I think this Marjele's is bigger than the Downtown location, but it's a toss up. Now, like I said above, this one is definitely Scottsdaled up. At night, it's dark and \sceney\"""" but it's still not bad yet. We'll see how long they keep it as a chill sports bar, especially since it's by PCL and now next door to the new El Hefe. I think this is a good option to watch a game or to visit on a night you want to go out in Old Town. \n\nThe food: thumbs up in my book! This is generic bar food but decent bar food. The wings have a spicy kick to them. For my meal, I got the buffalo chicken wrap. It was tasty and tangy with a twist. The sandwich filled me up and unlike some other sports bars around town, I would be ok with eating here again. But again, remember...this is just sports bar food so don't walk into Marjel's expecting fine dining. Expect beers and fried food and you'll be set. \n\nSo in conclusion, check out Marjele's if you're up for being out in Old Town, you're ok with running into the Old Town crowd, you want to watch a game at a place that will be crowded and social and you want to enjoy some food and drinks along the way...served by friendly staff of course!"""""""

3	"""So I used to really like this place (5 star level).. I would visit if not weekly at least 2x a month with coworkers.  The wine glasses are $5 each until 6pm and their menu was decent and healthy (and filling) for something to munch on while pounding wine glasses (btw, I don't advise 'pounding' wine ... at all!).\n\nLately, when I've gone, Iv'e noticed the wait staff is VERY lax... as a matter of fact when I was there tonight, the guy server just tossed the bill at us.  Yes, \tossed\"""".  Add to that that the gals serving nearby and also serving us were waaaay too busy playing eye-candy for the old, fat Chandler farts next to us.  They were too busy hugging and giggling with the old (not even good looking) male farts to get our drinks and our checks in a timely manner.  That was just plain annoying.\n\nThe owner is something else, too.  That guy is there nightly,, flirting away and getting sauced.  Good for him that he can enjoy life like that, but if his staff was tip-top, I'd say he's doing a good job and deserves celebrating his success..... but since they aren't, I'd say he needs to focus on getting his staff tip-top before some of us former loyalists abandon ship (which a lot of us have from my work group).\n\nThe decoration and atmosphere were nice...

5	One restaurant for many occasions! I can go here for Saturday or Sunday brunch. Bring out of town guests to sit on the patio. Take a date on Saturday night. Watch a game with a buddy. Have lunch by myself without feeling like a dork. Drop by for Happy Hour. Etc. I'm a huge fan of the homemade corned beef hash for brunch. My only complaint about the burger is that it's too big! But that's life in America. I've never had service issues like some other reviews, and I've been there when it's been busy and slow. If you don't see a parking spot up front, swing around back or park next door at night. There are a couple bars within walking distance if you want a change of venue for a night cap.
2	"""I had high hopes for this place.  Since the restaurant is located on busy Mill Avenue at a corner spot I assumed it had to be fantastic.  When you walk in the decor is of course asian themed and contemporary.  This joint tries to make Vietnamese food edible to novice palates.  Unfortunately, they fall short.  This is unfortunately as good as it gets.\n\nMy fiance and I took a seat on the outdoor patio to enjoy the great weather.  There were so many items on the menu and their website that looked and sounded appealing I didn't know what to try first.  This is what we had:\n\nSalt and Pepper Calamari - the breading was nice and light.  However the calamari was so so chewy.  It was seriously like chewing on an erasar.  I really didn't pick up any salt or pepper flavor either.  The dipping sauce was tasty tho.\n\nDragonfly Signature Spring Bowl with Charbroiled Chicken - My dish arrived with noodles, crispy egg roll and chicken.  It looked nothing like the pictures I saw.  Then a few minutes later our server came with the rest of the greens and vinaigrette.  After dressing up my dish, I expected to taste that authentic \fish\"""" sauce.  Dragonfly however, waters down their vinaigrette so the fish sauce is barely noticeable.  It's the tang and sourness of the sauce that brings tons of flavor to the dish and this dish was seriously lacking it.  I tasted the egg roll by itself and it tasted like it was old.  Blah!  It wasn't even wrapped nice and tight but instead was fried with one edge falling off.  I dunked it in the calamari sauce to hide the taste.\n\nDuring my dining experience on the patio, I had to swat off several bugs that were attacking my food.  A few I killed on my empty plates which was rather disgusting.  My bad for choosing to eat outdoors.\n\nI think Dragonfly has a lot of potential to be a great place.  They have a great location and decor.  Just need to work on taste and seasoning and I'm sure they'd be a hit."""""""
2	Yuck.  I've been here so many times because my family loves it, but I cringe every time I have to attend a family event here.\n\nTypical overly fried or sauced or cheesed gross generic Mexican food with no flavor or personality.\n\nI've literally tried just about everything on the menu and have been completely underwhelmed.  Now when I have to go there, I just order a plain bean and cheese burrito because it's simple enough to not be flavorless and boring.\n\nThe chips and salsa are pretty cool, though I don't care for their red salsa.  The other ones, including the bean and ranch dip, are good though.
5	Great food!  Great service!  Price - not for the faint-of-heart, but reasonable.\n\nThe previous reviews give you an idea of the ambience of Avanti.  I'll just add that The noir ambience is dominated by low-key lighting . . . and deep shadows, creating feelings of intimacy & privacy. . .  even in the middle of the room.\n\nI'll go back whenever you invite me to go. . .  and some other times too!\n\nThey serve larger portions than I want to surround, so I usually take home what's left on my plate.  It's great the next day.
3	Nice place to go and have a drink and watch sports. It's not very big on the inside and the bar is not very large either. The wait staff is friendly, but during happy hour, they don't come very often to the tables around the bar. Going up to the bar might be your best bet.  The potato skins are really good...they are thin, so you get about twenty or so on the plate. They are a tad on the greasy side, which makes them even better.  The other food is just OK...nothing really spectacular. The croutons they use in the caesar salad are odd tasting, and I don't like when places used chopped lettuce in caesar salads. I prefer the larger leafs.  The beer selection is medium sized...a little smaller than what I would think a place that bills itself as a taproom would offer.
5	I'm reviewing Sprout's vitamin and supplement center here. Sprout's Indian School location's general grocery is fair: customer service is sporadic, and often not helpful, especially in the produce where it's really needed.\n\nThe vitamin and supplement section is far superior. I always find what I need, and, as a vitamin neophyte, the staff is always very outgoing, friendly and very knowledgeable. \n\nJoel is like a supercomputer full of information about products, makers and effects of each of the vitamins and supplements - information I could only get by researching it on my own, which is preventative and time-exhaustive. \n\nPatty is great and very knowledgeable as well. They educate me to make the best decisions about the best price and most quality products. I walk away feeling more empowered, and confident knowing I am consuming what I really need - whether that's protein powder, amino acids, vitamins, or flax oils. They do an amazing job. At times this summer, they've run a 25% of all vitamins and supplements special, and if you spend $100, they take off 10%. A very good deal.
4	First trip here May 1, 2012. We were early, about 5:30pm. We walked right in and were seated with no wait. \n\nWait staff were professional and respectful. We asked questions and had all our confusion resolved quickly. After reading many of the reviews here on Yelp I was prepared for a different dining experience. I was pleasantly impressed.\n\nThe salad bar was a little un-impressive with a small-ish selection of veggies, cheese, meats, and dressings. I've been to a lot of salad bars in my life, this one was the nicest to look at but one of the poorest selections. I did not understand the concept of cold veggies normally served heated. Who serves cold cooked asparagus? This place does.\n\nSo the process is simple. Seating, order drinks, go to salad bar, and when ready flip your round coaster from red to green and the many meat serving men stop by with their steaks and other meats on steel rods to slice a serving after you specify your desired cook cut (medium rare to well). They give you tongs to grab the slice and pull it to your plate.\n\nAs long as your coaster sits green side up they keep coming every few minutes. Turn the coaster to red to halt the meat.\n\nThey seemed to come in waves with cooked meats to offer. I had the beef and declined the chicken and lamb. The meat guys were a bit on the quiet side so many of them I had to have them repeat which cut it was since I wanted to avoid lamb and pork.\n\nThe meats came fast and hot. We got filled-up quickly. \n\nThe service was excellent, dining room and salad bar was clean and beautiful. I would gladly return here. Probably not a place to go in jeans and a t-shirt. Our cost for two with tip was about $130, we don't consume alcohol or dessert.\n\nFollow-up: Been here twice more. Always pretty much the same experience. If I could change a few things; offer a way to warm the veggies on the salad bar, and to spread out the gauchos because when they arrive one after another after another makes it hard to eat and talk and deal with them. Plus if there was a way to communicate that the lamb and chicken guys can stay away, just the beef only please. What about different shaped coasters, colored, to communicate things like beef only? Just a suggestion. Oh yes, and the meat servers could speak a tiny bit louder too, or maybe a sign on the meat skewer instead of their table side whisper?\n\nMaybe next time I go back I'll bring my own BEEF ONLY sign!
3	"""My experience with Ted's was not a good one this time around.  It had been years since I had been  there  and I was not all that impressed back then.  It did not even make it on my \if I'm ever in the neighborhood again\"""" list.  But recently I had a craving for a hot dog and decided to try Ted's again.  I ordered a hot dog a  brat and a side of potato salad.  The hot dog was average at best.  The brat was RAW on the inside and inedible.  And the potato salad was completely tasteless and most of the potato's were hard from not being cooked long enough.  Even though I did not have a good experience I'm still not ready to check them off my list.  Although I will never drive from Phoenix to Ted's JUST for a hot dog like I did this last time I will at least give them one more shot if I'm ever in the area again."""""""
3	"""Yelp brought me here, as always!  I didn't exactly know what to expect of a place that calls itself Qwik (Chinese) - doesn't really lend itself to delicious, quality, or any other adjective that is the opposite of fast food.  \n\nThat having been said, the food was good!  I had some wonton soup and the almond chicken delivered.  The soup was flavorful enough, though there was probably more soup than ingredients.  The wontons themselves don't have the super thin kind of consistency, more of a thicker, chewy, doughy kind of texture.  I prefer the former which is why I brought this up.  Still good though.  The chicken dish itself was pretty good as well, using quality chicken (not that questionable, \is this rubber thing I'm chewing actually chicken?\"""" taste).  Flavorful as well, and doesn't leave you with that greasy, grimy, stuck in the bottom of your stomach kind of feeling like most other chinese does.  \n\nTo sum it up I'd say this place has the intent of a more traditional/home cooked kind of chinese meal, but it's been tailored a bit for stateside consumption.  Won't stop me from going back though!"""""""
1	"""So I had this important event to attend in California and I've already spent a lot of money preparing for my trip. Earlier in the month I had received a coupon for $40 off any service at Epic salon. Wow, that is a lot of savings and I could sure use to save some money. Epic uses  Goldwell products which is my product of choice. I just needed a tint touch-up (about 1\) so I went to this salon... I had already had an awesome experience at another salon in town, but I couldn't pass up the savings by using the $40 coupon)  I was second-guessing the idea of trying a new salon since I had already found one I absolutly loved. .Again though, the coupon lured me in. Anyway, I walked away with the worst experience ever. Not only was my color wrong ( I am a golden blonde and she colored my 1' outgrowth to a 3\"""" ash) when I went back in to explain what was so wrong with it (5min later), the front desk lady was rude and cut me off as I was speaking to her. Not the best way to handle a pissed of lady expecially about her hair! I gave them a chance to fix it and the only thing they did was put a gold glaze on my hair, which did not help at all.  The style sucked too. I just left. I did not have time to see if they could fix it again. I will not be going back to this place for any services. Noy only because the hair experience was bad, but because the front desk gal made a bad impession of the place even worse with her nastiness. UGH! I will give this place 1 star only because on the coupon was also a savings of 30% off products."""""""
4	Great vege. friendly place to eat. Lots of options here. Consistent quality food. My favorites are spring rolls, pad broccoli, peanut curry, pad Thai.

You'll see what I'm talking about when you're driving home or chilling at your place. Change clothing and do some bong rips.
3	Went there tonight for dinner and I am kinda on the fence. I have never had food like this so it was all new to me. we ordered the flammenkuchen and it was good but I am not a big cheese fan so that threw me off a bit but the rest of the table devoured it and raved about how amazing it was. we all ordered crepes I had the one with bacon potato and onions, the rest had a 4 cheese one, the ratatouille and the one with scallops. the rest of the table ate every bite of their crepes but I had just a quarter of mine. I think its just not for me but I am sure it is quite good by the reviews here and my other table mates. we finished with the chocolate fondue it was OK it came with apples strawberries brownie bites and cream puffs good but not earth shattering. I am sure my friends will run back but I think I will stay behind next time.
5	Two things I am not...your typical Sam Fox food disciple and the type of person who would seek out healthy food.  So True food Kitchen,  is not the the type of face I would inhereantly rave about.  However, I am open minded and I do love a great product and service, so True truly nails it.  It is well documented that the food is great, match that with attentive, crisp, knowledgible service and hip yet comfortable dining room and this place rocks.  After a couple of visits it is now definately on my regular rotation.
5	I have gone to this UPS store for years.  The staff are all very friendly and efficient.  One time I was in and a very senior woman was sending a package.  The man helping her was patient and courteous and treated her with utmost respect.  It was nice to see him treat an older person with such dignity.  They are very good to their customers and if you want a smiling welcome when you walk through the door you won't be disappointed.
1	I was surprised that the service was so poor after all of the good reviews.  Everything about the night was slow. Our waitress started off with an attitude as if she would rather be ANYWHERE but working. The drinks took forever and my husband noticed they were ready but she was too busy talking to the bartender to bring our drinks. Our entrees arrived without ever getting our appetizer. We were upset but when we saw how big the portions were we got over it. We stopped another wait person to ask for the manager whom we assumed was the lady we saw chatting and laughing at the bar with our server and the bartender. She never came.  Our server never checked on us until we were done eating. My husband asked for the check and the appetizer was not on it. We waited almost 15 minutes for her to run our credit card before stopping someone else. She was too busy at the bar, again.  I would try it again because we liked the food and the atmosphere but make sure we ask that Teddy not be our waitress.
5	On Cinema Suites*: If you are of age with no children or in a group full of adults, do yourself a favor and upgrade. Five stars for this experience.\n\nWith no children, you can eat comfortably and get engrossed in the movie without the unexpected jolt of a baby crying or a parent snapping at a kid to be quiet. \n\nThe smaller and more intimate setting with fewer seats and better chairs translates to comfort. I loved the fact that you can recline with your feet up and still use the large tray. To those who complain of not being able to eat when reclined, this isn't Rome. Sit up when you eat, and lay back when you're done. It's good for your digestion.\n\n*Fork and Screen and Cinema Suites are separated by a wide, wide ocean of class, ambiance, and comfort. This review completely ignores Fork and Screen because of how bad it is.
1	"""I'm giving this business one star for at least being cooperative about giving me my money back.  I have a leather sofa that was originally plump and cushy, but the seat cushions had been squished out of shape by years of use.  After reading the reviews on Yelp, I took the cushions to Chair-A-Medic be refurbished.  When I got them back, they were relatively flat on top rather than overstuffed.  I took them home and sat on them and they were as hard as a board.  After one evening, I went to bed with aching hips.  Chair-A-Medic had also sewed a tear in the fabric side of one of cushions, and that was already visibly failing to hold.  \n\nI returned with the cushions and talked to Bob, the owner.  I even took a cushion off our loveseat, which had little wear, to show him what the original was like.  He said he'd try re-doing one cushion to see if he could get it the way I wanted.  When I got that one back, it not only was nearly as hard, but it was so far from filled out that the leather sagged in front.  I took that one back and Bob told me he didn't know what I wanted and that I wouldn't be able to find what I wanted.  I said, \Oh, I think I will.\""""  \nHe did refund my money, and asked for the foam cores back.\n  \nI took the cushions to an upholstery business where the owner took great care to order the softer foam I wanted and to get the overstuffed look of the original.  He also fixed the tear.\n\nNow that I've returned the cores, I would never go back to Chair-A-Medic as it seems to me that 1) they don't know what they're doing, or 2) they use inferior materials to save money, or 3) both of the above."""""""
4	Ah Pita Jungle. I've been going there for 14 years now. They served me my first hummus. I've had a number of friends who worked there over the years. The service is the only dynamic factor in my rating. I've run the gambit as far as that is concerned. Overall they are solid. If you are a dip person, try ordering a half and half order of their garlic dip and hummus. Totally worth it. Their shawarma always hits the spot. The falafel platter is the best buy for the money.
5	I can't say that I'm a hotdog connoisseur but every once and a while I do get the craving for a good hot dog.   I don't eat beef or pork, so I can only eat chicken, turkey or vegetarian hotdogs.  My friend John and I were on our way to meet our friend to go bowling and I decided to stop by Maui Dogs and Slider. \n\nThey  just had a soft opening, but I wanted to review them right away so people can find out about this place. \nThe atmosphere, is very hawaiian and they have all kinds of   fruit relish with different   combination of mango, coconut, pineapple or banana. They have  a signature mustard being flavored with passionfruit. I tried their turkey hotdog with avocado and some sweet and spicy relish.It was pretty good. \nThe only way it could get better is if they had beer on tap.  Maui Dog  is definitely a winner in the wiener category!\n\nUpdate: (6/9/2011)  I've stopped eating chicken & turkey for 8 months now, so I haven't been back.
4	I have always had an excellent lunch at Ted's - not necessarily the healthiest - but excellent!  It is easy to be intimidated in front of the lunch crowd when the cook is asking for your order across a line of hungry patrons - but it keeps the line rolling, and you get your food fast (without it quite being such fast food!).  All the dogs I've had there were excellent (never tried anything else - why would I - it's Ted's HOT DOGS!).
5	We have loyally been taking our dog to Animal Hospital at Grayhawk for more than seven years now (since our she was a puppy).  We have primarily been seeing Dr. Howard, although on a couple recent occasions we have seen his associates.  Dr.  Howard is a friendly and knowledgeable veterinarian.  We think he isn't overly conservative nor overly aggressive with treatments, and he always does a thorough job explaining treatments and options.  His staff has always been supurb and very friendly as well.  Our dog has been seen for regular exams as well as some sick visits.  Although we have only seen his associates a couple times, we actually had one call to see how our dog was doing on a new medication.  Very impressive!  The office is clean and comfortable and we would recommend them to anyone!
4	This place is so versatile, it's great for lunch with co-workers, a meeting, happy hour with friends, or a date night on the town.  \n\nFor some reason, I LOVE all of the soups that House of Tricks has to offer.  I think this place has the best soup in the valley.  Random, perhaps, but give it a try! \n\nI like that they have a seasonal menu, and it changes with some regularity.  It's great to go back to a restaurant you enjoy and you find new and exciting food options to choose from. \n\nWorking in Tempe, I've gone here for work lunches a few times.   I definitely recommend the French Dip - melts in your mouth, so flavorful!  Or...my other go-to is the Grilled Chicken sandwich with goat cheese.  You had me at goat cheese....   On the dinner menu, I've tried several fish dishes - salmon and halibut are my favorites. \n\nI love that this American style menu always has some unexpected twists and turns on the menu.   Definitely worth checking out.  And with the cute house vibe and great ambiance, this place will score big points for a date night too!
2	So with all the great reviews I am almost afraid to add my poor review of this place.  We went to dinner on a Sunday night and it wasn't very full but I can't imagine the wait if it was.  It's a very tiny restaurant and the tables are really close to each other.  So much so that we had trouble holding our own conversation because the table next to us was so loud that we heard every part of their conversation.  The food took forever to get to our table and when it did.  Honestly, it was okay.  I think for the price and location I just expected more.  Maybe, I need to come back for the happy hour menu.  I heard the happy hours are awesome but then again if you are drinking who needs tastebuds?
1	"""Anyone reading this, or any one of the other Yelp reviews for Fiorella's Ristorante, should do the following:\n\n1. Note the disparity in reviews: either five stars, or one. Inconsistency at best!\n2. Next to each review, note the date of review.\n3. Anyone who says they are from Sicily, Italy, Philly, Chicago, are of Italian heritage, or believe they know \good\"""" Italian food from \""""bad\"""" AND give this place more than one or two stars, is full of shit and lying because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.\n\nFor the record, Sicilians don't eat CREAM sauces. That's part of northern Italy cuisine. And you're hard pressed to find menu items at Fiorella's that doesn't have an alfredo or cream component to their sauces. Naturally, I opted for basic spaghetti & meatballs ($12) while my girlfriend chose the spaghettini pomodoro al fresco ($9). Here's what we got:\n\n* A sticky table. Across the ENTIRE surface.\n\n* A garlic bread bowl with very little garlic flavor, served without olive oil, balsamic vinegar, oregano, pepperoncino (red pepper flake), or even butter.\n\n* A paltry serving of spaghetti with a minimum of a bland marinara, and meatballs that were nothing but balls of boiled meat -- they were dripping wet, with no seasoning, no breadcrumbs, cheese, mint, oregano, or anything at all -- just plain, boiled meat in a ball shape. Seriously?\n\n* A bowl of spaghettini with so little oil as to be dry to the touch, served \""""al fresco\"""" with barely a shred of semi-fresh (cooked?) basil, not even half a roma tomato worth of diced tomato, VERY little garlic, no salt or pepper, and little flavor overall. My girlfriend picked over her entree before asking if I wanted to finish it, but if I wanted to eat spaghetti so lightly dressed as to stick to itself I could do that at home for 18 cents while lounging in my underwear.\n\nThrow in a glass of Badiolo chianti ($6) and Altadonna sangiovese ($8), plus tax, and you're looking at a total of $38.25 I wasted for this meal. My girlfriend's 10 year old nephew could have done a better (read: tastier) job with a jar of Ragu and Barilla pasta for $4.29 instead of this hot mess.\n\nErin O. ate here 10 days after we did, and she sums it up best when she says \""""there's nothing about this place that would make us want to return.\"""" I'm amazed that anyone -- ANYONE -- could think this is even mediocre Italian cuisine, let alone \""""good\"""", based on an absolute dearth of flavor. For what little you get, and the poor quality of food, their price point is easily 20-25% higher than what it should be.\n\nGood service will not cover for bad food, just as bad service will not cover for good food. But at least with bad service, you still can feel like dinner was a win. This iplace is an utter disappointment."""""""
3	"""This Culver's location just opened up in my neighborhood so I ventured in.  The entire staff was working.  They were completely over staffed.  I guess it is better to be safe than sorry for a grand opening.  There was not a line so I walked right up to the cashier and ordered a Deluxe Double Burger.  I was up sold from fries to cheese curds.  I asked the cashier were this business started and she told me Wisconsin.  She tried to sell me custard too.  I said no.  I took my number, went to the soda fountain and filled my cup with Culver's own Root Beer.  I sat down and waited for my burger and cheese curds.  Of course the place was clean, it is brand new.  (Lets see if it stays that way)  They have a large flat screen that was playing sports.  The walls had Biblical quotes from Proverbs.  Am I in the banquet hall from the church next door?  I quickly looked under my cup to see if there were anymore quotes.  No quotes.  It did have a question though.  \What flavor are you?\""""  Gee!! I don't know, Spicy Mexican maybe.  My burger came and it was wet with oil or butter or water.  It was juicy.  Not a bad burger but not great.  The cheese curds were nice.  I like cheese, and the fact that it is battered and deep fried is all the more sinful.  My arteries were screaming at me and saying \""""why are you eating this?\""""  I enjoyed the Root Beer.  I went for a refill on my way out.  The total for my meal was $7.79.  I will go back to Culver's but not often.  My craving for cheese curd will have to kick in for me to go back.  A-OK."""""""
4	You can't go into places like these looking for something specific.  It's the nordstrom rack of nordstrom racks.  There are GREAT deals and a ton of crap.\n\nSocks/tights for $1.  Tank tops for 2-3.  COLE HAAN SHOES FOR 13. CHARLES DAVID SHOES FOR 15.  Sorry, I had to caps those because that's just ridiculous!!! \n\nI think the shoes is probably the best bet with everything. Most seemed to be in pretty good condition and were pretty well organized and easy to sort through... Racks of clothing can be hard and there's lots of stuff with holes, marks, discolorations...\n\nEither way, I'm glad I finally stopped by this place.  Been meaning to for the past couple years and I walked away with 2 pairs of shoes, 7 tank tops, a shirt, 5 pairs of socks/tights and underwear for under 60 bucks.
5	Lowes is so much nicer than Home Depot, customer service always seems better too. I think it's annoying that Home Depot always builds a location near Lowes in an effort to put them out of business, they have done this at Thunderbird & I-17 and this location as well. Most of Lowes products are usually better, I found this out with garden hoses. I bought a high end commercial grade hose from each store & Lowes carries this great black, non-kink hose that is awesome. I ended up throwing the one from home depot out since it was junk. I have also noticed on a few items that Home Depot is slightly higher on prices. My favorite thing about Lowes though is the fact that it's always easier to find someone to help you.
1	This place is a dive. Booked through Priceline since it was rated 3.5 stars (should have been 1 or 2).  I would rather stay at a Motel 6. All of the furniture was cheap, second hand, and all dinged up. The bathroom had paint peeling off the ceiling, was apparently painted by some cheap help, and had a plywood board coming loose from the wall that was apparently some handyman's solution for a clean-out cover. Even the outside gave the appearance of a sleazy motel that someone tried to put lipstick on. When I complained, they would not let me out of my 3-night stay since I had prepaid through Priceline. The place is a sham and not even worth half of the 65% discounted rate that I paid. Steer clear!
3	I probably would not have come here however my daughter's school had a fundraiser here and I like to go and support the school. The jungle themed decor seemed to be very appealing to all the kids.  It was not your run of the mill night in the restaurant.  I will say that our server was very pleasant and helpful.  I asked what she reccomended and she gave me a few suggestions.  I opted for the macadmia crusted mahi mahi.  My daughter had a rice bowl.  Everything came out quickly and piping hot.  I must say my fish was delicious.  And the portion was quite generous.  My daughter loved her rice bowl.  She got ice cream with her meal also.  Overall they appeard to be doing a great job with the amount of people that were there.  I saw food come out pretty quickly and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  Would I came back?  They offer a $5 off coupon if you sign up for their e-club.  My daughter loved the decor and she asked if we could go back sometime so ya, we probably will.
4	OH YES! It's hard to find these restaurants in Arizona.  There are 3 signs of good Chinese food. \n1. Washed out pictures of their food.  Reason: Word of mouth keeps the place going.  They haven't taken pics of their food since they opened cause it's that damn good!\n2. A collaboration of tacky golden items.  This place has the Buddah.  \n3.  A huge a** fish tank of exotic fish.  \nYESSS!\nOh but this place is classy; it has a piano, and a 24 hour player! \nI don't know about the dim sum...I was there for actual food.  Everything was so good, only drawback was the check :0! Worth the 60 bucks!  can't complain though, I took half of it home.
1	"""What?  LOL, this place is HELL.  Back in my hometown of Chicago, this is where all the My-New-Haircut-Guys would gather to act like they had culture because they were slamming Sake-Bombs and butting chests together.\n\nI had a taste for sushi, it was on my way... I peeked inside and thought to myself, \This can't be as bad as it looks.\""""  Oh, yeah it can.  Note to the owners:  no, you cannot have BOTH a hip little sushi restaurant AND a sports bar.  It's loud, it's crowded, I had vegetable maki and it STILL smelled like old fish.  It's cheap, I'll give them that.  But if I had to deal with this place again, a chop stick would end up going through a baseball cap and into a skull."""""""
1	"""We looked at the food before deciding to sit down and it looked like it would be pretty good. Looks can be deceiving because NOTHING was good. I mean nothing -- usually there is at least one dish that you can eat to get your money's worth and there was literally nothing. The fried shrimp must have been over-fried by like 10 minutes it was so tough and chewy, the sweet and sour chicken had unidentifiable meat in it that was such a weird texture it made me gag. None of the meats were good, anything that was fish was too fishy, the rice and noodles were dried out. And everything smelled like old grease and had similar flavors. The soda pops we got also tasted \off\"""".  We were very disappointed for $50 as we left hungry and went to McDonald's.\n\nThe waitress was very nice, cleared dishes quickly and was very attentive.  She brought my son potatoes that were not on the buffet since we couldn't find anything he would eat, so the people are nice and I wish I could say something nice about the food but I can't."""""""
5	Our daughter made a reservation at The Capital Grille N Scottsdale to celebrate our 25th Anniversary and it also happened to be Restaurant Week. When we arrived and were seated we were pleasantly surprised with a decorated table with confetti hearts and rose petals and a good wishes card.\nThe server Gina was so friendly and gave us great service, we decided to order from the set menu for the restaurant week and the food was excellent, the french onion soup was hot and delicious, the filet mignon was cooked as I ordered and very tendered as the cream of spinach and mashed potatos had good flavor. The drinks were also well made. All in all they gave us a great anniversary experience and we will return for another one.
5	Great shop, great easy vibe great artists. Got my first tattoo today and I did a lot of research before deciding on the Lady Luck! Yelp was a great help in my decision and after the reviews I read I had to check out the shop myself. Loved it. Very easy going. As a first timer I felt very comfortable. Jet did my tattoo and he was great! So easy to work with and very talented!! It turned out amazing and I am sold on this place! I will be going back! I highly recommend  this shop for your next tattoo! Ask for Jet! :-)
2	Chances are you will have a nice meal here but I feel the meal I had was one star worthy. I am giving two stars because my husbands meal was fine and the dining room manager tried to fix.\n\nWe decided to try for Saturday Lunch and I thought the chicken wrap plate might be nice since the menu described it with jicama and pecans with chipotle mayo. The meals came out and my plate looked pretty but I sort of knew I wouldn't like it when I saw the wraps were filled with lots of Mayo ( seriously one third , the wraps were standing up on the plate like towers ) and to make it worse they were standing on a large amount of chipotle mayo ( you were expected to dip your mayo wrap into mayo) . This plate came with a nice side of salad so I knew I could eat that. I choose to eat it because I knew my husband was starving and wouldn't eat unless I did. I ate the side salad and it was good I took a bite into the wrap and the contents spilled out onto the chipotle mayo pool that was on my plate. I didn't notice any jicama and only saw a few crumbs of pecans in it but it did have a few chunks of cucumber in it . I ate half the wrap and was finished AND NOW MY WAITER CHECKS ON US. I told him about the mayo problem and he offered to get me something else and I say I ate already and don't want more food. Then the dining room manager comes over and offers to get me something else and I say that's not necessary since I ate already. The dining room manager sees my leftover half wrap and suggest that I can enjoy the other half of my wrap latter if I just add extra chicken to it and offers to box it for me with some extra chicken. We received the extra chicken and it was hot chicken.\n\nI just have to say this was an awful recipe for chicken salad or perhaps the recipe wasn't followed?
1	"""RACIST BIGOT OWNER!!!\n\nRacism or making fun against any group of people is unbelievable.  However, MR. Wonderful Wanda thinks it is ok.  Look at the menu.  They have an item labeled \Redneck Bendict\"""".  I was there for breakfast recently because my girlfriend was hungry.  We noticed the offensive, racist, prejudicial verbiage and, respectfully, told the wife of the owner we found it offensive.  She said nothing initially.  Later, she apologized for her husband (the owner of Wonderful Wandas).  My girl and I paid our bill, provided a tip and left.  \n\nUpon the next visit, requested by my girlfriend, we were abrupbly told to leave the restaurant by the owner because we were \""""rude\"""" according to Mr. Wonderful Wanda.  We were dumbfounded.  He told me to take my \""""yellow bitch\"""" and never come back.  I refrained from breaking his face and drove down the street to The Good Egg.  Excellent food at the Good Egg by the way.  \n\nMy girlfriend is Asian (Laotian) and she was very offended.  So if you are a proponent of bigots, racists, horrible service, an outhouse bathroom nestled in the anals of the kitchen, average food, cramped surroundings and unattractive servers that never smile; please solicit Wonderful Wandas!\n\nIf not, go somewhere else.  Google \""""Redneck\"""".  It is dorogatory, racist and wrong.  Please do not support such a pathetic establishment."""""""
5	I am a Huge fan! I love a place where you can get some peanuts while you wait for your food. They use peanut oil to cook their food as well. \n\nThis place is clean, friendly, and good food. What else can you ask for? \n\nI am a fan of In N out, I think they have fresh burgers too. BUT this place blows them out of the water. The burgers are cooked right there in front of you, the ingredients are always fresh and good, I love the sign telling you where their potatoes came from today. \n\nA simply menu that can be extraordinary. You can hand pick whatever you want on your burger at no extra charge. My choice is grilled onions bacon and cheese.
4	The Fox food empire has done it again.  With the demise of the Pink Taco (who could have forecasted that???) and their recently-emptied location, Culinary Dropout moved in to offer great American food at reasonable prices.  \n\nThe menu is fairly limited, but with multiple iterations of cheeseburgers, very good fries, and great appetizers, there are more than enough options for the casual diners who find themselves on the Water Front.  Even though the burger and the fries were very good, I found the appetizers to be the best part of the meal.  There is an impressive assortment of meats and cheeses, so you can customize your own tapas if that is what you're into.  If you're not in the mood for a meat-and-cheese appetizer, the pretzel fondue is definitely worth a shot.  The homemade pretzels were awesome and the cheese dip puts traditional nacho cheese to shame.  \n\nI ended up at the restaurant on a random Wednesday night and the place was packed.  I feel pretty comfortable saying that given the good drink list, and affordable good food, you should expect to wait for a table unless you like to eat dinner early.
4	"""Dear LGO, I may have yelped too soon with my first review.  I know you can't control the \angry birds\"""" that are in your patio, but you can try to control customer perceptions and satisfaction.  And of course that's what you did.  You tried to make it right and I came back with a more pleasant experience.  \n\nSecond time around: We scored an awesome parking spot in the front, there were seats inside, and the food was pretty good.  The hot-pressed tuna had too much pepper, but the desserts were oh-so-good.\n\nYou are the example of what other small businesses should strive for - customer satisfaction. Thank you for taking the time to make me a fan."""""""
2	Extremely disappointing.  We waited two hours to receive a farmers market salad that had little more than a couple pieces of  blue cheese and onion we could have made at home, as well as a pizza that tasted like rubber.  We ordered the margarita pizza and tried to be polite and eat with fork and cut with knife, but it was like cutting rubber.  The crust was not finished and the pizza was less than par.  The table next to us was filled with screaming patrons who sat there a good 45 minutes after they signed their check.  It was completely not worth the wait.  Waste of time and a complete let down.  Don't waste the time, it is not worth it.
3	Gallagher's is a-ok with me! I've visited Gallagher's on several occasions and it's your average neighborhood pub. I don't think the food is AMAZING but it's good and washes down nice and easy with a cold beer! The cookie with ice cream is YUMMY. I love the peanut butter cookie. It's amazing and can easily be shared by a couple people. \nThe thing they might fall a bit short on is service. I'm not saying service is horrible, but it's not highly attentive all of the time. It can really be hit or miss. Another issue is if you set by the back patio, all the smoke from outside gets sucked inside whenever someone opens that door. Maybe one of those blowers that is activated every time someone opens the door would cut back on the smoke entering the bar? Just a thought. \n\nOverall I like Gallagher's it's a great place for some bar food and few beers.
5	We stopped in for lunch and really enjoyed the vegan burger, but added real cheese. It was great and so was the salad that came with it.\nWe also ordered coffee and a delicious dirty chai.\n\nService was very friendly and helpful with all of our questions. The chef was willing to prepare a dish that was not on the current menu, but did appear on the website. We ordered the Savory Napolean, which is a puff pastry filled with two (or more) fillings that can also be ordered in crepe or omelet form. It was quite good, although we did add a bit of salt. It would also probably be better with a more sharp cheese.\n\nWe ended the meal with a praline & chocolate macaroon, which we really enjoyed. We also took home one of the chocolate & peanut butter mousse for dessert later.\n\nA lot of other reviews mention the cost and I was a little surprised at the price of the macaroon, but really the food was reasonable and so was the coffee. If you want cheap food, then you should probably go somewhere else, but in a town with so many chains I will gladly pay a little more to frequent a small business with a nice atmosphere.
2	"""I am not sure I went to the same place as all the other reviews due to the fact nothing is fantastic here except Pavle the server. He was funny, kind and attentive. \n\nSix of us came here for a late night dinner. We ordered several different things on the menu and shared. I was not impressed with one thing i tried, and most of our group felt the same way. The blossoms were luke warm and over fried. The salame sandwich which was described as cheesy goodness barely had any cheese on it. I ordered the butterscotch pudding which was described as \to die for, people rave about it\"""". The pudding was gritty, chalky tasting and not good at all. \n\nThe best thing that several of us enjoyed was the random cookie that came with the sandwich. This should not be the case. \n\nPavle was so kind and took the dessert of my tab. The service was great but for the price and the taste of food, I will not be returning to FnB"""""""
4	I've eaten at this location twice and have enjoyed both visits. I've had the prime rib which was cooked to perfection and a sirloin with lobster and shrimp special. The lobster and shrimp where in a sauce that was a little too salty. The crowd here is generally in the late 40's+ so don't expect a cool hip vibe from this place. It's quiet and dark with a lot of warm colors, which I like for a steak place. The service has always bene excellent. The waiters are attentive but not intrusive. \n\nWe signed up to receive a free dinner on our birthdays and I got the voucher for a free prime rib dinner with a potato and salad to be used Monday - Thursday anytime during the month of my birthday, yesterday. Woo hoo!
2	I had heard good things about this place from friends so I decided to try it out.  I ordered 2 burgers, fries, and a soda.  It cost me 17 dollars!!!!  That is very high for a burger.  I'm not really sure if this place is considered fast food, but compared other burger places I frequent it was definitely the most expensive.  I built my own burger, and I like my burgers pretty simple.  The burger was disappointing though, size was good for a single patty, but I could probably have gotten a double for the same price at any other place.  The actual patty was pretty bland, the rest of the toppings and bun were pretty good, but without a good patty they can only go so far.  The fries were also kind of bland.  They were advertised with rosemary and garlic on them.  I've had good garlic fries and these were nowhere close, I got a faint hint of garlic, not a wake up all my senses amount of garlic that I was hoping for.  Overall the price was the real killer.  If I could have gotten my order for 5 dollars less I would consider going back, but there are better burgers out there for less money.
2	"""The ponytail guy who runs this place seems totally cool and you get the feeling that this place is totally white friendly. When you order though, you realize it is past white friendly and any self respecting Vietnamese person would be ashamed by this place. \n\nMy nem nuong quon was brought by some cold sore yielding individual who overcharged me by about 50 cents for my rolls, and the \nice\"""" guy who seemed like he owned the restaurant acted like a dick when I ordered."""""""
3	this place was okay, going to give it another chance to really decide. Atmosphere is pretty cool, you feel comfortable soon as you walk in..seat yourself place. After we placed our orders one of the two pastys we ordered had ran out which kinda sucked. checked out the alcohol menu and seemed to have a large variety, and good deals for happy hour as well. food was okay, had the Alfredo pasty and the spicy asiago chicken. Was not anything that knocked my socks off, but it satisfied the hunger. like i said will probably give it another chance and try something else and def give the desert a chance because they look delicious!
3	Wings! You can get them any way ya like and order more on wing Tuesday!!  I like the honey bbq and the pinapple teriyaki.  YUMMY.  Some co workers and I hit this place last Tuesday.  We had 5 in our party and we were seated right away.  Service was good, drinks were refilled, and the bill was brought promptly.  Thats great during lunch hour because time is of the essence to get back to work.  The interior could use a little sprucing up at this site but it's fine for lunch or a quick bite.  Probably a hopping place during football season too.
4	BLACK FRIDAY 2012 ROTD Baby!!!\n\nIf you like green chiles, they have bags of roasted ones at the checkout.  Pick one up and smell it.  What an amazing aroma.  Now buy it !!!  Because I don't want to come in and pick up a bag, knowing your nose germs (and who knows what else) are all over the outside of the bag.\n\nThey also consistently have great ripe avocados.  Wish I could say the same for Sprouts, who typically sells avocados that could break windows.\n\nStop by the juice counter and get a strawberries and cream, horchata, or possibly watermelon juice.\n\nBut the real reason I come here is twofold.  The first reason is the meat counter, which is where they keep the ranchera steak.  Oh yeah, have them add the marinade and let it sit overnight.  The second reason is the hot food counter.  Best refried beans I've had in a while.  While you're there, pick up a tub of their freshly made salsa, and some hot tortillas.
3	I found myself in downtown Scottsdale one evening after a long day at work. Extremely tired and way hungry, I started scanning for my options, and locked eyes on Pita House, because, well, I can never get enough of Middle Eastern food. \n\nPita House is arranged in an odd way - there are small plastic tables on the asphalt out in front, which means you'd be eating in the actual parking lot, and small tables on the side, where in the back is a hookah bar with no one tending it nor anyone sitting there. Very empty and I'm a little doubtful if it actually fills up later in the evening. But at least they had Arabic pop music playing, which, I guess, is something better than nothing.\n\nI didn't want to eat too heavy and greet folks I was meeting up with later half-asleep, so I just ordered the chicken kebab sandwich. I then sat on the side patio and hung out. My sandwich came about 5 minutes later and I'll first begin with the minuses:\n\n* The Salad: I hate all that Costco shredded iceberg lettuce crap that so many places use as their side salad. If I want cole slaw, I'd go to KFC. This salad was extremely unremarkable. Bah.\n* The Pita: It was cold and not all that special. Having the pita warmed up as well would have been a good touch.\n\nAnd now the pluses:\n\n* The Actual Chicken: Excellent. The seasonings were really tasty and the chicken was grilled just right - maintaining its juices and not drying out. I would have preferred to eat a plate just of full of these chicken pieces and nothing else. I think I'll get it as a plate special next time around. \n* Service: Very friendly and efficient, even though it was only one girl who was doubling as both the cashier/kitchen manager and the server. \n\nSo three stars for now. More if I make it back for more meals and become impressed with the other stuff. But if you are in the neck of the woods and are looking for a decent, casual ethnic eating option that won't break the bank, try it out. I'd go back.
3	If you stay at the Crowne Plaza, as I did for a sales meeting, chances are you'll have a chance to wander the nearby streets. This is a corner bar, next to the resort. It's kind of unavoidable.\n\nThe SanTan is a microbrew bar and restaurant. The food is tasty. Appetizers are big enough to share, so do share! \n\nI ordered a salad that was really a salad... It had a lot of good greens and tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, and croutons. \n\nTheir specialty burgers are great. I had an Aegean Burger (stuffed blue cheese burger) that was wonderful for a hamburger. The fries are awesome and too plentiful.\n\nMy only complaint about this place is the sound level! Between the sound of the kitchen, the TV, the live guitarist playing Cat Stevens oldies, and the voices of the crowd (every seat was filled), you could barely hear the person sitting next to you if (s)he shouted. \n\nAlthough we didn't sit outside, they do have tables and heaters in the winter. \n\nI give the place three and a half stars for food and beer, two stars for the overall ambience. Stop in if you like loudness.
3	"""Hello, I have very average food, lackluster presentation, servers with minimal to zero personality, a boring menu, slow service, and I was probably a lot better 10 years ago but lost the will to live, who am I?\n\nSam's Cafe.\n\nI was hoping for a better experience and review, however it was just Meh, hey I have never used that term before so here it goes again: Meh!\n\nWent for lunch on a Sunday, I think they were short staffed because there was no one to greet and no busboys, the servers bussed their own tables.  Attractive chain restaurant, but I got the feeling the employees weren't the happiest.  I overheard the lady at the next table ask for her stuff to go and the cigarette voiced, and been -a --waitress way- too- long-server  said: \I don't have time to box it for you, but I can give you the container.\""""  It wasn't even busy!!  Weak.  They sure wouldn't do that at the Cheesecake factory which should have been my first choice in that area.\n\nThe food was mediocre, dull, it was OK.  Nothing at all to write home about.  I did like the deep fried assortment of chips with the bland Pace-like salsa, that was good.  We ordered two forgettable pasta dishes, yawn.... And the white chocolate tamale parting gift was good, only one of them was still frozen!  Yikes!!\n\nThe bathrooms were not very clean and by the bathroom I spotted framed \""""Best of\"""" kind of things from the AZ Republic, dated 1997!!  I think maybe then it was fresh and better but those are days long gone by.  I won't be back.  \n\nOh our waitress filled my iced tea X3 which was good but never checked on us after we got our meal, not so good.  She was bland like the food and the whole overall expression of that Establishment.  I would not be surprised to go back there in 6 months to see it closed.  Better restaurants have closed, Sam's Cafe needs an extreme personality and menu makeover.  \n\nI should have gone to the Cheesecake Factory....."""""""
4	I had dinner here last week and loved the food.  I had red snapper in a crunchy crust, mashed potatoes, veggies, watermelon salsa.  This was not on the menu as it was their special of the day.\nNow, I know many people will question the watermelon salsa but I love different salsas which are very hard to find anywhere in the AZ area.  I have had pineapple, papaya, mango, and many other fruit based salsas but never had the watermelon before.
1	Don't go!!!  Tony's WAS the best shoe repair.  There are NEW owners who can not be trusted.  You have to pay in advance and their prices have really gone WAY UP!  They give you a little 'pink card' with your number as a receipt.  If you don't have your little pink card - good luck!!  They have no way of finding your shoes.  Their work is POOR, they are rude and their prices are crazy.  The good reviews for Tony's are old - NOT for these new owners.
4	What i love about this store is how it caters to filipino goods. Instead of an aisle reserved to filipino products and goods this place has it all over the place. Some of the stuff they sell here are cheaper than Lee Lee and their produce selection is extensive and in an organized and clean setting. \n\nThe drawback of this store is the rice selection which isn't as varied as well as the beer too. Lee Lee has all kinds of Asian lagers, this store lacks the San Miguel dark lager. Nevertheless there's still a good selection. The fish here is just as good as Lee Lee though and it's nice to get the packaged smoked eel and the seaweed salad. Unlike other Asian grocery stores this one has piped in music, and organized aisles. Overall this place is worth shopping at and can compete with Lee Lee.
5	As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale, the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch. At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio. Other than the ambiance, the food is some of the best fresh local food I've tasted. A personal favorite is the Free Range Chicken with Goat Cheese... Can you say tasty? My mouth waters just thinking about it. Walking in, the crew at the Herb Box is some of the friendliest you'll ever meet (and the funniest). When you go, make sure to save room for dessert... the cheesecake of the moment is always a win!
5	"""Super owner who loves his customers, I saw this bitch in there giving him a hard time while I was there and I wanted to rip into her. Now where else would you see customers so protective of a local restaurant owner if it weren't so good?\n\nBest orange chicken ever, the sauce actually tingles your tongue and it doesn't taste generic. His wife actually uses real oranges and it is so refreshing. The miso soup is so good and filling as are their rice bowls. They use very beautiful pearl rice in their rice bowls not just regular long-grain rice here. The Japanese very much value the quality of the rice and it shows here.\n\nThe owner asked me specifically if the food was good because as he put it to my partner, \I always ask the woman if the food is good because they would know better about good quality food.\"""""""""""
5	"""Very cute little shop in a nondescript location. The inside is super cute, bright, colorful, and cheery. I love the fact that they sell a lot of their homemade candies, marshmallows, cookies etc.  and they are all displayed and packaged very nicely. Now on to the ice cream! The selection of flavors is varied, but not overwhelmingly huge like a lot of places can be. They have sorbets on one side of the counter, and their ice creams on the other. I didn't try any of the sorbets, but they looked great. While the menu had a ton of great looking sundaes to choose from, I ended up creating my own. I got a scoop of the espresso, and salted butter caramel with salted caramel sauce,  toffee butter crunch, whipped cream, and a toasted marshmallow to top it off! The blend of flavors all together was excellent. Individually the components of the sundae were even better. You can tell the ice cream is handmade, quality stuff. The espresso was smooth, and the salted butter caramel my favorite, though I didn't quite taste the \salted\"""" part that much. The toffee butter crunch was definitely one of my favorite parts of the sundae, and I could have probably just eaten a bag of that. The salted caramel sauce complimented the ice cream and was super tasty. The grand finale of the toasted marshmallow made for a great presentation, though it was difficult to eat in conjunction with the ice cream, and I actually ended up taking it off and eating it separately.  It could have been toasted more, but that would obviously have made the ice cream underneath it melt even more than it started to. I will definitely be coming back here and trying more things. I did also try a sample of the honey blue cheese, and it was tasty and unique, but not something I could eat a whole scoop of!"""""""
3	This place claims NY style pizza however the pizza is undercooked unless you ask them to make it well done. this pizzas here take a very long time to cook, and there is no by the slice option on weekends.  In addition to pizzas of various types there are calzones and standard Italian fair all at fairly low prices. \n\nThe sauce is not too sweet, the cheese is decent when well done but the crust is lacking with the pizza. It is nice to see granulated garlic a standard condiment on the tables as it helps to add some much needed flavor.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and it is a sit down style dining on night and weekends. During the day one has the option to get a quick meal from the pickup counter. \n\nAs pizza goes in AZ this place is better than most, however it is still far from the best pizza ever.
4	The food is 4 stars and the beer is more of a 3.5. \n\nThere are days when I'm starving and wishing I could drive the six hours to Phoenix and have Four Peaks for lunch. I don't know why, but the food there is tops for a brewpub. It's not super gourmet like those participating in this gastropub movement as of late, but it's solid comfort all the way. I'm particularly addicted to their beer-battered chicken tenders and their fries (seasoned wedges) are like crack. They've got decent fish and chips (although they don't hold a candle to George and Dragon) and the other stuff's good too. \n\nBeer-wise, Four Peaks doesn't make the cut on my list of favorite breweries in the country, but for Arizona, it's okay. The Kiltlifer (not to be confused with Moylan's Kilt Lifter (which rates higher on BeerAdvocate) from California, and the less popular Pike's Kilt Lifter from Seattle, seems to be their most popular brew and is a pretty standard and consistent Scotch ale with just the right amount of malt and yeast. \n\nOther offerings include their 8th Street Ale (average), Hefeweizen (below average), and their Hop Knot IPA (which is inconsistent-- sometimes it's very hoppy, sometimes it's just got no bite at all). They have a Raja IPA which is also inconsistent-- sometimes it has no difference from the Hop Knot whatsoever, but when you do get a batch that tastes different, it's a little comparable to Lagunitas'  Hop Stupid. \n\nThe Oatmeal Stout and Pumpkin Porter are laughable. Just cheap knock offs of better breweries, although the Stout does make a decent milkshake. And the Arizona Peach used to be a summer fave of mine up until I got a pint that tasted entirely of wheat...gross. \n\nIt gets packed here, but they've got tons of space and a decent happy hour. Tons of Tempe locals, but worth the visit if you're in the area. Is this the best local brewery in the greater Phoenix area? Of course...but there isn't really much competition, now is there?
4	I'm torn on whether to give this place three or four stars...the food was definitely four star good, but the value was closer to three.  Also, the coffee, not so good...you know it is not one of their premier menu items when the couple next to you is greeted by the waitresses as regulars, order without looking at the menu, yet have brought their own coffee that they picked up at Einstein's on the way in...\n\nAnywho, I had the breakfast sandwich, eggs, cheese and turkey sausage on a croissant.  It wasn't as big as I thought based on the description, but it was plenty filling, and probably kept me from gorged myself even more than I did.  On the side I got a fruit cup...what it is with places and fruit cups...there was plentiful pineapple and melon, and like two grapes.  Did I just get a bad scoop, did they have bad grapes that day, what is the deal?  \n\nJust thinking about the breakfast sandwich right now is getting me considering going back sooner rather than later (big ups to them for having a breakfast meat option that is not from a pig, btw)...so I'm giving them four stars.
5	In n Out vs. Whataburger\n\nDicks out everyone.  \n\nI've had many an argument as to the godliness of each and though I tend to stand in the In n Out camp when discussing this with my Texas friends, and contrastively with my West Coast friends, i stand firmly that each has its place near the high end of the hamburger spectrum. \n\nVisiting In n Out  for the first time is like being a drunken male in some unfamiliar La Quinta bathroom in Reseda, California.  There seem to be limited options.  \n\nBut once you get the feel of it, you realize that you can sit down to pee if you want.  You can use the towel rack to brace yourself.  You can pee in the bathtub or bypass all ration and lay in the damn tub like a newborn ... all kinds of stuff you would never do at your regular place.\n\nTreat this place like that budget hotel.  This is not your regular place, this In n Out Burger.  Be creative.  Get nasty.  Try that 3x3 Animal Style with Animal Style fries.  Grilled onions?  Throw those bitches on.  Kick down with a Neapolitan shake ... and ... use that plastic, cos In n Out takes card now.  Word.
3	Oreganoes? My second visit to the Mesa restaurant. Guess what? Chicken but I like it. It's not great; it's kinda fun but not like a merry-go-round kinda fun (that's like one of the bests next to roller coasters! Oh emm gee!). It also has a fairly horrific... I mean fairly terrific patio and a good patio goes a long *insert expletive* way. For whatever reason, maybe something to do with the damp dark basement I had to eat my dinners alone in as a wee lad after spilling a gallon of paint on the garage floor (I did it quite often. It made the garage prettier.), I would prefer to eat at a patio table over a table inside any day of the year, even an August in Phoenix metro area or a rainy day (if it's covered). This one in Mesa is covered even though the two times I've been there the weather was beautifully moderate. Another wonderful  thing about patios is... that in civilized places you can smoke however, this is Mesa. It does have a fire pit though for those cold nights when the company you're with isn't quite warm enough.\n\nThis second visit of mine I met a few friends from school who were devouring a 's-wonderful thin crusted pizza topped 's-marvelous bits of mushrooms and smothered in a 's-awful-ly nice blanket of cheese. Tasty (without and exclamation mark). The food that I've tried is fairly mediocre; not bad but not great. I mostly had a couple of Kilt Lifters while they ate their delectably edible giant frisbee. \n\nThe first time I went was with a few friends and this one dwarfish guy that reminds me of sharp pointy things and dull wit but mostly I was able to ignore Gimli because of the scrumptious Turkey Stuffed. Ordering from the menu was a bit of a sensory overload, though. That menu has stuff going on! Over here and over there and don't forget this just passed that. Egads! \n\nThe service was fair and friendly both times and the food was brought out in a timely fashion. And this most recent time we were cursin' up a storm too. It was like a brothel full of sailors on the patio that afternoon which I think the Mormon family next to us appreciated more than we did. \n\nThe food = meh\nThe patio and service = pretty good. \n\nLook! it's my first A-OK.
4	Back from a visit to AZ.. Phoenix/Carefree and a day trip to Sedona.  I have determined that Arizona should incorporate a sandwich in its state seal.  Yelp guided us to two great sandwich shops on this trip,  Each deli had its own uniqueness, \nand both worth mentioning. Arriving from the airport around 10 am local, it was lunchtime in the eastern time zone.  Found Berthas Cafe on Yelp -- a quick trip from the airport.  It is a strip mall sandwich shop but had some great reviews, all of \nwhich were 100%.   We had the Salami Pesto and Goat Cheese and the Roast beef and blue cheese sandwiches and a half order of the daily special meatball soup.  Yum, fresh veggies, quality meats, homemade pesto and great bread.  Almost could not eat the soup due to the size of the sandwiches, but it was full of homemade flavor and lots of meatballs.  Each sandwich came with a tasty cookie, which is but a sample of desserts and baked goods available.   Would definitely stop at Berthas \nCafe for the next trip to Phoenix, lots of great looking breakfast and salad items, not to mention the rest of the sandwiches.  Get there early for lunch, it seems to fill up fast.  The people were great, super friendly and helpful.  The second shop was in Sedona. check out my review of the West Side Deli.
5	OK, well I have been a lurker here on YELP for the better part of a year, and I finally made an account because I had to get this out.\n\nSHRIMP SAN REMO.  Order it, eat it, dip bread into the sauce, take it home and marry it.  It is unreal, and they will not tell me what it's made of.  Share with someone as it is VERY rich.\n\nOther highlights from the happy hour:\n\n-Shrimp cocktail w/killer cocktail sauce (very strong horseradish heat).\n-Bucket o mussels or clams\n-Clam chowder (more broth-ey than thick)\n-Great crabcake\n-Stuffed clams\n-The oysters rockefeller are excellent\n\nI mainly go for happy hour, but when having dinner here with the folks, it has always been excellent.   The bartenders are awesome and friendly, make strong drinks, and have been working here for years.  That tells you something right there.    I really think some of the reviewers before me were a bit harsh.  Best seafood in the valley, and a LOCAL business.
1	Every time I come here, its almost a full star worse than the last. Too bad, because I used to live very close. \n\nMy first experience was great because I'm a Happy Hour Junkie and they had my FIX!\n\nHalf price apps and good beers WERE the norm back then.\n\nNot anymore. Apparently my spending $50-$90 during happy hour on reduced price items here was too much for them so they changed the HH menu to a few select items, and now, not so great prices. GRRRR!\n\nIf your looking for a place that is trying to be more of a Breast-rant, then go here. Otherwise, Its just overpriced bar food with a few signature items and lacking service that can be had pretty much anywhere else.
4	Been going to this location all football season, every Sunday morning.  Service from Tish is great, she always remembers what we like and how we like it.  \nMost of the food is good, but the best thing on the menu is the Monaco Foccacia...yummm!!  The jalapeno dressing with it is delish!  The frys have skin on and are usually really greasy.  They almost seem like they are fried in dirty grease, but they taste good??  The wings are good as well.  The Sunday morning specials are great and it's always a good time.  \nThe games are all labeled on each of the TV's so you always know who's playing where, before you sit down, which is nice.  All in all, I'd say 2 thumbs up for bar food!!
4	Can you say 20% off services during your birthday? I can.\n\nDuring my stay at the W I decided to partake in some blissful relaxation as a treat to self, thank you self. The lounge and decor of the place was pretty neat. Snacks and beverages, nice and yummy. I almost want to get flooring that has a grass print in my place. Almost...\n\nMy Blissage75 was so nice. And I finally got the heat I was looking for because the shower stall in the locker room served as a steam room. Such a nice sweat just shows I miss my yoga. \n\nSo very awesome, wish I had more time. Hopefully I get to return!
4	We had a fantastic dinner here. It was our first time and wanted to try everything so we sampled...\n-crab cake appetizer\n-caesar and wedge salad\n- hong king style sea bass\n- bbq trout\n- crab fried rice\n- asparagus\n- truffled mac and cheese\n\nThe crab cake was more meat than filler. The crab in it tasted very fresh and the outside had a fantastic pan fried crunch. The salads were bigger than indicated by the waiter, we could have easily split one. The caesar had house made dressing and the leaves were fresh. The wedge was also perfectly crisp and covered in strong, delicious maytag blue cheese.\n\nMy husband absolutely loved his trout. The skin was perfectly crisp, the fish still moist and very flavorful. My hong kong sea bass was divine....a large piece of perfectly cooked bass in a light soy sauce served with ginger. I was surprised at how large both the portions were. I was expecting smaller considering we were in north scottsdale and this place isnt super cheap.\n\nThe sides were epic. I LOVE that they have the option to order a smaller sized side. I don't think I have ever had fried rice that good. The mac and cheese was creamy, the topping not drying it out. The asparagus was not overcooked. It was finished with a bit of sea salt and came with hollandaise saue. Everything was very flavorful. None of these dishes seemed to be treated as an afterthought...something thrown on the menu just because. \n\nI took one star off because I was not a fan of their bar menu. The wine list had mostly very high priced bottles, very few options for wine by the glass. I had a cocktail and it was just ok. The hostesses were a little vacant as well. Which I can never understand...you are a restaurant hostess. You are not above being nice or smiling at people coming to eat at the restaurant you work in.\n \nWe did not try dessert due to how full we were. The food was flawless, waitstaff service outside the hostess struck that balance of present but not too present. We are planning to come back soon!
4	So I returned another time for dinner and was unfortunately... disappointed. I tried the mojito and it was 'ok' but not for nearly $9. Also, the dinner menu is everything on the lunch menu plus $5- $10 for each plate. \n\nThis time I tried the Chicharonnes de Pollo and it was horribly dry. I ate one piece. My brother had a mango glazed chicken dish and it was not good either. Too sweet. \n\nI still love this place but just disappointed in the dinner prices and my selection. I will be going again but for lunch next time.
4	Wonderful Food!!!   Great atmosphere and service as well.\n\nWe recently visted Scottsdale to watch Spring Training games.    I made reservations knowing it was a busy weekend.   I had told them it was my son's birthday.   When we got there, the table had birthday decorations on it and a hand written card from the staff.   Nice Touch.   The Food . . . . my son had the boneless fried chicken.  Amazing.    I had trout which was wonderful too.   Each of our dishes were excellent.    All of us at the table have eaten at nice restaurants, but we were\nimpressed with the overall experience.\n\nWe need one in Los Angeles!\nGravett Family.
4	"""Anyone who knows me personally knows my life's philosophy is nachos. I call everything that happens nachos. Long story (See my Four Peaks Review for more info). \n\nSo I had a total nachos moment with the Dirty Dogg. I was driving around one day aimlessly as I'm wont to do and I think to myself, \Man, it's been way too long since I've seen a wet tshirt contest.\"""" I often have random thoughts about breasts. I like them. About two hours later, my buddy sends me a text saying \""""Dirty Dogg tonight, wet tshirt contest.\"""" Clearly, it was meant to be.\n\nSo I go, and it's my first time there, and I love it. It was a total sausage fest, as they say, and bikers no less. But still I saw the potential. It's really loud but it worked because bikers don't really need to speak to communicate. I assume. Even late-yuppie bikers. The bartenders are wearing too much for my taste, but I realize most people think they're appropriately attired or perhaps under-clothed. Still better than most. If I used phrases like \""""but-her-face\"""" this would apply. Fortunately for my conscience, I don't. But they were totally cool. \n\nThe music, in my opinion, was a fantastic mix of rock and country and typical club rap songs. High energy. I knew all the words. I sang along in my most sensitive yet too cool to care way. Like, under my breath, but not. And then for the power lines, at the top of my lungs. \""""...took a midnight train going anywhere!!!\"""" \n\nThe girls dancing on the bars were fun to watch. A lot of bending over and ass shaking that makes you ponder the perfection present in the bodies of such distinctly and uniquely shaped young women. \n\nDrinks were fairly priced. Strong enough, and all that. \n\nThe wet tshirt contest was totally lame, I have to say. I think I had too much hope for it. The three ladies that participated were cute and wiggled and shimmied and shook all the right parts but I was just so \""""Eh.\"""" about it. The shirts they use need to change, immediately. They are white but you could just barely make out nipple. I think they're ribbed. It was a total disappointment. And they didn't get really crazy. Didn't show anything extra. Maybe due to liquor laws. I don't know. But it just left me wanting to balance my checkbook rather than what you can imagine I wanted to want to do... \n\nSo I went to Denny's across the street and told an incredible story to my friends. It wasn't the telling that was incredible. It was the story. Perhaps sometime I'll share it with you too, friend. Thanks for reading."""""""
2	I was dining outdoors at Delux next door when I spied a glass case of cupcakes.  We thought it would be nice to pick up cupcakes and tea to enjoy back at the resort.  I had the chocolate cupcake which was not good - there was 3x the amount of icing as there was cake and it was just not an enjoyable experience.  When we ordered tea, they looked at us like we had 3 heads.  We got crappy orange pekoe tea.  They gave us these huge styrofoam cups which they only filled about 1/4 of the way.  We asked for more water of course.  Then they gave us soda cup lids and straws.  Yes, straws....for hot tea.  I get that it's a multi-purpose bakery-deli-prepared foods to go type deal but maybe they should focus on getting one thing right before trying to serve too many diverse needs.
4	"""Yum!  Cute spot, gets busy on the weekends.  Service is disinterestedly efficient, a plus in my book as I am not a talker and don't like chatty servers.  My husband favorably reviewed the bacon as \nice and crispy.\""""  I had the same omelet both times we went because it was SO DAMN GOOD!!! I got The Bird, a heavenly two egg omelet STUFFED (and they do mean STUFFED these are BIG!) with turkey, avocado, mushrooms and some kind of creamy perfection of a cheese.  I wasn't hungry again until diner after eating this.  The orange juice is good, but my husband wasn't thrilled with the coffee (he did give an approving nod to the large cream pitchers on the tables which prevented him having to go through his usual \""""more cream please\"""" routine).  The other plus point for The Breakfast Club besides the outdoor seating (a little close to a busy street  and I didn't notice any misters on those July mornings, but at least its available) is that they serve my favorite McIlhenny Co chipotle tabasco sauce, the icing on the cake, or rather the hot sauce on the omelet as it were."""""""
5	revisted this place, and honestly... it was exactly what I was looking for.  A place to kick back with some friends and have some sushi instead of deep fried everything from other places.  The sushi was well rolled, the wait staff was friendly, the chefs interact with you and if they don't, it's probably cause they're concentrating on making sushi haha.  I like how people show up at restaurants at 945 when they close at 10 and then B about it... get a life, cause obviously the chefs and their families have one.  And why are you watching monkeys masturbate anyways... sick nasty, get a life.  Eat at Sake Bombers more and maybe the chefs will invite you to chill after work.
4	A large 1 topping pizza is $14.79 plus tax and is about the same quality as freezer pizzas. So why the 4 stars? The entertainment. What you are actually paying for is a pipe organ recital (in a fun way) with imaginative, fun lighting and animated characters.\nThe noise level can be pretty intense here and indeed many families are not very good at supervising their obviously over-stimulated children. The lines can be quite long to order food, but they assign you a number which lights up on a large board so that you can return to the entertainment until your food is ready for pick up at the counter.\nA non-mall location (bonus points), easy parking, talented organists, and friendly staff. This place will delight your children and the inner child in you.
4	Excellent. \n\nReally, there isn't much to say. Carly's is a small bistro, offering an excellent beer and drink selection, along with your typical bistro fare, including wraps, sandwiches, salads, and some appetizers. \n\nI met with a group of designers from around the valley to have drinks and some food. I enjoyed the Cuban sandwich, the filling of ham, turkey, pickle, and cheese, with a course grained mustard was very tasty, however, for a Cuban sandwich, the bread was a little too hard and thick for my tastes.  When I eat a Cuban sandwich, I expect a crunchy outside with a soft inside. However, the freshly fried potato chips were a great surprise, but I would have appreciated more of the sweet potato ones.\n\nAll and all, it's a great place, and I'll be going back, but my slight qualms take away that extra star.\n\nPrices are moderate, with food running around $6-$11, and drinks running from $2.50 specials to $8 for beers. Hit up the happy hour, and the art/music is an excellent combination.
5	My lovely lady introduced me to this spot on our First official Date. \nI love it. It's intimate, cozy and serves good, solid beer. \n\nAll of the times I've been, the servers have been courteous, warm and knowledgeable. They've explained in detail their beer specials, where it's brewed, what style it is, etc. \nThe sitting areas make it easy to get comfort and get lost in conversation. The place is fairly quiet for such a small place. \nThe prices are fair  and they offer a small, yet satisfying bar menu. \n\nI look forward to spending more nights at the Roos (as I call it) with my girl. It made for a great first date.
3	I have to give this place a thumbs up and an A-OK rating. I went last night for dinner with some girlfriends and while it was enjoyable nothing was mind blowing about this place. I'd go back but I am not chomping at the bit to go. \nThe set up is cool and relaxed, excellent atmosphere for a gathering of friends. Nothing that stuck me as interesting or unique. Just nice. Our waitresses were super nice and kept us happy without bugging us too much. They made the visit enjoyable. \nFood was good. Again, nothing bad by any means but nothing that I will be dreaming about for days. We ordered a cheese fondue to start and it was pretty delish. Melted brie cheese with cauliflower, broccoli, apples, 1/2 a salt pretzel, and some bread to dip. This by far was my favorite thing I ate. If I go back, I will get this. I ate the chicken sandwich with fries which was good. Nothing to go crazy over but for sure good. My girlfriends had the sliders and a tuna melt. Same rating for theirs sandwiches. It is worth mentioning that their sandwiches come with fries and they are pretty delightful. Another friend ordered the bruchetta and while she said it was good, she also mentioned it didn't compare to Postino's bruchetta... \nTo drink everyone else had different wines which they enjoyed, but I had a glass of sangria. It was nice and fruity, if you like sangria I recommend it. \nEver see 10 Things I Hate About You? Remember when she says I know you can be overwhelmed and I know you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed? The Living Room left me feeling just whelmed.
1	"""This place is a must see on the casual bar tour of Scottsdale. Enjoy yourself at the bar or sitting in the high pit in the back. Atmosphere is a little shaky at first, don't get their too early or it will kill your beginning evening buzz. The bartenders knocked off a star. It seemed as though one bartender was really fantabulous while the otherone was a little off his game. But I digress. Give these guys a shot, because I know I will. \nDrinks were great, best dirty martini I have had since I started the \Dirty\"""" path. They also had Johnnie Walker Black which was a nice change from the usual Red Label. \nTVs mounted on the wall can keep your boyfriend busy or some foreign guy you are trying to avoid. Smoking inside and there is a cute bar outside for those who crave the outdoors, :)\nLike I said before this place is great for your tour of Scottsdale bars  \nCatch yourself enjoying a good time at Drinx!\n\n***I  must amend my first review. Remember I said I would go back only because of the awesome bartender? Well, we wandered into Drinx for a Friday night of Girls Night Out. I had 6 total BEAUTIFUL, Drop Dead Gorgeous Girls with me. The wonderful bartender loved our group and was treating us very well with drinks and mixing up a storm. Apparently there was a miscommunication with the new bartender who relieved his shift, this miscommunication lead to one of my BEAUTIFUL girlfriends becoming upset and storming out of the bar. \nWhat is my whole point in this? The not very cool or very businesslike general manager of the establishment made our group assume responsilbiity for the special treatment we were receiving. Excuse me?? She had no idea about good customer service or customer retention!! Good LUCK Drinx, I hope you can manage to keep business, because we aren't going back!!!!!"""""""
5	I love this place!  We ordered everything that was featured on Diner, Dives and Drives.  I know what you're thinking, what groupies we are?  Couldn't help it.\n\nOnion rings were great, even the next day as I nuked them up in the toaster oven. \n\nYou must try the garlic fries.  I simply could not have enough of the garlic fries.  I'd be happy if I can just have the garlic fries, next time.  \n\nMy husband loved the fontina burger. \n\nI liked the ahi sandwich, but I wish it was a bit more rare.  It said 'rare' on the menu but it not the sushi kind of rare (barely grilled on each side kind of rare).  It's a tad more cooked than to my liking.  The asian coleslaw is not your typical kind of coleslaw.  They add a very nice touch to it, making it light, with a slight asian flavor, but the maker is the mild wasabi mayo.  The mayo simply put, is the BOMB!!\n\nThe pizza was also good, could have used a little bit less of the bbq sauce.\n\nWe'll definitely be back!
5	There is nothing I don't like about St. Francis. It makes me feel good all over and is one of the only restaurants I'd actually refer to as sexy. A chic and cozy interior, fantastic music rotation and lovely beverage choices all of which provide for a dark and steamy evening out whether it's with the girls or on a date.\n\nThe food is quite something. As much as I restrain myself at the average eating establishment when it comes to bread, St. Francis is different. To not eat the bread and olive oil is to deny yourself a mouthful of fluffy pleasure only found on the other side of the Atlantic. The flatbreads are scrumptious and don't even get me started on those fingerling potatoes. They crunch to perfection and hardly need the dipping sauces that accompany.\n\nTo be honest, I've never been impressed with the service. But I'm still giving them 5 stars. Their happy hour is one of the best in Phoenix and they have enough going on for them that as long as the mediocre service isn't disrupting my enjoyment of a glass of wine, then we're good.
4	"""We fell \over easy\"""" for Over Easy!\n\nThe draw to Over Easy was the media publicity. It was one of the \""""Top 50\"""" restaurants featured in the Arizona Foothills Magazine and made the spot light, not once - but twice on Food Network.  First on the \""""Best Thing I Ever Ate\"""" for their famous waffle dog and second on \""""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\"""".\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I arrived around noon and saw a few people waiting outside.  We were in no rush, so the wait was not a problem.  I would say we waited about 20-25 minutes before a table finally opened up.  While walking to our table, I couldn't take my eyes off of the cute animal umbrellas hanging overhead (which they advertise available for purchase). \n\nReady to Order, we decided on the \""""Over Easy\"""", which is a toasted brioche with saut\u00e9ed spinach, fried egg, bacon, scallions covered in a natural sauce and the \""""Fried Chicken & Waffle\"""".  The \""""Over Easy\"""" was Ok.  I feel it would have met my standards if maybe a different bread was used? Though the The Chicken & Waffle...AMAZING! The chicken was crunchy and slightly over salted to compliment the sweet and savory waffle...but it did not end there! Luckily one of our servers noticed that we failed to read over the menu and neglected to make their \""""secret sauce\"""" for the waffles! He politely came over, grabbed a side plate and prepared it for us! He poured the maple syrup on the plate and drizzled it with hot sauce then explained how this is their signature concoction made special for this dish.  It was delightful! \n\nSeveral reviews lowered their scores due to poor service but I am happy to say that we had an attentive and entertaining experience! I agree that they could pep it up a notch but overall, they delivered!\n\nWe both left with satisfied tummies and a souvenir tee!      \n\nTIP: \nArrive early or expect a wait.\nOrder the Chicken & Waffles and don't forget the sauce!"""""""
5	I visited Pizzeria Bianco while in Phoenix a couple of years ago and I can't wait to go back. We waited in line for quite a while and gave them our name. They sent us to the little building next door and said they would call us when a table was available. The place next door is a little bar they must own. We just sat and had a drink and enjoyed ourselves. \nThey finally called us and it was totally worth the wait. The pizza was amazing. The pizza crust was the best ever and the salads were just as impressive. We tried several menu items, probable too many, and not one thing was disappointing. \nThe owner is the only person to work on the pizzas. He gets up early every morning and goes to his local suppliers and farmers and gets his ingredients for the day. You can tell by his food that he cares about what he is doing. I cant say enough good things about this place. If anyone is going to be in the Phoenix area check to see the hours and try it. Just plan on waiting and be patient.  Its well worth it.
5	"""As I am considering vegan lifestyle my friend brought me to green for dinner. Nervous about what to order (assuming it would all taste plain or even gross) I ordered off the \sides\"""" menu, a bowl of vegan chile $4- it was delicious! Served with tortilla strip chips. My friend ordered thai peanut bowl $7.50 with crispy tofu & brown rice- I had a few bites & loved it. I will order it next time we come. Veggies included squash, onion, broccoli & carrot.  Intense spicy peanut sauce packed a punch of flavor, a moderate to slightly heavy punch. We finished with kitty ditty ($5)- a soy ice cream with kit kat like homemade wafer cookie covered with dark chocolate broken into bits and the whole thing was topped with organic choco syrup and mixed together like a DQ Blizzard. Yumm.\nI was also impressed by the friendly staff & comfortable atmosphere.  very much looking forward to my next visit."""""""
3	When in the mood for bagels I go to Einstein's with my several year old yellow Einstein Brothers stainless coffee mug.  I pick up an AZ Republic and order a toasted good grains bagel with garden veggie.  I usually have the bagel in a basket by the time I get to check out or at worst when I am filling the coffee mug.  The coffee is mellower than my usual Starbucks but compliments the bagel.  Einstein's draws both the young and mature and I enjoy the ability to read the paper at my leisure either inside or outside in the morning shade.
5	Went there last week and we were very pleasantly surprised. Everything on the menu looked delicious. We had an order of onion rings to start out and they were great. Then we had a couple of steaks for dinner. The Beef Bistro Tender was rediculous. If you're getting a steak, go for this one. The price is great also. We had the New York Strip as well, but it didn't hold a candle ot the other. Avoid the strip and go for the bistro tender. They have a great selection of beers. They are devoted to using local products and making everything from scratch and it shows. We'll definitely be back.
3	I have become quite the sandwich connoisseur over the years, and thus know that not all sandwiches can be judged on the same scale.  There are tasty sandwiches and gourmet sandwiches.  Jimmy John's Tasty Sandwiches are exactly what they claim and a bit more. \n \nThe newest Tempe location is on the southwest corner of Rural and Baseline in the Whole Foods shopping center.  The service was fast and friendly and best of all they deliver....UNTIL 3AM! \n\nI ordered the Vegetarian Club (#6), and it was pretty tasty.  Not gourmet, but kinda like home cooked goodness that fills the tummy and soothes the soul.  I was super ecstatic that they even offered alfalfa sprouts! I will definitely return to try some of the signature sandwiches now that I know they can handle the basics.
1	"""UPDATE:  Within 2 hours of posting the review below,  Dickey's contacted me in order to make things right.   Well Done!    I declined their offer for a gift card, but will try their Shea location at some point.   \n\n______________________________________________________\nIn a world of liars Dickey's would be king. \n\nHaving put an ad in the AZ Republic listing a January long special of $1 BBQ pork sandwiches on Mondays I had been driving up to this location after work on Mondays to take advantage of this deal. \n\nThe Monday before last they were \out\"""" of the pork but were good enough to substitute for another meat. This Monday they decided to NOT honor their advertised special stating \""""that isn't for Arizona.\"""" Your pants sir are on fire. \n\nA. You advertised it in an Arizona specific Newspaper \n\nB. The Shea location honored the advertised special"""""""
4	First impressions? Student hang-out. Showed up around 7pm, and the interior was filled with students and their laptops, availing themselves of the free WiFi. Lots of options for both coffee and tea drinkers, especially if you have a sweet tooth. Our barista pointed out some of their candy bar themed coffee drinks, and there were easily a dozen or more. Ample outdoor seating with a smoking area for those who care to mix vices. All in all, not a bad spot, and I'm looking forward to going back and trying out their selection of baked goods as well.
3	Delicious tender salmon with a lot of flavor ($25). It had a nice, lightly breaded crust with lemon and herb, and the sides that came with it were rich and flavorful as well (buttered rice and roasted butternut squash).  A plus for Cafe ZuZu is if you check in on Yelp, you get a free glass of wine (Choice of 3 or 4 wines, listed on the check-in screen).  While the entree was delicious, the appetizer was a different matter.  We shared the ahi tuna sliders ($10), and I was surprised to see that there was no slider aspect of this appetizer, just slices of tuna with veggies.  The tuna itself was seared on the outside, but seared for too long so that the tuna was mostly cooked.  It had a light breading on the outside, but that couldn't save it from the lack of flavor.  The marinated vegetables that came as a side were more flavorful than the tuna itself!\n\nOur waitress was lethargic with taking orders, getting our orders, serving us, and getting our bill.  Also, she didn't tell us any of the specials of the day, I had to specifically ask what they were.  Maybe it was because we were a large party so tip was already included, but she provided a very disinterested amount of service.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed, with a very open feel to the floor plan.  At night, it's a bit dark and the lights give off a red hue.
4	My friend and I ended up here by accident but I'm glad we stopped by!  Service is very attentive here, and we were quickly seated.  We ordered the cheese crab puffs and the potstickers.  I'd pass on the cheese puffs, they had a bizarre flavor, that I still can't put my finger on.  The pot stickers were perfect.  I ordered the pepper beef and it was very good.  The red and green peppers were cooked just perfectly so they were not too soft or crisp and the beef was also done just right with the perfect amount of pepper sauce.  It came with white rice, which I'm not use to, since I usually have brown, but that was fine also.  Decor is fine, a little 60's china-ish but it seems to suit the place.  From the diverse crowd that was there last night enjoying themselves, it seems they agree with me.  This place is a hit.
3	Finally they have another native american eating joint on the east side!!  The one on Gilbert was great but ended up closing.  I'm not worries about the fry bread because i know it will be good.  Was more concerned on whether they would have native style stews, and boy do they!  They have about 5 different varieties from red chili stew to menudo.  I decided to try the hominy with beef, a very simple stew but this one bowl is pretty filling.  Most native style stews are pretty simple,  just beef with various vegetables and not much herbs.  But that's what makes them good!  Simple comfort food.  I plan on trying the red chili or menudo on my next visit.  They fry bread for me was okay.  You need the oil at a certain temperature for the bread to come out right.  You get a nice softness and crunch in one serving.  Mine was still a little oily in certain area but since i wasn't concerned with my diet today, i didn't mind the greasiness.  The place is quite cozy with little pieces of artwork on the walls.  Miss the nice native music that the other place had.  Can't wait to visit again.  Keep up the great work guys!!
4	"""Hungry for a great burger, I stopped in for a first visit to this particular SmashBurger this morning, to give it a try.  I ordered the 1/3 lb. Arizona Burger ($5.99) which comes with an Angus beef patty, Haba\u00f1ero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onions, spicy Chipotle sauce, mayo, & fresh Jalepe\u00f1o slices on what they call their \Spicy Chipotle\"""" bun.  Along with that I went with an order of their Haystack Onion strings ($1.99), which come with a cup of perky dipping sauce.\n\nI'm going to give this SmashBurger only 4 Stars overall because I prefer the floor plan at their Baseline & Rural location, but the food?\n\n... Well, there's your 5-Star Burger (In-N-Out?), & then there's your VERY 5-Star Burger.  This was that!     :-))\n\nA note regarding SmashBurger Service:  It has always been totally friendly at every location I have visited, but don't come here in a big hurry, as it takes them 10 minutes or so to bring your hot food, which you'll love, no matter what you order.  Your terrific chocolate malt will arrive sooner, to hold you over!     :-)"""""""
4	Extremely bizarre to roll up on this place and see exactly one vehicle in the parking lot, front or back. It's right off I-10, so you'd think more people would roll off for a bite. Whatever... I'm willing to take a few things on faith at my age.\n\nThe host/waiter/etc guy (I think there -had- to be a separate cook in the back, but I'm not sure) was efficient and professional. Everything was quick including ordering, serving, drink refills, and so on. I wouldn't go so far as to say he was friendly, but he wasn't unfriendly either. He just... was. Really, though, isn't that enough? Do we need intrusive or annoyingly perky servers?\n\nThe food was very good. My wife had the Pork Birria and I had flautas. The pork was cooked well and the sauce was delicious. The flautas were very good with nice fresh toppings. They have a good recipe for mexican rice as well. Portions were reasonable, as you can see from some of the photos.\n\nCheck this place out. It's worthwhile to support a local place that's doing good by its customers.
5	I used to live in Ahwatukee and Florencia Pizza Bistro is my absolute favorite pizza that I found there and in all of Phoenix so far!  The sauce is unique and sweet, and I've never been disappointed by the quality of their food overall, especially the Margherita pizza and pesto cheese bread!  Now that I'm living in the north valley, I always try to find a pizza joint that's half as good as Florencia.\n\nThe only downfall to this Ahwatukee gem is that the service is sometimes lacking, as it could be hard at times to get your server's attention, causing  food to take a while to make it to your table.  The problem seems to be that there are usually 3 greeters at the door standing around, but only 2 servers helping tables!\n\nI will say, though, when we became regulars, we would ask to sit in one waitress, Carrie's, section, and she would already have our order in for us when she saw us coming!  If the rest of the servers could give the attention she did, service would be top notch.\n\nOverall, Florencia Pizza Bistro is my absolute favorite pizza place in the valley; I only wish it wasn't so far away now that I've moved!
3	I had the Egg Flower soup and house fried rice.  The soup had water chestnuts, which I don't really like, but it had a nice flavorful peppery broth.  The fried rice was good, it had a few large chunks of beef, but was a little skimpy on the chicken and shrimp.  The prices were reasonable, about the same as any other Chinese food place.  They also have a Korean bbq menu and a sushi menu.  The resturant is a little ratty looking, but clean.  The lady that took my order was very nice.  The menu also states that they are completely MSG-free.
4	Ok, my review is for their lunch only because I used to go there quite a bit for their lunch specials. Its ideal if you want to get good food for a good price on your lunch break. Their Mr. Pinks pasta and salad combo is just the right amount for lunch. The wedge salad is great if you are looking for something on the lighter side. Sitting inside or outside is great and you will probably hear a little Frank Sinatra before heading back to work. The staff is very nice, friendly, and quick!
3	I really want to give this place a good review.For what  they are  a bowling alley they really have a good set up.  IWe brought the family for a 13.99 deal per person , which was supposed to include  unlimited pizza, 2 hours  of bowling and shoes. Great deal. But when we arrived they were swamped , the cashier said they couldn't use the coupln because they were too swamped and didn't have pizza. He talked us into a similar deal which basically about the same price  but we got soda and popcorn.  But as we were bowling we saw tons of Pizza being made which seemed lame , especially since we were hungry  but didn't want bowling alley food.  Strange... \n\nHowever the alley itself is clean and neat and looks recently cleaned up / remodeled. They have day glo balls , bright colors and music videos going .. aesthetics were pleasing. \n\nWe had a good time all in all, just wished  we didn't feel baited and switched ...
5	"""This place has my number. There just isn't a thing I don't love about Pizzeria Bianco. It would totally be in the top 10 of an embarrassingly one-dimensional Stuff Lori Likes list: \Waiting at least two hours, fueled by a jammy red, to eat some pizza at 10:00 at night\"""". Naturally, good company and a bowl of meaty olives are a given. Once, I showed up and there was no wait. I went next door first anyway. Call me crazy, but life goes by too fast. I like the wait. \n\nAfter an hour or two and some vino, the antipasto is a must for starters. Local seasonal veggies wood-roasted and drenched in olive oil, cured meat, olives, and some cheese; it doesn't get much better- except when gorgeous heirloom beets are on the platter. Nothing beats 'em (don't groan, it's impolite). \n\nThe Neapolitan style wood-fired pizzas are gooey goodness, one and all. My personal faves are the Rosa (pungent aged cheese, grilled red onions, and pistachios), the Margherita with prosciutto, and the Wiseguy (smoked mozzarella, grilled onions and sliced fennel sausage). And yes, I named half the pizzas on the menu and they are all my favorites. \n\nHoused in an historic building, the atmosphere is rustic and homey. A little candlelight and an open kitchen make me feel like I'm at a friend's home for dinner - and in some ways I am. My first trip to Bianco was 13 years ago when my now husband took me for my 21st birthday; we've been going ever since. \n\nMaybe that's why the wait never bothers me. With consistently attentive, first-name service and so many familiar faces, it feels less like dinner out and more like an evening among friends."""""""
5	I had the pleasure of dining at BLT Steak last night and must say it was Phenomenal.  Everything from the beautiful decor to the warm personal service and of course the delicious food made this my new favorite steak house in the Scottsdale area. Although I must say that I have not been to J&G yet. ( I wonder how Howard Seftel can miss BLT for his top ten steak houses as I thought it was far better than his top pick.)\n\nTo begin with the complimentary pate starter was a nice touch and those popovers are to die for.  Now, I am quite the carnivore so I LOVE a great steak  and typically get the New York strip but they offered a filet that came with sweetbreads that I couldn't pass up.  It had just the right amount of char on the outside and was cooked at a perfect medium rare. The flavor was incredible and went very well with the hen of the woods mushrooms. (This is the only place I have ever found those on the menu in the Phoenix area)  And the part I liked best about their steaks is that they stand on their own, there is no need to soak them in butter or in fat to give them added flavor. Although they offer a slew of sauces to accompany your steak, they are not needed but some are very tasty. I enjoyed the red wine sauce and the peppercorn but found the bearnaise somewhat disappointing.\n\nI also judge a great steak house by the attention they give to their appetizers and side items. I get bored with the typical wedge salad and boring steamed vegetables.  BLT did not disappoint with their delectable hamachi appetizer and the white asparagus salad.They were both amazing to say the least.  As for the side items we ordered off the specials menu which I was told is where the chef creates his own dishes from local products. The sweat corn with prawns was wonderful and to find speatzle on the menu was a real treat.  I could come here and just get the appetizers and side items but then again why would I want to pass up such a great steak.\n\nI thought I was to full for dessert but my guest ordered the passion fruit souffle crepe. WOW!!!! Flavor just explodes in your mouth. We devoured it and those wonderful little chocolate petifores they give you are way to yummy. \n\nI found the service staff to be friendly, knowledgeable and efficient without being overbearing or pushy. All in all we had a great time and will definitely make this our stop for steak  in the valley. \n\nAs a side note it is pricey but no more so than Mastro's or Ruth Chris  and I found it to be less expensive than Bourbon Steak.
4	The service here was great.  The inside was nicely decorated, clean, and very cool on a very hot day.  They were closing early for July 4th in 45 minutes, but that didn't keep them from being extremely nice and helpful.  They had lots of different deli foods that were already prepared that looked great.  We ordered two italian cold cut sandwiches.  We had the option of chips or our choice of salad.  I got greek salad, and the fiance got pasta salad.  The sandwiches were tasty, but next time we'll try them on different bread.  The type of bread it came on was a bit too crusty for us, but the flavor was great.  Our meal came to about $17 total.\n\nI look forward to going back.
3	Ok so I got a salt bagel and cream cheese. The salt bagel was wayyy too salty ..I know I know its a salt bagel, but seriously it was beyond salty and I couldnt brush some of it off. Which I generally can it was like baked in or something. It was pretty good but the texture was not that of a bagel it was more like a kaiser roll shaped like a bagel. For over 3 bucks for a bagel (retarded) I think it should be like the best bagel that ever happened. \nI'd give it another shot because it is better than Chompies and other places Ive been but I will not have another salt bagel. \n\nI also did not check the ingredients for trans fat or shortening so that is really ruining my life right now. I will update once I find out exactly how homemade these puppies are. and then learn to live life knowing I didnt look first like I always do. but we will see.\n\nMore like 2 and a half stars but im rounding up today :)
4	First off, really cool caring staff. Best spot for beer on mill in my opinion if you enjoy really intense baltic porters or imperial stouts. For the food you get a lot for the money. Nice big open bar in the middle of the place and a cool patio that is pretty huge. I would like to maybe invest in this bar and try to market it better to get more people in here but i know how hard mill is. I always stop at this place when im on mill even if its just to slam a Decadent Ipa!
4	Went to dinner for the first time at Soi 4 last night.  The decor and ambiance is amazing.  Great for a romantic date.  \nThe service left a little to be desired.  It took quite a while for us to be greeted by our server and be served our drinks and it wasn't busy...at all.\nThe food was delicious!!!  I had the duck breast in red curry on baby spinach with pineapple and red pepper.  Such flavor!!  I can't wait to go back again and try something else!!
5	"""Great experience.  I took their \lock low and go\"""" special and they gave me a Crown Victoria for 14.99 per day.  Very comfortable.  \nWaited in line less than a minute and the young man was very nice and friendly.  He offered to sell me extra options but was not pushy when I turned them down.  The car was already ready for me.  It had a few scratches but ran great and they didn't charge me for damage.\nA smiling young woman checked my car back in rapidly.  \nSo....  The price was great and there were no hassles at all.  I am very pleased."""""""
3	I have gone to the Deli twice--once about a year and a half to two years ago, and once within the last month.  I enjoyed it far more back when they were just becoming known as a great sandwich destination.  Now, the place is a trendy destination for all of Queen Creek, and it has suffered for the notoriety.  I felt like I was being squeezed in, and could tell our server was frantically trying to seat customers and tend to his tables.   The food remained high quality, but good food can only make up for a poor dining experience for so long.
4	pizzeria bianco was pretty darn good! i didn't know what to expect even though i read rave reviews of this place on yelp. david l. and i were on a roadtrip and stopped by this place while we were in phoenix. we got to the restaurant at 8:40pm and were told that we'd have to come back in 3 hours at 11:40pm (keep in mind the place closes at 10, i guess they just stop taking names at 10).  we were told to check in every hour which we didn't do because we went off and explored more of the town. got back at 11 and were told that the place was now closed. looking sad, we began to walk out when the very nice and generous hostess or manager? asked if we were from out of town. we said yes and i guess she felt bad for us because she offered us a seat at the bar. we thank her big heart!\n\ni ordered the Margherita- - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Basil and david l. ordered the  Sonny Boy - Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives with mushrooms. we both said we werent hungry, but ended up eating everything excpet two slices (which we only stopped eating to save it for the breakfast the next day).  i'm usually not a big fan of thin crust pizza, but the more of this pizza i ate, the more i really really liked it.  the people next to us ordered 5 pizzas for three people.  we should have done that!!\n\nthe margherita pizza here was the best mozzarella and basil pizza i've ever eaten. i would most defintiely come back here if i'm ever in phoenix again. \n\nonly 4 stars because i wish they had normal crust pizza too.
1	God only knows how a company can hire such incompetent and disorganized employees.   Does Nationwide provide any training in customer service at all????   \n\nI just don't get it.  With so many thousands of bright people looking for work, how does a national company end up with such terrible employees?\n\nI mean, how difficult is it to do an accurate eye exam and send it to the lab to get processed?   (Based on my experience here, it must be about as difficult as flying to Jupiter, as they can't seem to get ANYTHING right.)\n\nI've had five experiences with this Nationwide branch (eye exam, 2 types of glasses), and each one has resulted in major errors resulting in delays in receiving glasses.   The employees don't listen, don't write things down, don't follow up, and worst of all they act like they are doing you a favor by even being there.
4	I have waited 12 freaking years for a Jimmy Johns to show up in Phoenix! Finally! Once I had somebody hand carry it down from Chicago, and the other time I drove 2 hours down to Tucson for it. Ok so I'm a little nuts over JJs. The Italian club is awesome and the Hunter's Club is just as good. The bread is just so good. Subway bread is absolute crap compare to this. Not sure why people are whining about the price. $5.25 for a large sub and $4.25 for a small club. That's pretty dang good for this day and age. Highly recommend the Italian. It is so good! If you'd rather go to subway, you have no taste buds.
2	The food and service here is as good as any chain restaurant. What I really wanted to yelp about is, that I was there last night with my 81 year old mom in a wheel chair. The restaurant is not designed to accommodated handicapped people.  The tables are too close together and we were bumping into chairs as we proceeded to and from our table.  The bathrooms have heavy doors that are not handicap friendly.  Mom was not able to independently open the two doors to enter and exit the restrooms. It is a shame that my mother (who likes the Red Lobster food) will no longer be eating at THIS location!
3	Had lunch here a couple of days ago.  \n\nPlace was dead.  Only one other table had people at it.  Service was quick.  Reuben sandwich I ordered was delivered promptly.  Meat was tasty but not exactly plentiful (I'm used to a New York style Reuben - with loads of meat).  Potato salad that came with the sandwich was very good, a pleasant surprise.  \n\nOutdoor seating was nice, though the birds did get tiresome.  Place seemed clean.  Plenty of seats.  Upstairs deck area would be great in the evening.  Seems like it would be a much more fun place with a group of people for happy hour  or dinner than it was for lunch.  \n\nBottom line - it was okay.  Not bad, not great.  I'd give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again.
5	If you like breakfast and everything it stands for, you've got to come to Matt's.  The reviews on Yelp sent me here, and I'm so glad they did.  The food is delicious, and buttery, and fatty.  But if you know in advance what you're getting in to, there's no room for complaints.  The food isn't healthy to put it mildly, but it's delicious. And it's perfect if you're hungover.  Seriously.  Go have breakfast here, take a nap when you get home and you'll be good to go.  \n\nBe advised that there is quite a wait on the weekends.  I had to wait around 35 minutes the time I went, but after reading all the reviews, I knew what to expect, so I didn't mind it. Good food usually means a considerable wait, so just suck it up and go anyways.  Once you try the food, you'll forget you had to sit outside for 40 minutes.
2	I used to LOVE Freddy's.  We started going when we were in Texas on vacation and then the opened this location and WOW...we had a favorite.\n\nWe have been to this location several times and the location in Gilbert twice.  It used to be that EVERY time we went it was AMAZING!!  Now, it is hit or miss.  Last visit to this location the fries were WAY overcooked...quality control would tell you not to send out burnt fries, but no they sent them right out to us.  I think the little burger has shrunk and it was small before.  \n\nOuch, why is it that when you start to really love a place it goes downhill?  Well, at least In & Out burger stays consistant and since I now live in SoCal I guess we won't be missing Freddy's anymore.
3	Caprese Salad was just so so. The tomatoes were similar to the type that you see on a burger and not enough basil or oil. \n\nLOVE the complimentary pizza crust bites and olive/tomato dip. the crust bites were soft puffs that made me excited for what the pizza will taste like. \n\nPizza Meatball was delicious, great crust consistency and just the right amount of sauce to cheese to meatball ratio. \n\nI know its a small mom and pop restaurant, so I feel a bit bad for saying this, but I thought the service was too slow.
5	This is my favorite deli in Phoenix. Two words: Vermont Treat. (Made with Maple Glazed Ham, Pinenuts, Spinach, Sliced Apples, Duck and Decanter's Famous Cheddar Cheese Spread on Multigrain.)\n\nI like this place because I always know what I want (see above), and anyone I bring with me can always find something that fits their tastes, too. For the indecisive bunch, Duck & Decanter offers a list of signature sandwiches with the ingredients already listed. And for the pickier, er, more decided folks, D&D can make custom sandwiches, too -- you can choose your bread, meat, and toppings.\n\nThe ready-made pastas and other sides here are delicious, too, but I rarely get them, because their sandwiches are already so filling!\n\n**Helpful Hint: You must, must, must either beat the lunch crowd or postpone your visit until after the lunch hour, otherwise you'll be at the end of a very long line.**
1	"""If there was ever a prime candidate for the public ax in these lean times it would be this library.  It really offers nothing more than some air conditioning, a couple of 1990's era Sports Illustrated's, and some half empty book shelves.  My illiterate nephew has a bigger book collection than this place.  The middle of the Sonoran desert has more electrical outlets and workstations than this \library\"""".  \nI'm sorry.  I love libraries and books and all but I just don't see much learning coming out of this place.  There are some great alternatives in the area (Burton Barr and Scottsdale)."""""""
5	"""I really had no idea what I was getting myself into when I went to Duck and Decanter.  I'd seen the sign as I would drive south on the 51 and think \I like duck, and I REALLY like wine. This place would be perfect for me!\""""  As it turns out, I wasn't quite wrong, but it was not at all what I expected.\n\nThe Duck and Decanter is a strange blend of deli, gourmet food and kitchen wares store, as well as wine shop.  It all comes together in a fun and eclectic building set far back from the street and the rest of the shops in the area.  You definitely feel, as you enter the candlelit courtyard beneath an enormous old tree, that the world outside does get a little more muffled than it really should be.  Wandering bemusedly through the tiny shop behind the courtyard, I was really struck by how unique this place felt in Phoenix.  Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here, but the quality of food presented to the customer.\n\nWhen I finally got around to the deli counter, I was about to order their specialty duck sandwich when I saw they had a reuben.  As I find it hard to turn down a reuben anywhere, I asked the woman behind the counter what she advised.  Without hesitation she said, \""""The reuben.\""""  Just as I had hoped and I'm glad I listened.  The sandwich was excellent.  Perfectly proportioned and fresh as possible without going backwards in time.  Making a good sandwich really is an art and the workers here are masterful as their craft.\n\nSitting outside at night with a wonderful sandwich in this strangely out of place shop is an opportunity not to be missed.  But take care to go there when you have some time to really savor the place.  Like the wine, there's much to enjoy here and it'd be a shame to miss any of it."""""""
4	This review is for my latest visit to Mido, which was by far the best!\n\nTonight was my fiance's birthday, and he chose to go to Mido for his sushi fix. Thankfully we managed to go when it wasn't too busy, and we could get a table and not sit at the sushi bar. While the sushi bar is convenient, it's not very private and is cramped.\n\nAnyway, tonight the staff at Mido went above and beyond and I couldn't have chose a better place to experience our night. First of all, knowing every other time we have gone it's been busy and we have to sit at the sushi bar, I called ahead to make sure we could have a table--sure, no problem. Next, however, they did something I thought would have been impossible to explain over the phone-- I requested pre ordered adult beverages be delivered to our table upon arrival, to surprise my fiance for his bday celebration (he's not one to go out of his way to order an adult beverage while we out, so i took the liberty of doing it for him [insert evil laugh here] ) and they did just that...right on queue :)\n\nOrdering and receiving was a breeze as per usual, and everything was fresh and delicious. When it was about time to bring the check, our server attempted to ask if we wanted dessert to celebrate, but fiance was on the phone....next thing we know (he had hung up by this time) disco lights are flashing, Asian techno music sounding similar to happy birthday was playing on a speaker above us, and out came our server with some mango ice cream w/ a candle in it. To top it off, the entire restaurant was clapping and she shot a confetti popper in the air too! \n\nThis was by far the best night we've had in such a long time, and we owe it all to Mido! THANKS AGAIN!
5	I found Crossfit infernal about 8 mo.  I was looking to get stronger to improve my marathon time.  What I found was home!  I have been involved in the fitness industry for over 15 years and have been doing body work for 12.  I love the instruction and review.  Not many places care as much as Crossfit infernal or form.  Good form ='s less injury!  The coaching staff is amazing and the members are gold!!!  So what I have after 8 months is faster running times from the mile up to the marathon and everything in-between, I'm  in the best shape of my life, and i have great new friends!\n\nI am forever grateful for Crossfit!!
5	My friend and I stopped in here just to grab a drink after work.  It is so dramatic indoors, I love it.  It is one of those sort of hidden places where you can't really tell where the entrance is (but, in accordance with stuffwhitepeoplelike.com, I am totally into places that seem sort of hidden or secretive).  There is a huge wall mural of the world made entirely out of pennies, fabulous!  They have a huge wine selection, obviously, with some great flights with really fun names.  Because, yes, I may or may not be that person that orders things based on how witty I think the name is.  We were also both a little hungry so we asked the bartender to recommend something to go with the different flights we had ordered.  He brought out probably the biggest cheese plate I have ever seen.  This steroid plate had everything!  A variety of breads, fruits, nuts, and of course cheeses.  There was a blueberry stilton that seriously changed my life.  If this cheese were a person, they would build monuments and name cities after it.  It may be a wine bar, but I will definitely go back just for that stilton.
4	This location is by far the BEST Home Depot in the Phoenix area. It's located a ways out of the central city, and is fairly newly built, therefore it's never busy. \n\nFinding a peaceful hardware store is serenity in today's world. Especially if you are a woman and often find yourself chasing down employees to help you with the complexity that is home improvement. \n\nTheir nursery is my favorite department at this location. The staff  is so sweet and helpful, I always get asked for help at least three times every time I go. \n\nI love Home Depot, it gives any home and any budget a chance to flourish and differ from everyone else's home. The prices are always affordable, the staff knowledgable and there is always plenty of everything in stock. \n\nGo Camelback Home Depot!! :)
4	The short:\nDelicious, tasty flavors with fresh toppings at a decent price. Service was friendly and helpful, and the shop was very clean and cheery. \n\nThe long:\nLiving off 20th St. and Camelback, I already had two frozen yogurt places with walking distance. I'm glad to add The Chill as a third--best of all, it's the closest to my house, and I think it's most conducive to becoming a neighborhood joint (if fro-yo places could become neighborhood joints). \n\nImmediate parking can get sketchy, especially earlier in the night when you have to compete with the patrons dining at the restaurant next door, but there's a load of parking in the big lot facing Bethany Home and around the back on the south side of the shopping center.\n\nWe stopped in to visit on a pretty chilly night, and I wasn't surprised to see the place empty aside from an employee who was busily making sure the machines were clean. As soon as we walked in, she greeted us warmly and offered sampling cups to us. I was impressed with the array of flavors--just as many as the chains with flavors just as unique and enticing.\n\nI'll admit, I'm a sweet yogurt fan, so I neglected to try the tart, but the four flavors I tried were awesome: red velvet cake, cake batter, pistachio, and peanut butter. The cake flavors were tasty, the pistachio was fine, but for me, the peanut butter was the clear-cut winner. My boyfriend had the chocolate, mint, and coffee, and all of those were good, too. The coffee is for die-hard coffee fans--it tasted like a decent cup of good, black coffee. The consistency was smooth and firm--no icy crystals or drippiness, which are both pet peeves in any frozen dessert where those factors don't belong. The fruit looked fresh, but unless there are blueberries, I tend to go for walnuts, almonds, and granola, and those were all fresh and tasty. My boyfriend obeyes his usual sweet tooth and went for the standards: Snickers, Milky Way, mini Reeses Pieces, and chocolate chips. There were a couple dozen additional options and a shelf of the regular sauces--butterscotch, chocolate, etc.--and everything was tidy and looked good. I'm also glad that their toppings bar was an island instead of a one-sided counter so you couldn't get stuck in a line of slow toppers mulling things over. As far as price, it was comparable to the other places, and we received a flyer with coupons at our house. I've also seen other coupons for them online (Amazon.com just e-mailed a half-off deal this morning). \n\nFor a new store, I'm impressed that everything was so together. I guess the true test will be after the place has been open for a few months, especially through the cold season, to see if they keep up with the fresh toppings and well-made, yummy fro-yo flavors. We tend to make a frozen yogur run every 2 or 3 weeks, and we're looking forward to coming back here. I want to try their Cookies and Cream!
4	Based on a strong recommendation, Pane Bianco was one of the few spots I hit on a quick Arizona trip.    Great little spot for simple sandwiches and a nice, fulfilling lunch which won't leave you feeling like junk afterwards.  The fresh mozzarella is spot on what it should have tasted like, fresh, clean, and delicious.   \n\nNot even a huge fan of basil or tomatoes, but you could tell they were very fresh and the entire thing just worked.  The huge wood-fired oven was pushing out hot bread like no one's business, and the entire experience was really great.  What a lunch place should be.    Plus, a nice little caramel in the bag to finish your meal.   Would have liked to see some small pizza options on the menu, but then again, if you want pizza, there's always his other little restaurant..
4	Always wanted to try a Fatburger ever since Ice Cube told me that he ate one at two in the morning.\n\nWell I had my eyes did at Lasik Plus about 2 years ago which is right next to the fatburger, so after my initial consult we moseyed on over to try it out.  The burgers were aight, Thanks alot O'shea! Foo, I'm just trickin'! No, but seriously they were good, and where else can you add an egg to your burger?.  The relish was a bit strong, so I recommend that you get it on the side, or not at all.  Hey, it was clean, and the staff wasn't all loungin' around when I went. Maybe the boss was there!
4	I have 48 check in's at Chase....It's way past time for a review.\n\nI find it difficult to compare all major league ballparks, so I tend to separate them in to 3 major categories (historic, mutli-use, and new). Chase Field would definitely fall into the new category along with others like Petco, Miller Park, Progressive, etc., so I'm going to judge the field through that lens.\n\n\nBuilding (Atmosphere): 3.5/5 stars - The ballpark is typically empty, which is very disappointing since I'd like to see the Dbacks be as successful as they can (aside from the 7 games a year they play the Cubs). The crowd will occasionally get behind the team, but on a typical weeknight, it can be pretty quiet in there. I've been to playoff games, which are much more lively than a regular season game. But overall, it's about as quiet as a library. I have an appreciation for games like this, but it's not a regular MLB ballpark setting.\n\nBuilding (Physical): 4.5/5 stars - The building is a very impressive structure and the sightlines are great. I've sat all over the ballpark, and never felt ripped off for a ticket price. Air conditioning, retractable roof, giant Jumbotron, activities to keep the kids busy, and plenty of other entertainment; the Dbacks have thought of it all. One thing to keep in mind though, the ballpark is a MUCH BETTER experience when the roof is open. Baseball was meant to be played outside.\n\nFOOD: 4/5 stars - There's plenty of food options (pizza, hot dogs, ice cream, burgers, even Chinese), but I'll just recommend the best places. Make sure to visit the tamale stand down the 3rd base line - it's in a cart on the inside of the concourse - and the specialty hot dog location - outside of the concourse, 3rd base line - for something quick. If you want a sit down pre-game meal, there's a buffet underneath the stands behind homeplate (approx. $27.00 - I think) that is VERY good.\n\nValue: 5/5 stars - Keep in mind, this is a value ONLY for a MLB ballpark. It is still an expensive afternoon for a family. However, ticket prices and food prices are relatively reasonable. I recommend bleacher seats for the best value on tickets. The Dbacks are offering a $19.00 deal for a ticket, 2 sodas, and a hot dog. Food-wise once you're in the ballpark, the best value options are Panda Express in RF and the value deals at the concession stands.\n\nService/Organizational: 5/5 stars - A few years ago (pre-Derrick Hall) I would have given the Dbacks a 1/5 rating on this. Now, they've become a first-class organization. Every employee I come in contact with has been pleasant and helpful. Obviously, you see ushers and vendors more than anyone, but the front office is also great. The Dbacks are gaining national attention for being the best organization in sports, and they are very deserving of this honor.\n\n\nOverall, if you get an opportunity to attend a game at Chase Field, DO IT! It's a great ballpark and an enjoyable and memorable event!
4	One of the oldest Spring Training complexes in Arizona is also one of the best.  Situated just outside of Old Town Scottsdale, Scottsdale Stadium offers a great place to watch a game as well as a location that begs you to go out after it is over.\n\nGetting to Scottsdale Stadium can be a bit of a pain.  It is a few miles from the freeway and almost requires that you deal with Scottsdale traffic.  If you take Earll to Civic Center and then merge on to Drinkwater, you should be able to find either street parking or library parking for free.  The dirt lots on the east side of the stadium should be avoided.  Also, the Trolley goes by the stadium so you can park anywhere along the line and catch it.\n\nOnce you try to walk into Scottsdale Stadium, you will notice the food bank collection going on at each gate.  This is not voluntary.  You will be required to drop off everything eatable or drinkable (except closed water bottles) before you can enter.  This, of course, should prepare you to empty your wallet once you are inside.\n\nThe concrete concourse obstructs the field which is a big hindrance but the area down the foul lines and the entire outfield berm has a clear view from the concourse.  That is where most of the good food is located anyways so you can stay out from behind the concrete monster.  There are plenty of food vendors and usually a nice broad selection of beers & cocktails.  \n\nSeating in Scottsdale is some of the best.  The berm seating has a huge slope and features large shade trees.  This makes for the best grass seating in the Cactus League.  The regular seats are a bit on the smaller side but almost all of them are close to the field and have good views.\n\nThe practice field is beyond the right field wall.  Usually, this means the visiting team takes BP on the main field making this a great place for autographs.  If you were to want a Giant to autograph something, they all come down the first base line and most will stop and sign.  Don't expect to have access to the practice field beyond standing behind a chain link fence.\n\nThis stadium has hosted so many teams over the years, it is too bad the terrible Giants play there now.  Ignoring that fact, Scottsdale Stadium is a great place to catch a game, especially if you are in the East Valley.
4	My wife and I ate lunch here yesterday, 03/17, before our trip over to PHX Art Museum. We shared the Nachos to start, very good. I had the chicken salad and she tried the Chicken with a side of baked beans. My chicken was spiced perfect and I loved mix. We wife not a big fan of leaving her comfort zone, enjoyed trying something new. I tried a bite and too enjoyed the sandwhich and beans. The atmosphere was excellent and the only draw back was the wait staff seemed a little discombobulated. All and all a great time and great meal.
2	"""My friend and I hadn't had sushi in a while and we were on Mill, so why not go to Ra?  I think the question should have been, \Why go to Ra?\""""  \n\nFirst of all, I walk in and there's three 15 year old girls standing at the host stand busily texting on their phones.  They all look up, but only one of them stops texting.  She looked visibly upset that I had interrupted her conversation and doesn't even really greet me.  I then say \""""Table for two\"""" and she says \""""Why don't you guys go sit over there, I'll get a waiter.\""""  Not pointing in any general direction mind you.  Come to find out, it's the table right by the door (who wants to sit right by the door.... ever????) \n\nSo we sit there and can't see anything cuz it's super dark and the lights are mind numbing red.  I struggle to read the menu while I realize how thirsty I'm getting.  So we sit there, and sit there.  15 mintues went by before Random Server Girl walked up and took our drink order.  I made sure to order our edimame before she walked away.  Never introduced herself the whole time.  She didnt' have time to bring our drinks until the appitizer came (10 mins later) but she had plenty of time to go and chit chat with the 15 year olds at the host stand.  Grr!\n\nOur drinks come and app come, she takes our food order.  I am a notorious soda chugger.  At least the first one, but we never see her again until our food comes.  She gets me a refill after I've drunk all the spit in my mouth from the salty edimame. Grr  \n\nFinally food and driks are there and I'm happy but careful not to finish my soda.  We never see her again and then she brings the check.  I actually was gonna order some sake for after my dinner but since she decided that we were done, I guess we were done.  Grr.  \n\nI paid andstill tipped her more than she deserved.  Moral of the story:  Service at Ra is terrible and the servers are magical, they just disappear right before your eyes!"""""""
5	I wrote a review of this vegetarian and glute-free friendly restaurant a few months ago.  In the intervening months, I have sampled more (i.e., most) of the menu and it has become, hands down, my favorite restaurant in all of Arizona, knocking out some serious competition.\n\nI eat at Gallo Blanco 2-3 times a week.  If I lived in the neighborhood, it would be even more often.  The food is fresh, hot and tasty.  The staff is wonderful. Whether I am trading jokes with Melissa or talking business with Susan, everyone is always happy and goes out of their way to make the experience fun and comfortable.\n\nI have made it my personal mission to get the word out about this place (and to get one in the Ahwatukee area).  Every one of the over twenty people I have taken to Gallo Blanco has been enthusiastic about returning.  What higher praise is there than that.
2	I came in and it felt like i had five waitresses.  The tip's going to suck if they have to split it five ways.  I came in with a party of 4 for breakfast.  The sausage links were burnt.  My steak had black burn marks where it was charred, but was still too rare at other spots.  Even the english muffins were too black.  The only thing that turned out right was the kids meal, scrambled eggs and toast.  \n\nI won't be back.
4	I definitely enjoyed Lo-Lo's, but I don't know if part of it wasn't just because of the novelty, and how much I wanted to like it. We went on a Sunday after church, and it was PACKED. We had a very long wait (which told us it must be pretty good!), but the kind people of Lo-Lo's were kind enough to provide us with a shade structure and mister-fan to combat some of that infamous Phoenix heat. They even had a water cooler with cold water for us to enjoy while we waited, so that we would not swoon from heat exhaustion.\n\nThe food was tasty, that's for sure. I ordered one piece of chicken breast and one waffle. Both items were DELICIOUS! Thank goodness Lo-Lo's knows how to make their namesake dishes, and make them well! I felt like my meal cost a little more than I would have hoped, for just a piece of chicken and a waffle. It's worth going there, though, for the experience.
1	I've stopped in 2 or 3 times now and I have yet to interact with any of the sales people. Every time I've been in there, I've been completely ignored. The last time I went in, I waited by the register to ask a question about signing up for a class, and the women were too busy gossiping with another customer/friend to even acknowledge me.\n\nThey have a decent selection and their prices are average. But their customer service is non-existent. I won't be returning.
5	This location rocks! We've been in AZ and TX and let me tell you, they have the BEST ribs on the planet! You would never guess it, but since being in the land of the bbq nation = TX, this place wins hands down.\n\nThey also have the best spinach and arti dip around. Salads are great, glazed carrots are to die for, and honey-drenched croissants that will make you drool. Ok, now I'm hungry...Service is always top notch and friendly. Would recommend to anyone for any type of food - they have it all!
4	"""I'm giving this place a generous 4 stars because the food is actually very tasty. I've been here twice now, and I'm never disappointed. Indian food has to be on the top of my list for favorite cuisines, and I am sad to say there aren't many or any great Indian restaurants that I have found in Phoenix. Flavors of India, however, seems to satisfy my palate. I enjoy the chicken tikka masala every time. I have also tried the curry chicken, which is also very tasty. The chicken is very fresh and tender, both the light and dark meat. The naan is a bit flat and not soft or chewy enough for my taste, but it does its job. I really enjoy their basmati rice. It's not the most elaborate or flavorful I've ever had, but for some reason, I'm drawn to it, and even crave it. There's no saffron or cloves; it's a bit on the simple side, and just a tad bit sticky. The samosas are decent, although I have had better. If you are in the mood for some Indian food, and this place is close by, I suggest you head on over. Prices are reasonable. Two can eat for 30 bucks, including multiple appetizers. The food is prepared quickly. It's not the prettiest of restaurants but it has it's interesting Indian decor with a twist of Mexican thrown in. At least that's my impression. I don't like that they are closed on Sundays, since that's when I typically like to eat Indian food. The quantity is definitely sufficient, and you will have left overs, unless you like to \pig out.\""""   Try it, you'll probably like it!"""""""
3	This is a safe place to eat a burger, and not wanting to be the adventurous type that night I opted to go to Red Robin. Walking in was kind of a pain as we waited for a few minutes to be seated, it was one of those where's the waitress or anybody?? front of the house. Finally a man walked out from the abyss in the back and seated us.\n\nFYI in case you have never been: bottomless root beer floats for $3 and bottomless fries with any burger. Sometimes the steak fries are too soggy as you get nearer the bottom of the basket and some of them may be way too over salted, just a warning. The thousand island dressing that came with my patty melt was great, almost felt like asking what brand it was. If you are a vegetarian, they offer either Morningstar or Boca substitutions. \n\nIt didn't appear that there were very many people in the restaurant but the service was okay despite this.
4	"""The service in this place is outstanding.  Any question is always answered with a \yes we can do that\"""".  The atmosphere is relaxing, the view is nice and they serve martinis in a coupe glass.  The potato gratin and oysters are good.  The steaks could be a little more consistent.  Ordering medium rare shouldn't be such a crapshoot.  Front of the house is a bit bogus as they will spread you out even if you request a view.  Once you get to your crappy view table just ask to be moved."""""""
5	Came by for a group dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the view from the patio facing the fountain!\n\nHouse Salad \n- Fresh greens w/ a light dressing that wasn't too overwhelming!\n\n28 Day Aged Beef Tenderloin - ~$22\n- Tenderloin was moist and tender\n- Mashed potatoes were perfectly cooked\n- Vegetable was bitter...needed some sugar\n\nCreme Brulee\n- came out slightly cold\n- ...not too sweet! :)\n- very tasty!\n\nDespite having a relatively large group, service was decent and the wait staff kept on coming by to refill water.\n\n....I do know that my colleague was not so lucky and had a relatively undercooked piece of tenderloin!
2	I have come here for football games on Sunday and my problem is that they don't have enough or for that matter any football specials on food. They have what they always have on Sunday which is all you can eat lousy pizza for $8. They need to have a football menu and another beef is that 3/4 of their appetizers are more expensive than some entrees and sandwiches. The pizza bread junk that we ordered was a dollar more than a turkey sandwich with fries. Oh and that forementioned pizza bread was horrible, literally the chef just cut up one of their junky thin crust pizza's and served it on a plate with marinara sauce. Nothing like the menu description - would have returned it, but shift change left the place devoid of servers right after 1pm football games ended. THey do have a good selection of beers, but the only sunday special is flat glasses of lite beer for $2 which was returned. Also, on this day a tree company (on sunday) was cutting trees on property producing a loud buzzing sound for about an hour. Who cuts trees on Sunday? Service is great though, but be creative with your menu because there are like 100 places that show football around here and most have specials that make the joint worth going to at least.
5	Went on a weeknight and it wasn't too crowded, but perfect for getting drinks after school/work.  Had a glass of wine called kung fu girl, nachos, and mac n' cheese. The mac n cheese was sinfully delicious.. seriously, it was so creamy and rich, I felt my waistline expanding, but it was too good that I couldn't stop myself.  It was a little too creamy and salty for my liking, but that's because I like to eat a little on the light side.  The nachos were to die for- the pulled pork was a surprisingly good combination with the regular nacho toppings- definitely didn't see that one coming!  I'm waiting for a good occasion to try this place again; nice little romantic date spot I'd say ;)
1	"""Cheap and fast oil change and I love their waiting room, big leather couches, roomy, away from the door, big tv...this is a really cool place to get an oil change and he alerted me to a bigger problem which did turn out to be pretty urgent (busted CV boot) but I took it to my mechanic who (and I already knew) charged me half of what they quoted me but my mechanic also asked me whether or not my car was making any noise beforehand and I said \NO, everything was great until I went in to Big O for the oil change and he told me the CV boot was busted...why???\"""" and the mechanic said well look at it, and the rubber cv boot had a nice clean beautiful slice across it......and my mechanic's opinion was that Big O cut my CV boot theirself....after reading the other reviews of this place I honestly will never ever go here again, and Im sorry for all the trouble he caused me...I was without my car 9 days, had to bus, bum rides, missed some christmas events all so slimballs could make a fast buck. If a cv boot busted/broke...it would obviously look ripped since its all rubber...it would never ever look like a clean knife slice..."""""""
4	Thanks to Yelp Eats my husband and I finally got down to Nobuo.\n\nWord to the wise, if you want to eat here, arrive when they open or make a reservation.  It is popular.\n\nWe kept our dinner fairly simple, kimchee, yellowtail w/grapefruit, pork buns and the soy/miso marinated yellowtail.\n\nAll were absolutely divine!\n\nI could have eaten so many of the yellowtail grapefruit combos.  They come on little spoons and you're supposed to eat it in one bite.  The acidity from the grapefruit works perfectly with the yellowtail.  It just melts in your mouth.\n\nAnd the kimchee.  So so good.  Sometimes I'm not a big fan, but this was delish.\n\nThe pork buns have been mentioned tons in reviews.  They are every bit as wonderful as described.  Unlike your typical bbq pork bun, the bun is folded around the pork belly which means everything is cooked to perfection and is just the right temperature (since steamed pork buns can burn your mouth because they're so hot in the middle, but oh so good).\n\nWe had the apple fritters to finish and they were just divine.  It was the perfect meal and we left feeling perfectly fed and content.  We weren't overstuffed or uncomfortable, just ridiculously happy.  We can't wait for the weather to cool down again, get on our bikes, and ride downtown to heritage square.
5	I've been going to Luke's in Chicagoland since the 70's. I happened to be in the area and thought I hit it for lunch. The place was mobbed, I got the last parking spot (sweet). I ordered an Italian Sausage sandwich with red sauce, small fries and a regular drink for $10.23. Finally, a place claiming to be a Chicago place that actually knew what red sauce was. \n\nThe Italian Sausage was grilled and delicious and about 12 inches long on a perfectly fitted bun (now I know why lunch was over $10). The fries were crunchy and good as well. I recommend the Polish Sausage sandwich and beef sandwich as well, had those a couple weeks ago.
4	"""I went here for lunch yesterday with a few friends/coworkers and thought it was the cutest place I have been in a long time.  I have to admit, the area seemed a little weird to me, but maybe its just because I'm not familiar with the area.  We entered, and were immediately greeted and told that there is a hearing for the liquor license on the 28th...so that should definitely be a plus for this place.  There was a gentleman playing guitar which was very nice, but just a wee bit too loud for ambiance - we had a hard time hearing each other.\n\nTwo of my meal mates shared the hummus to start, I tried it and it was awesome as were the dolmas served on the side.  It all looked fresh and was presented very nicely.  I ordered the Champs de Elysee' sandwich which was TO DIE FOR...if you like brie, I highly recommend it.  The soup of the day was crab bisque.  When I asked our server if it was a red or white bisque he told me \neither\"""" and then let me know that most of their items were nontraditional.  He wasn't lying.  I don't think there was a piece of crab in my bisque.  It was more of a broth, with large potato chunks and pieces of grape/vine leaves.  It wasn't bad, I just don't think I would get it again.\n\nEveryone else enjoyed their food.  The two downers that prevent me from being able to give it 5 stars are the lack of parking - some stupid macho man twit in his white Dodge Ram was blocking most of the driveway then almost runs me over trying to get a spot in the parking lot when he could have just as easily parked where he was sitting on the side of the road (which is where I ended up parking btw) and the soup.  It just wasn't a crab bisque"""""""
5	"""First off go to tenderbelly.com and order your \Bacon, It's Good For Ya\"""" t-shirt. Then head over to CPH and order a properly made moscow mule and some bacon fat popcorn to get started. \n\nI really have nothing but good things to say about this place. I have had the pork belly, the filet, the burger, gourmet grilled cheese, hummus, and a few more things. The temperature, portion size, flavors, and prices on everything have been spot on. \n\nFor those of you who are in to the current trend of supporting local and smaller business ventures, I found out that this place was started by a couple of local service industry guys along with Chef Bernie. Bernie uses tenderbelly pork and *Smart Chicken chicken. I googled both to find out why he chose these companies. The deserts are made by a local women and sold at the restaurant. They do change occasionaly.\n\nChef Bernie is also the creator of the famed \""""Stetson Salad\"""" going by the name \""""Original Chopped\"""" at CPH. Anyone who is from Scottsdale is probably aware of the popularity of this single item. So if you have friends visiting from out of town, or you are visiting yourself, this is a local fave.\n\nI recently had a bartender friend tell me \""""I'm so tired of hearing the term mixologist\"""". It may be overused, but this bar can probably get away with it. I am mainly a wine drinker, but they have a long list of really unique cocktails on the menu and I notice a few new ones added every few visits. Richie is one of those guys where you can say \""""i had something that was like blah, blah, blah, but have no idea what was in it\"""" and he will probably figure out what you are talking about even when you aren't quite sure. \n\nThe last good thing I will say is liking CPH on FB is worth it. I notice many places that never seem to update anything. CPH is very good about keeping you in the loop about the daily special, deal, and new dishes."""""""
5	"""Los Dos Molinos, you are like my exgirlfriend.\n\nRidiculously HOT. Soooo tasty that I can't resist going back for more. Kicking me in the balls at every opportunity. A major attitude problem from knowing that you're all that and that if I dump you you'll just replace me with another customer without another thought. You even treat my friends like crap. You made one wait for 20 minutes today because he was honest enough to say there were 2 in his party but I was late. Totally pissed him off with your \we won't seat you until you're all here\"""" policy. So arrogant. No wonder I've sworn to all my friends that I will never come back to you again. \n\nDid I mention that you're ridiculously hot? I love you."""""""
2	I went on Third Fridays (June) and felt bad for the barista as there was a bit of a line and it seemed like she was the only employee around. However, she was pretty good about keeping an eye on the line and taking the orders of people in the order they arrived (despite all of us lounging around the counter haphazardly).\n\nIt was hot so I ordered a 20oz iced Americano. It was quite possibly the worst Americano I've ever had- so much so that I threw it out halfway through drinking it. I watched the barista prepare it and while I would prefer my portafilters be cleaned between orders, the part I'm outraged over is when I only received 2 shots (that's TWO OUNCES) of espresso in my TWENTY OUNCE drink.\n\nCome on now. The only flavors Americanos have come directly from the espresso since water is essentially flavorless. Isn't it standard procedure to, at minimum, have 4 shots of espresso in a 20oz Americano? I stopped paying attention to the way the rest of my drink was made, but it seemed to warm up fairly quick. Maybe the ice to water ratio was off too?\n\nHere is how to make a 20oz iced Americano: fill the glass all the way with ice, pull 4 shots of espresso (please clean the portafilter beforehand), pour espresso shots slowly into glass full of ice, top off with COLD water if necessary (if they don't need room for cream/milk).\n\nI'll probably be back to give their food options a chance. The Nutella crepe looks delish.
4	I came here in hope of finding some great vintage pieces for my bedroom for a good price. FOUND IT.  Unlike all of the other OVERPRICED consignment stores in scottsdale this place was PERFECT. REASONABLE to CHEAP prices. GREAT vintage finds...I can't rave enough about this place. I bought TWO matching 70's retro nightstands ...got BOTH for 50 bucks.. a little paint and some new knobs and my dream room is complete. Amazing furniture, cool clothes, SPECTACULAR trinkets to complete any house with that 'lived in' vintage feel. COME HERE FIRST BEFORE OVERPAYING AT ANY OTHER CONSIGNMENT STORE!
5	took my mom, grandma, and the mrs. here for the kickoff to my birthday weekend. my family doesn't experience much downtown (they're *gag* scottsdale) so i chose cibo as the perfect introduction to the wonderful cuisine and atmosphere cen pho offers. \n\nwent at 6pm on a friday night and the wait wasn't bad - maybe 15-20 minutes. it wasn't too crowded in there so we managed to huddle around the bar and have a drink and chat for a bit before we were seating. i had almost forgotten how absolutely charming this place was - you feel very at home inside, and it makes for a comfortable meal and dining experience.\n\nalthough the service wasn't as good as i expected it to be - our waiter disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on us very often - it wasn't bad enough to the point of knocking the place down a star. \n\nfirst up came the bread and olive oil, and when we asked for butter, we were denied because they didn't have any. what restaurant doesn't have butter? we ordered two salads to share - the house salad and the pear salad. both were superb. the large chunks of parmigiano  on the house salad were tasty as was the balsamic dressing - not too much and not too little - just right. we went with two pizzas, a red and a white. the capriciossa and the other one i forgot the name (it had fontina cheese and pepperoni, and it's not on the online menu). the white pizza was definitely  my favorite, as i am not a fan of pizza with a lot of toppings. i just can't get over how delicious these pizzas are - the crispy wood-fired crust and the cheesiest of cheeses - cooked to perfect. we couldn't leave without desert, and settled on the nutella and fresca. both were to die for; i prefered the fruitiness of the fresca to the somewhat overly sweet nutella. \n\noh how i heart your pizza, cibo. no need to try pizzeria bi-crappo, you treat me and my taste buds perfectly.
4	From what I hear, this is the oldest continually operating restaurant in Phoenix, and is also the last remnant of Chinatown.  The place is old and run down, parking is a pain, and it's tough to get to sometimes because of what seems like never-ending construction and road work.\n\nBut...the food is outstanding!  I am eating my way through the menu, and everything I have tried is fantastic and hot and fresh.  It's Cantonese, so a bit different than some folks may be used to unless they came here from a city with a big Chinese population.  The service is great too!
4	"""My friend and I visited Cooperstown in March before a Suns game and had a blast! We sat at the bar and were surrounded by big screens with sports stuff, a cool bartender who hooked us up with happy hour Stella Artois and a platter of food, and lots of pretty waitresses wearing Alice Cooper-like makeup and covered in tattoos. It was busy but pleasant. There are tons of music-related items of Alice from vinyls to guitars and photos, as well as sports stuff everywhere.\n\nThe sampler platter included delicious pulled pork mini burgers, two potato skins (named \Pat Tillman potato skins\"""" on the menu), buffalo chicken wings, and chicken tenders. The pulled pork was DELICIOUS and we were licking up the sauce. The tenders were great in ranch sauce. It also had a plate of crispy fries, my favorite. The chicken wings were good but not great, it wasn't fall off the bone delicious but it was not overcooked and I enjoyed it. \n\nWe got out of there with two beers apiece and the sampler platter for $36 tip included. \n\nGreat atmosphere, wonderful vibe. I will be returning here."""""""
4	Dolce Vita Coffee has grande caffe.  Also molto piacevole people who make your coffee with care.  Orgoglio=pride according to freetranslation.com.  You'll find it here.\n\nEven though this is a newer establishment I felt like the gentlemen preparing my espresso drink was old school.  Care was obviously taken with the preparation of the drink.  Ah, coffee as art form...fantastico!\n\nThe atmosphere is neat and casual with outside seating.  They also have a small selection of gelato.  \n\nI'm not sure if the owners are from Italy but I would not be surprised to find out they are.\n\nFree wifi doesn't hurt either.\n\nDolce Vita is located in the same shopping center as Sprouts, in the corner.
3	FOOD: I don't know why Cornish Pasty is listed as British food. Most of the choices of pasties are not British at all. For those of you who don't know what a pasty is, it's basically a baked pastry case filled with your choice of ingredients. Very much resembles a pie. Pasties are the only item on the menu but there are a wide variety of flavors. I had the Oggy, and it was enjoyable mostly because it was different than most foods I eat for lunch or have even tried before (and it seemed the most British). The ingredients are not amazing, but overall it was a good lunch. Dip your pasty in ketchup so it isn't so dry. \n\nPRICE: The pasties are kinda expensive for what you get. A pasty will run for about $8-9 without any sides. The pasties aren't very large, but will be enough for a lunch. \n\nSERVICE: We were served by a nice girl, and the lunch went very smoothly. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Very thin dining area. Only one table can sit 3 people, the rest are bar stools and 2 person tables. Didn't really seem British with the metal rock playing in the kitchen either. Maybe if it was the Sex Pistols...\n\nSKINNY: Cornish Pasty is great lunch spot at best, but doesn't offer anything that will blow your socks off. Interesting food with decent taste. I'll probably be going back.
4	I recently went to Heidi's for the first time and it was great. They had a white board with the day's special written on it: a chicken salad sandwich that came with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato and onion, your choice of a side, potato salad, coleslaw, or chips, and a fountain drink for $5.95! What a great deal! We asked the girl working if she liked the chicken salad and she replied that she did not like it because they use honey in it. I appreciated her honesty and got it anyway, I like honey! The chicken salad was great! Certainly not what I expect chicken salad to taste like, but delicious. I chose to have it on pumpernickle bread, which they bake fresh. I decided on potato salad for my side. It is made with red potatos and tasted good but the portion was very small! Now that I know how tiny the side portions are, I will always get a bag of chips instead.\nI am excited to go back and try some real deli classics and see what else they offer for cheap daily specials!
5	All around great little place that you all must check out! \n\nI stopped in for the first time yesterday, just kinda in the mood to look around, no intention of buying anything. Actually I really didn't want to buy anything, but I couldn't help it, I had to. \n\nOakville Grocery is perfect for finding that one specific thing you need that you cannot find in the regular grocery store. I was searching for this special hot sauce that I used to have at the old bar I worked at called Da Bomb for days, its fantastic, pretty much lights your head on fire, anyyywaysss, I couldn't find it ANYWHERE. Guess who had it... Oakville for sure! \n\nThey also have an amazing selection of wines, cheeses from all over the world, and fantastically educated people to help you find exactly what you are looking for whether it be blue cheese stuffed olives, St. Andre French cheese, horseradish-wasabi mustard, anything. \n\nCheck it out! It also doesn't suck that it's right next to H&M ;-)
4	(I'm a tourist from LA)\n\nThis place wasn't that bad looking.  Reminded me on the SHAG club/lounge in LA.  Chandler, low light, candles, small cute place, side bar, small dance floor, side table service.  \n\nOverall, pretty fun bar to walk by.  No fee and of course 21+.  No seating unless you have service table.  Friday night DJ was okay.\n\nBathroom: (Women) 2 stalls, small and horrible.  One was plugged up that night.  There is a mirror inside.\n\nParking: Street (difficult to find), Private Parking Lot $5-$8.\n\nSmoking: Outdoor\n\nSurrounding: Bars, Restaurants, Late Night Eats, etc.  Brick sidewalks, so watch you ladies with your heels.  Its going to hurt later =(
5	Since moving more centralized, this has become my wife and I's favorite pizza for dine in and to go, as well as the Glendale Ave location.  They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no chese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference.  I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian on thin crust.  \n\nWe recently took my in-laws here and it was a hit with all! My nephew loved the cheese steak calzone. My mother and father in-law got a thick crust pizza, which was huge and hearty!  They may still be eating it for leftovers. Bro in-law and niece split a plain cheese pizza and said it was aewsome.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home.
5	I can't believe I'm the first to review my college stomping grounds and former place of college employment.\nCCP, you hold a soft place in my heart. You gave me my professional start in my career in the arts, and you have North America's most kick @ss collection of photos. \nSERIOUSLY every one. If you go to U of A, you might think this is just a funky place for a class- but truly- there is something special here. Contemporary and Creative Photography would not exist with out help from this place. I try to visit whenever I'm in Tucson, but now they also have part of their collection at PAM ( Phoenix Art Museum) just a mile from where I work in Phoenix.
3	Sat on the patio with my wife for a date without the kids. A trendy bar like atmosphere with that 'north Scottsdale' feel. \n\nWe split a Half order of ceasar salad and the Tuscan tomato soup for an appetizer. I really enjoyed the soup, very flavorfull and not your average tomato soup. Had a much fresher not so creamy taste. Salad was average. Then we split the number one burger and a side 'half and half' order of the sweet potato fries and onion rings. Burger was thick juicy and had a good taste. Sides were also good.  All in all I would say above average for overall taste bit not a 'must have' burger. We were both stuffed. \n\nService was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Music was loud for the inside seating so if you want to talk the patio is the way to go.
5	Mmmm. I have found a new love and its name is yogartini! \nI love getting what I want and adding what I want and the combinations at this fro-yo shop are outstanding. It is a great place to have a treat and escape the AZ heat at the same time. \nI had the peach yogurt with berries and granola to top it off. My son had cookies and cream, marshmallow topping and cookies on top (with gummy worms...he is 3!). \nThe bad part it is that there is LESS guilt so you get more in your giant cup-o- yogart....but a treat is a treat, and this one is delicious!
3	I'm a cupcake connoisseur.  I truly believe they are one of the best treats one can have.\n\nWhen I travel (which is often), I find myself compelled to look for the best cupcake that city has to offer. After scouring Yelp!, I found Tammie Coe. It looked promising, but I found it odd that two locations so relatively close to one another differed in ratings and reviews as drastically as they did. So, I decided it was my civic (and culinary) duty to try cupcakes at both.\n\nThis location has Red Velvet, Ooey Gooey and Coconut available.  I opted against trying the latter because I'm just not a coconut fan.\n\nOoey Gooey -- One thing I enjoy about this cupcake is how jovial it is.  It is pure joy in small cake form.  They come covered in sugar crystals -- in a variety of colors!  This cupcake looked better than it tasted, sadly.  Now, it was good.  But it wasn't amazing.  The chocolate cake was a bit dry and the icing was somewhat pedestrian.  Perhaps I've become too much of a cupcake snob, but I sincerely cannot tell a lie -- when it comes to cupcakes!  Truth be told, I feel this cupcake suffered from being a tad too old -- and kept it far too cold of an environment.\n\nRed Velvet -- This is the cupcake I use as my way to judge all bakers.  This cupcake is a classic.  Now, Tammie puts a spin on this classic that is extremely unique.  Their red velvet is not made with traditional southern chocolate.  It seems they use a vanilla based cake for their red velvet.  While I'm not sure that constitutes this cupcake to be called a red velvet any longer, I will say -- WHO CARES!  Their red velvet in a sweet, vanilla cake with a vanilla cream cheese frosting that is coated in red sugar crystals.  It was moist, flavorful, not overly sweet.  It is a very fine cupcake. Not the best I've had -- but it is up there and deserves praise.\n\nOne thing I'd like to point out is that unless you order ahead, you need to buy your cupcakes at La Grange Orange Grocery (or LGO as the locals call it).  The service there was wonderful.  They even let me pick whatever color ooey gooey I wanted.  That being said, when we walked into Tammie Coe (not knowing we had to buy from LGO), we were treated fairly -- cold.  The woman in the bakery looked at us as though we didn't get the memo.  She spoke to us with great disdain and sent us packing.  It really put me off -- but, I try to just judge the food.  And since you don't need to deal with that bakery to eat their cupcakes, I'll just thank my lucky stars!
4	Brookstone is pretty cool.  They have the most random stuff, and that makes it even more fun to browse through the store.  The last time I was there, I saw the funniest exercise machine that was something you straddled and kind of 'rode' like a cowgirl or boy.  I think it's called the ihorse or igiddy-up. I really don't know, but it's close to that. \n\nThey also have the best memory foam mattresses.  They're heaven on a bed!\n\nIf you're looking for a gift for someone and don't know what to get them, come here! You're bound to find something unusual and cool because they have electronics, bed and bath items, kitchen items, all kinds of gadgets and much more.
3	My Cousin came in to town and stayed at the Wyndham so we all met up in the Icon for drinks before we started our night downtown.  My BF and I were the first people here, so that was pretty sweet, specially for 5pm on a Friday night.  Sad how dead downtown is right now.  Anywho, the bartender called in sick that night, so they had a stand in, who admitted he wasn't very good behind the bar.  For me, I like to know these things, when I'm in a lounge type place I normally go for the dirty martini's or specialty drinks, so it was nice to know not to order them as they wouldn't be that good.  I mean, dirty martini's don't sound hard, but people mess them up all the time, you have to get the perfect mix of olive juice and vodka.  Their happy hour last til 6, so we had some wine while waiting for our group to show, and then went off on our way.  I liked it, I did see people from behind the bar going to the bar for their drinks, which could be annoying, but the place was empty, I'd pretty much expect to go get it with that many empty tables.  I definitely wouldn't mind heading here to get my night started again.
2	"""Edible... that's how I'll describe this food. I ate it - cleaned my plate even. I had a lunch special which was a half-salad and a slice. The slice was a \runt\"""" as the waiter described it and swore most slices were larger - he then brought out a second \""""runt\"""" for half price to make up for the small portion of food. \n\nIt's a very generic place considering how much my girlfriend and friend raved about it. These are usually located in small corner strip malls and the decor is entirely forgettable. I had a good look at their bathroom and i thought it was nice and clean and they provided little shot cups so you could have a bit of mouthwash... classy. \n\nI should point out that I'm a pizza purist and prefer cheese or pepperoni or sausage or all 3, but not much else... I'm told that this place is great if you like a large variety of toppings. So take my review with that in mind.\n\nI thought the dough was bland and dry and unappealing. Flavorless, but capable of holding up the thin layer of toppings. I imagine they skimp on toppings because you are supposed to order many many toppings. That probably explains why the bread is sturdy. Still, my friend's slice was loaded, but looked sparse as well. \n\nThe cheese was also completely flavorless even though they sprinkled some parm on the top. The pepperonis were okay I guess - I like them thicker and more spicy though. The sauce was flavorless as well... overall a pretty bland and boring pizza experience. It reminded me of Dominos flavor-wise (or lack thereof).\n\nAfter eating, I was hanging out in the parking lot talking with my friend and my food suddenly hit me and gave me the shits - that's why I got a look at the bathroom. I wouldn't put money on it that it was definitely the pizza that gave me the browns, but it was the only thing I had eaten that day. It's entirely possible it wasn't the food though since I ate a bunch of candy the night before. \n\nAnyway - everyone's taste in pizza differs... I'm not a fan, but you may be. This place gets a 2.5/5 from me - it's pretty average. More experimental foodies might love it. People who like simple pizza may want to look elsewhere."""""""
4	Some delicious dishes at this place, but very uneven.  Start with the Stetson Chopped Salad, which is delicious.  But steer clear of the mushroom dishes.  They all sound delicious to me and everyone else I bring to Cowboy Ciao.  The restaurant itself is sure proud of them.  But they come out in a goopy sauce that steals the show, leaving the mushrooms as afterthoughts.  I now know why -- after sitting at the bar and watching the kitchen, the murshrooms come out of an enormous pot better suited for a prison kitchen than a restaurant like this.\n\nOk, I'm being too negative -- this restaurant has a lot going for it, but it's too uneven to really deserve the fourth star.
3	Traveling sure makes me hungry! After a long flight from Chicago I was just about to break into my 3rd bag of pop chips when it was time for lunch. Hooray!\n\nI joined the infamous Lindsey F and Gabi M for lunch here at Daily Dose. When we walked in Gabi told me it was a 3 star restaurant. I wasn't sure why we were eating at a 3 star restaurant when surrounded by so many fabulous dining establishments, but any food would do.\n\nWe were able to grab a table immediately, the menu is pretty extensive and our waitress was friendly. But yep..3 stars. My rock shrimp tacos sure beat another bag of pop chips, but weren't anything special.  And the friendly waitress forgot about our hummus appetizer.\n\nIf I was in the area I wouldn't hesitate to grab a quick bite or drink here, but nothing here to hop on a plane back to Phoenix.
3	Coming from a family where we have memberships at both competing bulk, membership only warehouses, at times it's pretty cool since both Sam's and Costco complement each other. Depending on the location you shop at, merchandise and certain brands differ. The prices at Sam's are comparable with Costco's, some things offered are cheaper or slightly more. \n\nLike Costco, depending on the time and day you're at their store, food samples are available for a bite. Unlike Costco, I think with Costco it's because of customer volume compared to Sam's the food samples handed out are much larger and at times snack size. Unlike their Wal Mart counterparts, Sam's for the most part is organized, and neat. \n\nAlso like the gas stations attached to the store. they're substantially less than regular gas stations. Their store hours are much later than Costco as well, until 8:30p M-Sat. Overall I enjoy my membership with Sam's Club.
4	A friend and I had dinner there on a Thursday night. I put in my name at 6:30pm and was told it would be a 2-hour wait and was asked to come back and check again in an hour. When we checked back, we decided to get drinks next door and ended up being seated less than 10 minutes later. So that wait-time people hype up... not as intimidating as it seems.\n\nWe were only a party of 2, and I regret not going with more people to try as many pizzas as possible. My friend got a salad with pears (or maybe apples?) and I got the prosciutto-wrapped cheese skewers. We shared a margharita pizza. It was exactly the right amount of food for us.\n\nMy friend loved the salad; the skewers were ingenius. Who doesn't like melted cheese on a stick?!!! The pizza was very tasty -- there was some kind of cheese, asiago or parm. reggiano? baked into the crust. Every bite was tasty, from beginning to end. The crust was perfecto.\n\nThe downside to eating here is that you'll smell like wood-burning garlickyness for hours after.
4	Have eaten here quite a few times now and have to say that so far this is my favourite Sushi Restraurant.....the food is consistently good, nice drink selection, wait staff are always happy, helpful and friendly...the atmosphere is relaxed and they usually have some good music playing. It may have just been the times I have been there...but it seems to be a bit dressier than other Sushi places....I have always been casual though and no one seems to be offended! lol
5	I can't really say anything that has not already been said. This place is fun, funky, and delicious. My go to sandwich is the Croque Madame. The egg on top is always cooked perfectly and its a big sandwich for your $$ ! I have yet to order here and NOT get a desert ( I can't help myself!!).... you really can't go wrong. I love all the cookies but the last few times I have been sucked in by the cupcakes..... banana bread cupcake with toasted coconut frosting... DONE! So moist and the frosting was killer ( but there is a lot of it) \nI love all the quirky gifts you can buy in here, and a lot of it is by local artists! I always get all my stocking stuffers here! My most recent purchase was a LGO hot/cold cup .... so much cooler than the Starbucks ones :) \n\nLove everything about this place! I really do... its my favorite place to stop after a hike up Camelback! ... really its just my favorite place to stop period. :)
5	My husband & I love going to eat here!!! We usually get a green olive and sausage pizza, ravioli and cannoli's.  Their food consistently tastes the same!!! I absolutely hate eating out where the food tastes different every time I eat there. Great customer service too and super friendly!!! They always stop to chat and seem very genuine!!! \nWe would recommend this you try it...you won't be dissappointed!!! Thank you for the special offer on YELP it was so appreciated!!! :)
5	Da Vang is 5-star food at traditional, 1-star prices.  I've never spent more than $10 here, and that usually includes at least one appetizer or dessert.\n\nThe service is the best I've had at a Vietnamese place.  Sure, there might be a pretty thick language barrier, but it's never gotten in the way of finding the perfect dish or having the order come out exactly as expected.\n\nOf course I'd recommend getting some Pho (stick with chicken unless you're either very adventurous or completely sure what the other ingredients are).  You can also keep it simple and delicious by getting a BBQ pork sandwich, like I almost always do (and if you really want to be like me, make sure to tell them no mayo).\n\nBut seriously, if you take one thing away from this review - TRY DESSERT.  I'm not a fan of the spongy-green cakey things, but the deserts in the cooler are usually very good.  I'd recommend any of the coconut-milk-based concoctions in the plastic cups.  Ask for a cup of crushed ice, pour the dessert on top, and enjoy.  Don't be freaked out - there will likely be some sort of beans, maybe seaweed, who knows what - but it will be delicious.\n\nDid I mention the people here are awesome?  Great food, great service, and your wallet won't be sore the next day (neither will your stomach).
1	Worst pizza I've had in the state of Arizona... no, wait... ever. I work in a hospital and I'd rather eat the dried out cafeteria pizza any day over this crap. \n\nI dont know who decided it was a good idea to change the name of the business on Yelp (it used to be Zzzzas Pizza) instead of closing Zzzzas and opening a new business as Piza, but it was a terrible idea. Now it looks like Piza Pizza has much better reviews than it does... don't be fooled. \n\nI walked in and the owner was short with me and rude when I asked him what kind of pizzas he had fresh for me to buy a slice. He told me he had every kind of pizza ready. Huh?? So, I ordered a piece of sausage pizza and watched as they threw some sausage on an old piece of pizza and sent it into the warmer/oven. It came out hard as a rock. Nasty. \n\nAlso, It's the month of June in Arizona and 110 degrees outside... it's about 120 degrees inside this place. He had the doors propped open and the ovens on. Looks like someone's a cheap ass trying to save on AC costs. Who the heck would want to dine at your restaurant?
2	Went here this morning for the first time.  A little hard to find driving down the road, there are no signs on the shopping center marque letting you know its there.  It's located in the Walmart Marketside shopping center.  \n\nHuge breakfast burritos, I got the Rivas breakfast burrito and it was very yummy.  Quick service and a big bonus having a Drive Thru!  Hours on front window say 7am-12am.  I will definitely be back to try lunch and dinner items.  Great little find in Surprise.\n\nSupplement to my original review: I went here again for dinner.  Ordered the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style and a Bean Tostada.  The Green Chile Bruiito was filled with pork meat that had more fat on it than actual meat.  Pretty gross.  The Tostada was mediocre at best.  Not sure I will eat here again for lunch or dinner.  \n\nIf your looking for a good breakfast burrito that has a drive thru, I would recommend, otherwise take your chances on the lunch/dinner menu options.
4	My family eats here about once a month, and the food is always delicious. I've been going to Benihana since I was a little girl, and it has never disappointed. At this location, the manager and wait staff are very nice. We typically request to sit in Lee's section -- he's extremely friendly and efficient. Even if we're seated elsewhere he'll stop by and say hi. I feel that personal touches like that make the experience even better. Also, the birthday club is very nice...they give you $30 off your meal!
3	"""We used to be regulars here...... until they fired their ONE pizza guy and sent him back to Italy for stealing food and wine (now there's a sign on the door explaining the there is no more wood fired pizza until they find someone that can do it).\n\nIt's pricey, but generally good (particularly the pizzas... but that aren't there anymore).\n\nBTW...... that \Italian\"""" server you're all talking about?  LOL!  His name is Rafael... and he's not Italian........... dark skin and a foreign accent doesn't equal Italian just because you happen to be eating Italian food at the time!  Cracks me up how many people love the authentic Italian waiter that doesn't exist!\n\nCheers!"""""""
5	"""They have a store upfront where you can pick up your own \Sause\"""" and/or Rub, and a breakfast taco if you're in a rush.   The meat is very high-quality and the Sauce to die for.  First had Rudy's in the late 80's brought in from TX, I was hooked.  What a treat having it local.  I went there last week around 12:30- they were giving the breakfast taco's away, that never happens before you wait in line to buy food.  They are generous with the protein and you will discover lunch costs more at McDonald's.\n\nDon't let the long lines fool you - it moves fast!"""""""
4	11/02/10\n\nHad an amazing happy hour, complete w/ dessert, here today!  Started off w/ red wine, an Apple salad, and Tuscan cheese board, and ended w/ a chocolate almond cake!  Service was quick and efficient, although it could've been a bit friendlier...  Don't know why they keep it so dark indoors-- 4:30p and it felt and looked like it was two hours later!\n\nI've had the Apple salad a few times before, so it's a fave when I dine here.  It's the first time I've had the cheese board, though, and I loved it!  On the dinner menu for $9.95, it only cost me $6 during happy hour and was comprised of an aged goat, a pecorino, and a gorgonzola dolce, a garnish of apricot jam, some apple slices, red grapes, and bread rounds.  The gorgonzola was the creamiest of the three, and the most pungent-- LOVED it!  The aged goat was semi-soft, was easily spreadable on bread rounds, and paired well w/ the apricot jam the best.  The pecorino was the hardest of the three cheeses, the saltiest, and paired well w/ the granny smith apple slices and red grapes.  A well-rounded platter that satisfied all of the basic tastes (salty, sweet, sour. and bitter), minus the umami element.  \n\nThe topper of this most excellent meal was the chocolate almond cake!  Alternating layers of almond-scented and chocolate cake, w/ layers of chocolate ganache between each cake layer, and then topped w/ more chocolate ganache, plus warm ganache on the plate, and sprinkled w/ toasted almonds!!  The almond cake layers were my favorite, as they definitely had the essence of almond throughout-- the chocolate layers didn't have any almond flavor at all.  I checked.  And checked again.  Nope-- the wonderful almond-goodness I enjoyed was in the light cake layers!  The warmed chocolate ganache and crunchy toasted almonds just sent me over the moon!  I'm so giddy now just thinking about it!\n\nThe photos included don't do this meal great justice.  BTW, I loved the cake so much, I ate that much AT THE TABLE.  I polished the rest off on the ride home!  :D
3	Overrated, overrated, overrated.\n\nThe food was OK, the service sucked, they don't have ranch dressing, and they don't  have any restrooms on site... which is unacceptable in my opinion.\n\nAfter waiting over an hour and listening to all the people raving about how good the food was outside, I had high hopes. My over easy eggs were soupy, more like under easy, nasty, and the guy next to me complained hes eggs were soupy as well. Something as simple as eggs should be cooked to perfection if this place was so good. The bacon and ham were pretty good, but nothing extra ordinary. The hash browns were soaked in butter and cooked with some short of pepper mix that tasted like crap. The pancakes were just pancakes with maple syrup, tasted exactly like pancakes from crackle barrel, whatever. The only thing at this place I can honestly say was the best I've ever had was the whole wheat toast. \n\nThe food was ok. If their wasn't a wait it would be worth eating at, but other then that, places like Chompies and The Breakfast Club are far superior.
5	I was on my way back to the airport and decided to stop by here to pick up something to go.  Holy crap...this place is awesome!  I'm usually not a fan of baked goods, but I can keep eating those Chocolate Chip Banana Muffins!  The muffin was really moist and had the perfect amount of chocolate chips and banana.  I also ordered a quiche muffin and it was quite good as well!  I definitely need Danielle to ship me some of those muffins on a weekly basis...I'm still craving them!
3	Its what you expect, burgers and fries.\n\nBut wait, there is more now.  There are sweet potato fries.  Yes, you heard it here first - sweet potato fries - yum.\n\nI find the drinks fun to look at and yummy to drink but a bit on the pricey side.\n\nHere's another great hint - they have smaller portion burgers!  I can never finish the whole regular burger so this is a great deal.\n\nComfortable easy place to be.  Someday I'll save room for dessert.
4	"""The name says it all.  This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.\n\nCochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a \torta\"""" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.\n \nThe other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).\n\nThe Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.\n\nThe Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.\n\nAs I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).\n\nThe pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.\n\nThe burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.\n\nI used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.\n\nFor example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least. \n\nAnother example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).\n\nThe best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.\n\nOverall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late."""""""
5	First review in a while, here goes. Went for a friend's birthday (well admittedly, I did plan it since I know my friends are a bunch of karaoke-loving Asians). I've been wanting to come here ever since it opened, since this is the first ktv-style karaoke place probably in the whole state! I think there is another one opening in downtown Chandler though. We went on a quiet Wednesday afternoon during our spring break, and we were the only group during happy hour. They were running an anniversary special (through the end of March) of $10 a person for 5 hours during happy hour, but their regular prices are not bad at all.\n\nThey had a fairly large selection of English songs, which is great since even though we're Asian, we're super white-washed. We were able to sing and sing until our throats were sore and our tummies wanted food; we didn't even get through everything on our playlist. Had a blast and hope to be back!
5	I followed the Yelp reviews and....Best frozen yogurt in the area hands down! Yogurtology made a fan out of me on may first visit. \n\nThe basics: their toppings bar is always well stocked, clean, and diverse. Wanna make it healthy? Go with fresh fruit. Wanna do a full on dessert? Add brownies or an oatmeal cream pie cookie as your base, then top it off with more candy and sauces.\n\nThe options are endless....\n\nThe flavors? Awesome! Seriously, the golden cupcake batter and oat meal cookie flavors make you forget this is low fat frozen yogurt! And the classic tart is on par with Pinkberry, and in my opinion better than Menchie's et al.\n\nWhat else? Well, the strawberry and chocolate shake flavors are so good, too. And one of my other favorites is easily the NY Cheesecake with a light dusting of graham cracker dust. It's all good! \n\nThe staff is great and will offer to let you sample. Some of the flavors rotate so try new ones! \n\nThey have the ingredients right there so you can see exactly what's in each flavor, and the caloric count is also up front. You can have a nice treat and still not wreck your diet if you pay attention.\n\nTip: join the free loyalty program for a few bucks off here and there.
3	"""Sauce is A~OK with a solid 3 star rating because the service is excellent their turkey and feta salad is amazing but their pizza is unique and just OK at best.  My son and bride would give them a 4 or 5 star rating for their salads and mac~n~cheese, but since this my review and I eat pizza, they are a 3 stars.  They are conveniently located in the Norterra Shopping area making this place a go to prior to catching a movie or doing some shopping.\n\nWe found it best to go when they are having their special (1 pizza, 2 drinks and a salad for $20) and it is a really good deal. The turkey and feta salad with turkey, feta, corn, cucumber, tomato, avocado & almonds is one of the best salads I've had at a pizzeria. They also have a new, very tasty Chicken, Spinach & Apple salad with gorgonzola and candied walnuts.  Yum!  Again my son says their mac~n~cheese is awesome and we like their little bread roles.\n\nWe've tried almost all of their pizzas and you would think having a name like \Sauce\"""" and advertising pizza as your specialty this would imply they have amazing pizza sauce.  But no, it's average tasting at best and there's barely any of it (sauce that is) or toppings on their pies.  There crust is good providing it's not burnt.  We've had to send a few back due to severe \""""char~age\"""" around the edges.  Don't get me wrong, it's decent pizza and the crust is surprisingly good for being so thin, but still I could go to Barro's and get a more filling pizza that tastes just as good for the money. \n\nThe service was great. It's one of those places that you go in, order at the register, pay and then pick a table, sit down and wait for your food to be brought to you.  Our food usually comes out quickly, so we are very happy with the service and can plan to see a movie after wards. \n\nGreat place to go for the value if they are having their special!"""""""
4	"""A ski-lodgey pizzeria. This says it all. Well, almost. While the decor may be a bit \weird\"""" and \""""puzzling,\"""" make no bones about it, the beer selection is great.\n\nLet's re-cap 2 of my experiences, shall we?\n\nDINNER:\n\nArrived shortly after 6 p.m. on a Saturday and sat in the bar area, which was littered with a few patrons. Live music started at 7 p.m. Since Saturday is considered \""""All Day Happy Hour,\"""" I went with a $5 sandwich - turkey, with smoked provolone. On the side, fresh fruit. They call this their \""""Half and Half.\"""" The sandwich was okay. Nothing I can't make at my own hacienda, though. I really liked the turkey, which like appeared freshly carved. The beverage: Sam Adams Summer ale, which was their seasonal at the time. \n\nMy family, who dined with me, thought the food was okay. When both my brother and my dad ordered beef, they weren't asked what temperature they wanted it cooked at. They were just given it well done. I would not have stood for that. \n\nOverall, the food is average \""""bar style\"""" food. The menu is large, though. It may take you several minutes to narrow down your choices. From calzones and burgers to sammies, you have options. \n\nJUST DRINKS:\n\nNow we're talking. If you're looking for a low-key place to hang for a couple hours, play some pool, watch some sports or hear live music, I would suggest checking out this place. They have two pools tables: one downstairs in the bar area; one upstairs. They also have a video game machine at the bar. (Beware that the pool tables were probably bequeathed to this place. After all, balls disappear. Where did the que ball go? Hmm.)\n\nAs for the beer, well... Let's just say they have quite the selection. You may not find your fancy imports here, but you will find some really great beers from some Oregon and Colorado microbrews. For that, this place goes up in rating for me (hence the 4 stars). After all, there's not may low-key places 'round town - especially close to home - that offer quite the array of beers to satiate my discerning tastes. I recommend you try The Great Divide Raspberry Ale, which is made with real raspberries. It's not overly sweet, but it's unique enough that you may find yourself, like me, craving it from time to time. Or, if you enjoy Rogue beer, they do sell the Dead Guy Ale on tap! \n\nSure, I list out their beers here, but that'll take up my entire character limit. Let's just say that on their drink menu, THREE WHOLE PAGES are devoted to beer - what you'll find both on tap and by the bottle. \n\nSO WHY GO? \nUhm, that's easy. Go for the great beer. (That's the main reason for the 4-star rating.)\n\nIf you love good beer, like I do, and want to chill with some friends, while playing pool or listening to some live jams (though the live music stopped at 9 when i went), then check out Boulders on Broadway. You may even find yourself thinking you stumbled through an invisible portal into a 1970's Denver ski lodge. Good times!"""""""
4	Went here again last weekend.  It was a spur of the moment choice!  The service was terrible this time around.  But the dessert wine was awesome.  Definitely try the 2006 Late Harvest Semillon, $8 for a small half-filled glass (which is expected of pricey Late Harvest wines).  My personal favorite wine is the 2006 John Anthony Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc, which they didn't have (can't seem to find it in AZ anywhere), but the '06 LH Semillon tastes very similar.
5	so we relax, sip from a bottle of wine, nibble on bruschetta, listen to pleasant music and test our knowledge with the trivial pursuit cards on the shelf. sometimes I wonder why we pay to go there when the whole experience could be replicated half price in the living room, quite enjoyably. \n\nBut we do! This is one of my favorite places in Scottsdale, despite the fact that I don't eat meat and all we ever get is the four non-meaty bruschettas. It is just pleasant here. The happy hour deals, comfy seating and knowledgeable/fun/friendly staff make it. Plus, wine!
1	"""It is old.  Walls are paper thin, it's almost like the noise from the hall and other nearby rooms is amplified.  Is that even possible?  The room did appear clean.  No security at all, just a young girl behind the front desk.  Doors to both streets wide open and vagrants milling around the openings, lounge, and lobby.\n\nThe worst part is the \manager\"""".  Shortly after checking in (mid-afternoon), we decided this is not going to work.  We took our luggage back downstairs and turned in the key, leaving the room exactly as it was when we arrived.  The desk clerk called the manager, who said we would be charged one nights room + a $50 early departure fee.  We asked to speak with the manager and were told she would not talk to us.\n\nEveryone else says this place is cheap, but a $170 charge for not even staying there seems a little pricing to me.  We are no having to dispute the charge with the CC bank."""""""
3	Good good, nice ambiance, so-so service.\n\nTook my bro and his wife for dinner, they had never been to Gallo. I'm not sure about you,  but when I say a spot is good, and I take new people there, I really expect and hope that my guests have a great time.\n\nSadly, the service at Gallo isn't the best. They used to have this amazing woman from the UK there, in addition to being super cute, she was a great server. Unfortunately, she is gone, and my time machine is broken.\n\nWe arrived at dinner around 6pm on a weeknight, and the place was about half full. It took quite a bit to get water, and a server to take drink and app orders. I ordered a beer, which for some reason took over ten minutes to arrive. I looked over at the kitchen area, and it looked like there were five employees doing sidework, and stuff that usually happens when the place is slow/empty. That's totally cool, but you would think taking care of customers would come first.\n\nThe food was good, my brother had some tacos, sister in law had a burro, I had shrimp tacos. I like the food, my guests did too, except that the chips got no love. They are pretty uninspired, cold and thick. Perhaps a new kind could be tried? The salsas are good, but the chips are like dollar theater nacho style.\n\nOverall, I recommended this spot, the food is worth it, and hopefully the service can pick it up a bit.
4	I didn't know this DSW existed up in North Phoenix until my regular DSW (Scottsdale) called them to hold a pair of cute sandals for me. This DSW appears to be larger than the Scottsdale store, which is always cool (we are talkin' about a shoe store here). The employees were helpful in this location just like the other one. \n\nIf you've never been in a DSW, it's a pretty large shoe store -- there's something for women, men, and kids here. Casual shoes, sneakers, flip flops, dress shoes, hiking sandals, heels, wedges, and -- \n\nTHE CLEARANCE SECTION!!  Woohoo!! \n\nI like this store, but parking leaves A LOT to be desired at this location; this store is in the same lot with a Target. Watch out for lots of pedestrians, kids with inattentive parents, and lonely shopping carts looking to make friends with your car's sheet metal...
4	Since I've always been a huge fan of Popeye and Olive Oil, it's no wonder I was drawn to this place... :)\n\nThanks to Robert M's review, I checked out QCOM's website and ordered a holiday gift for an out-of-state friend... the process was simple as can be and I felt safe using my credit card on their secure site.  \n\nI received confirmation via email a few seconds after the transaction went through... I hope my friend enjoys her Arizona made gift and I look forward to visiting Queen Creek Olive Mill sometime in person.  I'm sure it will be a fun little field trip!
5	So, we're in town on business and need a good Japanese food fix. We see rave reviews on Yelp. Got to give it a go, right? After eventually finding the Teeter House, we found the trip to be well worth it. The food was excellent! Service -- top notch! However, this is not your mom-and-pop Japanese diner. This is a quiet, quaint, spot for a special meal -- but not because of the cost, mind you. The prices are very reasonable. Although the dishes are not enormous, five guys left there very content for less than $30 pp total. Every dish was superb in taste and presentation. There was nothing that I wouldn't order again in a heartbeat. In fact, it'll be hard to go back and try something new because you will want to re-live some of those unique flavors again and again. Great find!
3	Now here's a screwball Sweet Tomatoes for you!  This thing looks like some odd metal farm building on the outside, & then when you step in, it's like a big food processing plant or something, with stainless steel all around, & a 2-story high open-beam ceiling with small windows way up at the top... very strange!  \n\nThey had some interesting goodies on the salad table today, including Curried Wheat Berries & couscous.  At the booth, my friendly server brought me some hot-from-the-oven chocolate chip cookies, & said that it would be ok to take them home if I wanted to.  With the aroma wafting off of them, though, it wasn't long before they were gobbled up, right in the middle of the meal!\n\nThis place is the opposite of the one on Ray Rd., if you go by the windows (they're huge & low down there), & the opposite of the one on Southern as far as getting to the food, & around the place without bumping into the other customes.  This one is open & roomy.\n\nI didn't care much for today's soup flavors, so it gets marked down a little.  Otherwise, it was fun, & YES they have delivery!\n\nLunch Buffet $8.39/$7.55 Sr. - Weekends $8.79/$7.91 Sr.
3	The one thing I really liked about this place is that it was super cheap.  I ordered a bowl of teriyaki chicken, veggies and rice and it was under $5.  Unfortunately about halfway through my bowl I got kind of tired of their teriyaki sauce and started to realize how overcooked my veggies were.  So I managed to satisfy my hunger but I had no desire to finish the entire bowl.  I'd give a few other items a try, maybe the spicy teriyaki is a little better?
5	"""Rock on Slippery Pig.  I  bought bike for my daughter and within a week  she got a flat.  She was crushed.  It was on a Saturday and I had heard about the Slippery Pig so I took  the bike up there.  The store was busy, but when he  saw my daughter, he  told me don't worry they would  get the flat fixed.  I returned that afternoon and when I walked in, the first thing he  said was  \are you the one that wanted your daughter's  flat fixed?\""""  I said yes, and he brought  the bike up front, flat fixed.  Could not have been  nicer, and  repair  was very reasonable.  These guys are great!"""""""
5	The workers there are very helpful and sweet. They have a huge selection of saltwater taffy and sugar free. There bulk selection is awesome. Love the fact that everything is wrapped. Nice Pezz area too. Prices are higher the gas stations but it's a candy store not a gas station so understand able. They are my favorite out of all the candy stores I have been to. And the prices are better too. I recommend checking in if you have foursquare. Best place EVER.
4	"""Even if you're only remotely interested in architecture and have only heard casual mention of the name Frank Lloyd Wright as a key figure in the history of American architecture, a visit to Taliesin West is well worth the roughly $30 and two hours you'll invest to take a tour. Well, actually there are about five different tour packages, but the \Insights\"""" tour we took lasted about two hours (90 minutes is the posted time) and cost about $30.   While we normally prefer to explore sites on our own, a tour is the only way to see this and there are enough packages to choose the one that works best for you.\n\nTaliesin West is an interesting, eccentric place, not unlike Mr. Wright himself, that really helps frame, even for we \""""mere mortals\"""" who are not architecture design experts, just how groundbreaking was his work for the time and place in which he practiced his craft and how much influence he's had on American architecture even to today. \n\nThe tours are led by docents and/or former students and all seem to be Frank Lloyd Wright acolytes which makes the time spent in tour fun for insights about the man as well as the work (really fun with the right tour leader as we enjoyed for our case). They make Frank Lloyd Wright come alive. Tour groups are large yet move through the facility at a brisk pace and questions were welcomed and well answered. One of the most common? You guessed it...what does Taliesin mean? (Tour spoiler alert...answer below. ;-) ) \n\nTaliesin West incorporates a big campus of multiple buildings and outdoor spaces with changing elevations but the tour is accessible to people using wheelchairs. It's not easy (as in the Getty Center in LA as stellar ease example) but it is possible. Given the length of the tour, wear comfy shoes. \n\nWe highly recommend going early in the day and taking one of the first tours of the day. Both for purposes of less crowds but also because outside of the gift shop these are not air conditioned spaces, obviously, and there are times when Scottsdale heat can be challenging. \n\nOur favorite location of the tour was the theater and we won't spoil the surprise by revealing in this review why that was so. A sort of heart tugging moment for both of us was to look out the windows of the house Wright and his third wife lived in during their time in AZ each year to the vistas of the magnificent Sonoran desert beyond and to think how beautiful a setting it must have been then and how much he might be discouraged to see the outlook now for the structures in the distance. \n\nNow here's the spoiler about the name Taliesin. It is a word of Welsh origination (his mother's side of the family was of Welsh descent) that means \""""shining brow\"""". You'll learn more about that on the tour and also why while Mr. Wright may have been a brilliant designer, he had his third wife to thank for keeping the enterprise moving.  You'll also learn why in addition to being an architectural marvel for its day the back story of Taliesin West also would capture attention on any one of the television tabloids in current times for the romance and crime associated with the complex \""""in the day\"""" were the same events to unfold \""""in the now\"""". \n\nNOW don't you want to go and learn more? :-)  \n\nAll in all, while this isn't a \""""go back to\"""" experience for us on every visit to Scottsdale (as the Desert Botanical Garden is, as example) we are very glad we did this once and highly recommend the fascinating experience to all visitors to the area. And make sure to spend some time in the book store / gift shop where the tour groups assemble...there are a lot of really interesting things to peruse there."""""""
4	My husband surprised me with breakfast take-out here a few weekends ago and I was a giggling mess. I had the perma-grin waiting for him to get back with my favorite item, the Salami Scramble. It is scrambled eggs mixed with sliced salami, with their awesome thick toast and your choice of hashbrowns or home fries. The jelly they give with the toast is delicious, as well. I can't say I am a huge fan of the potatoes as both the home fries and hashbrowns tend to be really greasy. That's okay, though, because the rest of the food is great. They also have thick-cut bacon you can order on the side that is pretty wonderful. I have eaten in the restaurant, sometimes, and I never had to wait too long and usually the wait seems to go by fast. Inside, the service is pretty efficient which at times can seem like they are pushing you out. But everyone is really friendly. I love that the farmer's market is right across the street which is great if you want to get out and have a nice breakfast before hitting the market. Matt's is closed on Mondays, FYI. Don't be like me trying to hit it up on a Monday off and throwing the collossal temper-tamptrum in the parking lot.
4	We've been here a couple of times, but just tried their happy hour for the first time, and I must say....I'm a fan!  $3 Margaritas and lots of cheap food items.  No wonder the patio/lounge is always packed!  We got there about 4:30 and we snagged one of a few empty tables, but anyone coming around 5 had to stand by the entrance an wait for a table to open up.  Because it's soooo busy during happy hour, service can be a little slow, but it's not because they're not trying.  Margs were decent and the sushi rolls I had were tasty!  We'll definitely be going back!
5	So glad we stumbled upon this place while we were visiting from California. Four Peaks was very good! The beer was extremely tasty & I don't usually care for beer. The food was also really tasty. I had the portobello veggie sandwich on beer bread and the stout-tiramasu. Both were delicious! I will definitely go back when I return to Tempe, AZ. The waitress was also very attentive & the atmosphere was fun!\n\nThe only bad thing @ Four Peaks is the parking! There isn't a lot, only street parking. \n\nThe prices were very reasonable & it seemed like a really fun hangout for the locals & ASU students.
5	We spent Easter in Arizona for the first time and all the natives suggested we try the burros at Carolinas.  The woman at the front was super friendly with the tourists from SF with the questions.  The place was clean and packed (Tuesday at 1pm) but it was  fast service.  We ordered three burros (3 way, green and red I think), two soft and two hard tacos (chicken). The burros were SUPER GOOD and my kids loved the tacos.  We ordered a dozen tortillas to take home - we were not disappointed! The prices were so reasonable...I wish Carolina's opened up in San Francisco....I miss it already...
4	Out of all of the Flo's locations, this is the one I've frequented the most over the past 3 years of living in the Valley.  I've seen the menu change here and there, but I have to say, I've never had a bad meal at Flo's.\n\nI met my friend Melanie H for dinner this evening and we really enjoyed our meal... we had great service - our waters stayed filled throughout the time we were there, and our food was served promptly. Our server checked on us several times as well.  We started with vegetable pot stickers and requested that they come steamed.  They were delicious! Next, we shared 'Indian Curry Vegetables' (I ordered it with shrimp) and Indian Vindaloo Chicken.  Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies, chicken, and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice.  The curry vegetable dish came with broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and long beans.  The chicken dish had tomatoes and onions. We also had steamed white rice.\n\nNote to Flo: We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari. One more thing - the chicken corn soup that you serve at the DC Ranch location should be offered at the others as well - I love that soup!\n\nFortune cookies came along with the check and we both were happy with our fortunes.  The bill didn't break the bank either.  See you again soon, Flo!
5	Came here for a wedding!!  It is beautiful there.  The staff is extra friendly and super helpful.  And great with directions (the place is huge, you need directions).  They even have electric carts that drive around the ground to pick lost souls.  LOL!  \n\nThe pics look fabulous!   Our friends had an outdoor wedding next to the body of water with a ball decoration that has fire and flowing water (Great back drop for pics).  We hung out at the outside area for drinks, pics, and chats after the ceremony.  Then we were led to the banquet room.  The place was very nice.  The servers were awesome.
3	I am not in love with this place nor do I despise it.\n\nI am Mr. Middle-of-the Road with Stacy's.\n\nSomethings he does very well, others are just so-so.\n\nHere are the Do's and Don'ts-\n\nDO-Order a sweet potato pie to go. That happens to rock the house!\nHave the pulled pork sandwich. Solid sandwich.\n\nDONT--Do not and I mean DO NOT order the chicken BBQ sandwich. I ordered this a couple months ago and I could have used the shredded chicken as toothpicks. They were hard and came served in a weird cone-like shape on the bun. Also, skip the sweet potato fries. They are dry and taste like dirt. Yep, I said it. Sorry Stacy. Back to the drawing board on those.\n\nThe sauce is everything at a BBQ joint and his is just OK. Actually, I have had better in a store-bought bottle from AJs.\n\nIf you are in the area, go for it. If you live out in Glendale, it's probably not worth the drive. I am not sure what Bon Appetite was thinking when they gave this one of the top 10 new BBQ joints of 2009.\n\nThe lady who works behind the counter is funny as hell and is a total sweetheart! \n\nBTW--CASH MONEY only!
4	"""Last night I went to The Melting Pot with three girlfriends for a special \Girls' Night Out\"""" event that they marketed. There was a set menu, and the price was $29 per person with a few options for $5 martinis. If you wanted a drink that wasn't on the set menu, you paid extra. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted outside by two very bronzed girls who were promoting Planet Beach tanning salon. They gave us as many samples as we could carry (for those of us who wanted tanning lotions and such) and had a entry form for a free month of tanning.\n\nWe had reservations for 6:15, so we were seated promptly. Our waiter, Cody, came over to introduce himself and explain how things were working that evening. When we asked about the other activities outside (we had seen girls getting paraffin dips and hand massages and eyebrow waxing in the courtyard), Cody told us that we could participate after dinner. Angela, our friend who made the reservation said when she called they told her we could get those services until 10 PM. So, we relaxed.\n\nWe ordered our cheese and cooking options and then some drinks. The drinks took forever to arrive. Seriously. We had almost completely finished our cheese fondue by the time the drinks arrived. \n\nThe cheese option we selected was a spinach and artichoke white cheese concoction that was delicious. But isn't anything with cheese delicious? :-)\n\nThere were several times when we complained (to ourselves) about our lack of drinks. Later, when one of our friends said she would want to order another martini in about 5 minutes, our waiter said, \""""I should probably go put it in now, though, considering how backed up they are.\"""" We thought, 'Oh wow, they are really busy with this promotion.' Turns out they had no glasses. In fact, the Ahwatukee location had to run over glasses for Scottsdale. I thought it very odd that the restaurant would advertise a big Girls' Night Out event and not be prepared for ladies wanting drinks. Oh well. \n\nWe choose the basic bouillion cooking style, and our plates contained sirloin, filet, chicken, shrimp, butternut squash ravioli, and an assortment of veggies. It was a ton of food! We were not expecting to get so much at the discounted price. \n\nOur chocolate fondue choices were limited to milk, dark or white. Three of us were up for dark and one wanted white, so Cody was nice enough to bring her a little bowl of white chocolate. We had a ton of dessert .... And it was delicious.\n\nMeanwhile, a woman from Mary Kay came over carrying a basket of what looked like presents. She asked us if we had heard about the drawing yet, and we said no. She said, \""""OK, well, I'll just leave these entry forms here with you.\"""" And, she did. But, she never told us what the drawing was for .... and she never returned. She asked us \""""Does anyone have any Mary Kay products in their purse.\"""" One of my friends did, and she got \""""a prize\"""" - one of the presents. Then she asked us, \""""Does anyone have any lipstick at all.\"""" We all did. We all got \""""presents.\"""" Our present was a bag of marketing materials, which was kind of a let down. \n\nNext, the bill. This got a little weird because there were additional charges on our bill that didn't make sense to us. We paid with three credit cards, and all I know is I was charged $6 more than I should have been, and my friends who had either higher priced drinks or multiple drinks paid less. We asked the waiter about some of the charges, and apparently one of the drinks ordered was not on the set menu and was therefore extra. Though, we had asked about making an adjustment and he never said it would be more. \n\nWe excitedly went to the courtyard for our treatments and discovered that everyone was either gone or was cleaning up! And it was still early! That was a bummer ....\n\nSo, overall, the food was great, and it was so nice to connect with friends over a leisurely dinner. The price was perfect - about $40 a person when you consider drinks and tip - and if they do another such event, I will go again, but try to arrive early to make the most of the activities."""""""
5	Yasu has quickly become my favorite Japanese restaurant in town.  The first time we ate there, my wife and I had the sashimi lunch plate.  I was totally blown away by the quality of the hamachi.  Absolutely the freshest yellowtail I've had in Phoenix.\n\nSince then, we've eat there several more times for lunch and three times at dinner and every time it's been incredibly good.  Just the simple tuna roll is the best I've had in Phoenix also.  Super fantastic food.\n\nAs for price - any good sushi restaurant is going to be expensive, but we've spent as much or more at lesser quality restaurants like Sakana.  Also, $1.50 for soda nowadays is fantastic.  And, having Echigo beer is a definite plus.\n\nYasu has a great atmosphere, though I wish they had a longer sushi bar where you could watch the chefs do their thing.  We regularly bring our 11-year-old son who loves sushi and that's no problem.  The noise level is acceptable, though expect long waits if you show up on a weekend night without reservations.\n\nIf you like Sushi at all, please make your way to Yasu - it's well worth almost any drive.  I can't wait to go back!
3	"""Pint of Sam Adams is about $7.50 and they are really really good about checking IDs... even senior citizens get carded. \nI'm putting this up here because I definitely was searching for the price of a drink before I came here and couldn't find it. \n\nI had to wait for a friend to pick me up from the airport so I decided to stop by here and grab a bite to eat. For the same price of what you'd be paying at one of the other fast food joints in the mall you get a nicer place to sit. \n\nThere is a choice to sit at the bar, table or booths. They even have a few arm chairs. I was first seated at a table by the entrance to the restaurant but asked to move towards the back area in a booth. It took a little bit of time before the waitress came over to check on me. The service could have been better... I'd give it 2.5 stars. After my food was served, the waitress never came back to refill my water glass, but she did come by once to ask if the food was alright and then didn't come back until she saw that I was done with my meal. \n\nI ordering the chicken bowl. The\spanish rice\"""" was bland but luckily it came with a queso sauce that was really flavorful - i thought the flavor was similar to a smoked chipotle. The bowl definitely could have used more of this flavoring. The grilled chicken was decent and not dry. The bowl came with a choice of salsa - I chose hot... it was a really small amount of salsa. It also came with a couple of well-salted chips that were crisp and not too oily. \n\nI ended up ordering a pint of the Sam Adams after my meal was done and asked my waitress if it'd be alright if I sat there and read for a bit. She said it was okay. I was good for about 10 minutes then the waitress let me know that she was clocking out and asked to close out my tab and told me that I could open up another tab with the next waitress if I wanted anything else...  after I paid my tab I was sitting there reading and while nothing was said to me and there were still open table, I couldn't help but feel like I was taking up valuable table space in the new waitress's section, esp because she never introduced herself or anything. I sat for about 10-15 minutes kind of nursing my drink - in part because I was full and in part because I really didn't have anywhere to be. Maybe I was being paranoid but I dunno it seemed like the wait staff looked a lot in my direction. I had originally chosen this place because another yelper had mentioned they had eaten a meal here and then comfortably waited for his/her connection.. definitely didn't feel comfortable but maybe that's just me. Maybe I would have felt differently if I had moved to a lounge chair."""""""
5	Here I go. First off, I feel this if the best pho on the west side. I've tried them all. The broth is not at all bland like some of the reviews state. IT'S PERFECT!! The owner is a very nice man, always waves when I walk in & that's good enough for me. The spring rolls are awesome. I think what some people are use to is how some other places put oil on their noodles, that right there will give it flavor. I myself workout & eat healthy so I'm really conscious what I eat. If you're looking for pho loaded with MSG or broth that taste like sugar water, then this isn't your place. If you're looking for a healthy bowl of pho then this is your spot. This is my opinion & I will only eat here for a bowl of pho....its a 25 min drive from my house but well worth it.......FYI, I can't speak for their other dishes, only their pho......Thanks for reading!
4	"""I've been looking for a real, \authentic\"""" mexican food place in Phoenix since I moved here a year and a half ago, and this place is the best I've been able to find. The fact that it's about 3 minutes away from my house makes it even better!\n\nThe first thing I love about this place is the albondigas soup. It's AMAZING. It's just your basic vegetable soup with carrots, potatoes, celery and squash and best of all, MEATBALLS! The broth is very flavorful and always super hot!\n\nThere are whole bunch of things I haven't tried on the menu because I always go for one of the combination plates. I get a mixture of either the enchiladas, tamales, tacos or burros because they're all so equally good! The plate is served with a hefty serving of rice and beans (the rice could maybe use a little work but the beans are great!) \n\nGet an order of chips and salsa! The salsa has this hint of mint to it that I've never tasted before and sometimes I go here just to get chips!!  All in all, great food, GREAT PRICES and great service."""""""
2	Pretty unimpressed here.  I came looking for a two row Rondo to test drive, being very clear I wasn't going to buy today.  They didn't have any two row, so I told them I'd be happy to drive a three row to get an idea, but that I didn't want a three row.\n\nWe were left in the lot for a good 10-15 minutes while Shaun went to get the keys. Then he came back with some incredibly energetic sales manager who said two words to us, and bounced back inside. I have no idea why he even came out -- perhaps to try and read us?\n\nTest drive was ok, but the dealership isn't near a highway, so I didn't get to try it out on the open road.  Fine, whatever. We went inside to get a book on the Rondo, and while I went to the restroom, a finance guy accosted my partner. She was very clear we didn't want to get a car today, but he pestered her till I came back, then he pestered me. \n\nHe told me he'd get me a great deal on the 3 row. I told him I didn't want a 3 row. He persisted.  He offered to give me some numbers (other dealerships had), but to do so, he wanted to do a credit check. I explained that other dealers had run some just generic numbers, and I didn't feel comfortable having a credit check run for a car I didn't even want. He kept pushing, until I finally told him point blank that I was the kind of customer he hate, the stubborn bitch who knew what she wanted and couldn't be goaded into buying now, or buying something other than what I wanted, and that he should back off.  He got up and left.\n\nNeedless to say, should I decide to get a Rondo, I will NOT be patronizing this dealership.
1	"""stay far away from this place,  you'll get what you pay for with the 100 dollars for the year membership, they handle the crowds by being as cold and unwelcoming as possible, non-members stay away!!!!!!  on Saturdays and Sundays it  is extremely crowded and employees will do everything they can to make sure that you do not \get in the way\"""" of the members. (be prepared to get kicked out).  It is more like an NRA cult then a gun club, don't waste your time or money, there are plenty of professional gun clubs in AZ do not even consider this one as an option."""""""
5	My partner and I had our anniversary dinner at Cafe Monarch last Sunday.  It was a wonderful experience.  Chef Chris was very charming.  The weather was cool and he had a couple of outdoor fireplaces going with fragrant pecan wood. We had the whole place to ourselves outside!  It was very romantic.  The food was simply outstanding--we placed ourselves in his oh so capable hands!!\nWe are already looking forward to going back with some friends.  Plan ahead on your dates and you will not be sorry!!  This special place has been discovered.  Enjoy the experience!!
4	Yum yum love me some!\n\n\n\nThis place has wonderful, I mean wonderful chicken parmesan!  I was worried when the sigh, then the menu changed, worse yet they changed the sauce!\n\nBut... we sat down, our fear put aside and ordered out favorite dishes. They tasted better! The chicken parmesan and the sausage rigatoni are amazing as they ever were. \n\nService has never been a problem and the take out as well is extremely convenient.\n\nSincerely, a loyal customer, what ever the name is or changes to :)
3	"""Yelp Eats Week 2011 (50% off!), Take 2:\n\n07/13/11\n\nWas \in the neighborhood\"""" (Tempe) and thought today would be the perfect day to try an east valley participating restaurant I probably would never even contemplate driving to from all the way in north Scottsdale.  Looking over my list of possibles (whose menus intrigued me online... OK, let's face it-- whose menus offered me a few items I could ACTUALLY eat, due to my food allergies), and I chose Jimmy's of Chicago.  I was sure I'd come face-to-face w/ a dive-y sports bar, but the food photos I'd seen on their Yelp profile begged to differ, so I decided to surprise myself.\n\nAnd what a pleasant surprise it was!  (To those using Navigation app to locate this place, ignore directions saying to turn right on Pecos traveling on Gilbert Rd. off of the 202E and just continue on, making the first right into the complex past Pecos.)  I arrived just in the nick of time, as a couple was just walking out and the elderly man held the door open for me.  Please note that this is one heavy door!  Upon entry, I indeed was met w/ a noisy and dive-y sports bar, but I'd asked to be seated somewhere less noisy and was directed to a room that was reminiscent of a living room filled w/ dark furnishings-- I think there may even be a fireplace in there, but I could be wrong.  This room won't disappoint those who arrive w/ their families, who don't want to, or can't sit by the bar, and yet want to catch some sports action, as I counted 5 (that's FIVE) mounted flat-screens!  \n\nOn to the food!  I arrived just before 6p, so I was able to take advantage of their happy hour special of $5 a glass of house wine- my choice was the chardonnay.  I decided to go w/ the Frazalle-cheta to start, the homemade ricotta cavatelli w/ vodka sauce for my main course, and the (only homemade dessert choice on the menu) tiramisu to finish.  A serving of warmed bread and butter arrived even before the wine appeared- nice!  It wasn't long before the app arrived, and was it a pretty sight to behold!  A ring of toasted old-style bread, brushed w/ butter and garlic, surrounding a nice presentation of pepperoni, fontinella, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, and halved grape tomatoes w/ homemade vinaigrette.  The bread felt a bit stale to me, so I mentioned it to the server, who said that the dish is made from an old peasant recipe that calls for day-old bread that is softened and is something they tried to recreate here.  So, I tried to ignore the staleness.  Otherwise, the rest of the dish was very good!  (I was only able to get a photo of the app, as my battery was too low to take pics of the entree and dessert, which actually turned out for the best, as the entree wasn't much to look at...)  A few pieces of bread and bruschetta toppings, and I was ready for the pasta.\n\nThe entree included my choice of soup (minestrone, escarole and beans, fagioli) or salad, and I went w/ the salad, choosing the homemade strawberry vinaigrette.  If you like strawberries, then you will love this vinaigrette-- it tasted as if I was eating sweet pureed strawberries!  The veggies were fresh and crisp.  It's a good thing I wasn't planning on eating much of it, bec. the bowl wasn't even on the table for two minutes, when my cavatelli appeared- no exaggeration!  As I've mentioned before, the cavatelli wasn't much to look at.  The pasta looked very white and pasty, while the vodka sauce was thick and had a terra cotta matte-d hue going on.  I like ricotta, so I found it palatable, but very bland, so I quickly put the table-side parmesan and red pepper flakes to good use.  A few forkfuls of this and I was ready for something sweet!\n\nThe portion of four-layered homemade tiramisu offered here originally for $5.99 is very small (around 3.5\"""" x 2.5\"""" x 2.5\""""), so it's a good thing I paid only $3 for it.  It's very good, even w/o the Hershey's chocolate sauce drizzled on top (I had it on the side).  Loved the strength of the liquors used, as well as the textures of the sweetened ricotta and espresso-drenched chocolate lady-fingers.  Mmm...  I'd like to have another, please!  \n\nI may be talked into visiting Jimmy's again before Yelp Eats week is over...  Another table's braciole w/ mostaccioli (flank steak, tomato sauce, and penne) looked good, despite the dollop of tomato sauce.  (Again, what's w/ the sauces' presentation here?  This seriously has to be addressed!)  If nothing else, I'd like to try the stuffed artichoke app and have a go at the Coocizza (you guessed it- your choice of chocolate chip, Reese's peanut, or white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie w/ ice cream on top).  I also spotted a breakfast menu!  Now, if only I'd get a chance to make it to this area early enough..."""""""
4	This place is nice. Really, really nice. I came here for lunch and ordered up a bunch of sushi, and the service was great. Every single person who was employed here took a minute to at least say hi to me, and the environment was really warm (maybe just because it was slow, but it was impressive nonetheless). I never wanted for anything- the sushi chef was extremely attentive and personable, and my server made sure that my tea was hot, my water was topped-off, and a smile was on my face. \n\nThe sushi was fine. Full disclosure- I had JUST brushed my teeth before coming, so I had a little bit of a minty mouth when I sat down to eat and I'm sure that affected the taste a bit. The unagi was perfect- oh-so-slightly crispy at the edges, succulent and warm in the middle with a very nice, unobtrusive sauce. The shiromaguro also had a really nice sauce to it, which I'm not used to on white tuna- but it was really nice. The ikura seemed a little bland, without the pleasing brininess and juicy pop that I usually enjoy. I will say that I was a little disappointed in the snow-crab used in the California rolls- usually when you see specific crab labelled it comes out as a solid stick of scrumptious leg-meat, but this was shredded and possibly from the claw, without much flavor. The rice was fine, but could have been a little more vinegared... but like I said, my tastebuds were a little off-center, so I'll have to come here again before I can really evaluate it.\n\nAll that being said, the exceptional friendliness of the staff was more than enough reason to give this place a solid four star. Maybe I just caught them on a good day, but service like that needs to be recognized! Thanks folks!
4	I pretty much outgrew Ikea about ten years ago, when I used to go to the one in Elizabeth, New Jersey.  I think our style has evolved and Ikea's stuff is particle board and not wood.  I prefer more durable, kiln-dried hardwood pieces.  That said, I have been here a lot recently.\n\nWhy?  \n\nWell, I recently bought a much smaller home than I've ever had.  That means I have way too much stuff with way too little room to put it into.  Solution?  Ikea.  \n\nI bought a few pieces of storage for my room that are about 8 feet tall.  They nearly tripled the amount of space I had in my dresser.  \n\nI also bought some lighting and mounted it on my wall on either side of my headboard, hotel style.  I eliminated my bedside tables in favor of a sleeker hotel look which encourages less clutter.\n\nDD likes the Ikea play place, though every time I allow her to play in there we SCRUB her from fingers to wrists and wash her face the moment I get her out of there.  The last few times she played there, she was sick exactly three days later.  I'd love to keep her out of there altogether, but you try telling a four year old she can't play with other kids because of germs.  Good luck with that.\n\nIkea is really family friendly and even offers free meals for kids on Tuesdays.  I often see people with large broods hanging out in the Ikea cafe for just that reason.  If you have a baby and find yourself unprepared, they actually have different sized diapers in their restrooms.  Very cool.  \n\nOverall, I like to check out the stuff they have at Ikea and I will occasionally buy little tchotchkes there.  Is it high end?  Definitely not.  Is it durable?  Meh.  But they are successful for a reason.\n\nTIPS: \n\n1.) Go on a weekday before 5.  If you must go on a weekend, go RIGHT at opening to avoid the crowds.\n2.) Get their Family card.  Aside from getting discounts on a handful of items in the store, you also can get free coffee/tea on every visit and other specials, as they arise.\n3.) If you're looking for a cheap meal, they have a $1.00 hot dog and a drink meal downstairs by the checkouts.  \n4.) Mondays between 9:30 and 11:00 they offer free breakfast to everyone in their cafe.
2	"""I used to frequent this place years and years ago when it was Le Petite Caf\u00e9 so decided that I might as well try this new place. It's completely gutted from when it was the other restaurant and has a very open but hipster feel to it. The menu is on boards as soon as you walk in and you go further up to place your order with the waitress. Number in hand, you sit anywhere and someone delivers the food when you're ready. I've been to places like that before but it's still a weird concept for a \sit down\"""" place.\nI got the Sunrise Sandwich which is basically runny eggs and ham with cheese on toast and a side of pan-fried rosemary seasoned potatoes. The sandwich was really good with plenty of ham and a lot of flavour but, and I say this as a potato lover, the potatoes were not edible. They were rubbery and flavourless like they had been sitting under a heat lamp all morning. This wouldn't bother me from a place like Denny's but if I'm going to be paying nearly $8 for something I can make at home at a fraction of the cost, I expect high quality and flavour.\nAlso tried the Italian coffee and cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was very fluffy and had a good helping of frosting on it. I liked that they didn't melt the frosting over it. The coffee was very good but a little costly at over $2 for self-serve no-frills coffee. Even Starbucks is cheaper than that. \n\nOverall, much left to be desired. Decent food but I've had more satisfying experiences at iHop at much better prices.  I can only assume all the high ratings are from people who aren't super into breakfast like me. It's my favourite meal so I know when it's lacking.\nI'll continue mourning the loss of the little cute France-themed breakfast joint that was."""""""
5	A few weeks back a friend came to one of my board game nights and brought along an apple cider I had never seen before. It was delicious, so a few days later I popped by Top's to see if it was available. I couldn't find any on their shelves so the guys up front took down the name of the drink and my number, promising to give me a call if they could scare some up.\n\nLess than a week later my phone rings, it's the folks at Top's letting me know that they have this awesome new cider in stock. I can't think of any other place that will turn around a customer request so quickly, this has locked me in as a loyal customer. Their prices might be a bit higher than a big-box store, but supporting a local business with amazing service is entirely worth it.
4	I was elated when I saw the new Nellos go up in Old Town.  If you like Nellos anywhere else in the valley and havent been to OT, race your pretty little face over there tonight.  For salad.   I too am not a huge fan of their pizza and I cant put my finger on exactly why but I think it has something to do with the sauce...  Just not what I get excited about.  But the upgraded garlic bread with cheese and tomatos paired with their amazing and very generous spinach salad...now there is a food worthy of blowing your diet over.  The atmosphere at this location in particular is better than the others, plus its in Old Town so less screaming children means more happy hour fun for you and me.  Rumor has it they have live music there sometimes too.  Parkings a bitch at high traffic hours but isnt it at any OT hotspot?  Get over it or road trip it up to Shea or down to Tempe for other fine locations.
4	Wednesday night happy hour (which lasts until 11pm)...was relatively busy for this day/time.\nHoly smokes, they're not shy with the alcohol in their drinks. After one, I was done! Seemed to be the consensus with everyone who was drinking...\nAlso tried the coconut shrimp rolls, which weren't too shabby. Sauce was supposed to be pineapple/horseradish, but didn't seem at all horseradishey. \nOur server (Katherine) was great! On top of refills, food orders, friendly, and fast! Bar itself was nice, was showing reruns of Gilligan's Island. Great patio seating, especially this time of year!
4	I was thinking they deserved a 3.5 star review, so I'll err on the side of generosity as they are certainly one of a kind. If it's your first visit, tell them so you can get the menu tour, which is some of their more popular items. You fill your order out on a card and hand it over to the cashier, which then reads it back to you so I don't see how it really saves any time.\n\nThere are seemingly countless options, as they have 15 entrees, each one can come alone, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla, and you get two entrees in a combo platter. The platter also comes with your choice of 5 rices and 2 beans (don't bother with the pinto, go for the house-recipe Cuban beans). My wife and I agree that the Jade Red chicken is the best (and the menu proclaims it as the most popular). Their Jerk chicken is very spicy, but the jerk fried rice has just the right amount of heat.  All entrees come with fresh baked snickerdoodles (or on Saturdays, the option for a chocolate cookie). \n\nAfter ordering, you find a seat in the cafeteria-style dining room, or outdoors on a nice day (not July or August). The location is tough to find though, hidden in the back behind a Walgreens and Brake shop. Still, it's worth the small hunt. I've been back several times since, but others I've brought with me have mixed thoughts on the food.
3	I'm dropping Ranch House Grill into the diner category, and in that category they rate a nice 3 stars.\n\nThe service was prompt and friendly, the prices were fair and the food was pretty good.\n\nThe huevos rancheros with roasted pork green chili was very tasty.  I would probably get that again if I were dining at Ranch House Grill again.\n\nThe diced green chili and cheese omelet was less impressive.  The green chili in the omelet didn't have alot of flavor and the omelet itself needed more cheese.  The shredded potatoes were nice and buttery but I like them with some crispiness, at least on the top and bottom.  These were a bit soggy but still good.  They just needed another minute on the grill.
3	It is important to point out that Blue Adobe Grill is not a Mexican restaurant, it is a New Mexican restaurant. While that may seem to be an unnecessary clarification, it is actually fairly important to keep in mind as you visit. \n\nFor a New Mexican joint, it is pretty dang good and true to the region, but food a sit-down Mexican joint it would be disappointing. In order to maintain full disclosure, it has been a couple of years since I went here last, but it has been around for years so I can't imagine much has changed. Overall I would recommend it to people who don't have expectations of a certain type of food. It's good but nothing memorable.
4	"""Mmmm--me likey! \n\n I found this on Yelp and was glad to find a BBQ place so close to my daughter's apartment I'm visiting.  I was the designated child care for my new step-granddaughter this afternoon so I said, \Hey, let's go out to lunch!\""""  We headed for Andrew's 2nd location on Southern near Dobson.  First impression--specious, clean, bright, cheerful. \n\n The Kids Meal seemed a little high at $5 till I saw what she got--about ten little mini corn dogs (she only ate two, though she liked them, just eats like a bird), huge pile of excellent fries, and drink of choice (chocolate milk). The mini corn dogs were fixed really well, deep fried like little fritters, crunchy and crisp.  I got a BBQ pulled pork sandwich on a hamburger bun with one side (cole slaw) also for $5.  The pork was tender and non-greasy, had wonderful mild flavor, and the BBQ sauce, which you pump as much as you want out of a big jug, had great flavor.  There was a spicier version available if you preferred. Cole slaw was very good--I forgot to ask if it was homemade by them but it tasted like it could be.\n\nThe girl behind the counter was very cheerful and didn't rush me in choosing.  She said she usually works at the Guadalupe location but I'm glad she was here today.  \n\nAs we sat and ate a leisurely  lunch I looked around and started noticing all the rock and roll posters and even album covers that seemed to be from the 70's and 80's, maybe a couple of 60's.   That added kind of a unique touch to the place.\n\nIf I lived in this area, I would definitely be frequenting this place!"""""""
4	My husband and I had several of their happy hours sushi rolls, including Spider Roll (soft shell crab is quite good there), Philadelphia roll, tuna sushi, spicy crab roll, shrimp tempura roll...all for about $23.\n\nHappy hour is a good deal & I recommend it!\n\nMost days I've been there, it's been really good.  I went last week and it was average.  Today, it was good again.  Maybe the sushi chef had a bad day, or I don't usually get the sushi chef I had last week.
4	Had lunch here for the first time and was pleased to know that everything is organic and vegan unless you choose to add dairy or eggs to the meal. \n\nI ordered the Smokey Tempeh B.L. T. (see pics) \n\nFirst of all the portion was HUGE! Generous helping of Exotic Veggie Chips and a side salad along with a sprinkling of cherries Plus this Amazing Sandwich. I do mean it was AAAMMAZIIIING!! \nSeriously, the Tempeh Bacon was practically like tender BBQ Beef Brisket, it was quite a magical moment for my taste buds. \n\nMy salad came with a side of Living Caesar dressing, which is all raw vegan ingredients, it was a little spicy for my taste so I asked for the Pomegranate vinaigrette, YUM! Sweet, Tangy and a little zing from some fresh mint it was much more to my liking. \n\nI'm just ecstatic that there is something so Veganly Delicious ( it's my review so I will make up words if I want to)) so close to home.\n\n 4 stars for now, until I try more items, but that sandwich was so 5 stars!
4	Pappadeaux has been my go to ever since I moved here.  I remember spending a night at their bar watching Kim blow the D-Back's lead in the World Series while eating some fried alligator.  \n\nSince then I have learned to appreciate food more and have become quite fond of Pappadeaux, especially during happy hour.  Pappadeaux's has never let me down in regards to food.  When you sit at the bar the service is sometimes, more often then not, lacking (hence the reason for only four stars).  \n\nYou can't go wrong with the Oysters, and their Po' Boys are on point.  If you are there for dinner anything you order is sure to please, but maybe try the seafood platter.  Pretty sure we have sampled most of the menu, which does change.  If you have never had Alligator, try it!!  I can go on and on, but again I don't remember a menu item I did not like or would not recommend.  Me not being a dessert fan it is hard, but I would recommend the key lime pie.\n\nPappadeaux's you are a treat, thank you for the fresh product and refreshing drink.
5	"""I had my hair done last week by Christa and it is the best hair extension micro link install I have ever had. Actually, it's the best hair extension install in general I have ever had which means something coming from me because I have been wearing hair extensions for over 10 years and have probably had extensions done by over 20 stylists. She took out my old extensions and put new ones in. There was no discomfort in the application and it doesn't even feel like I have extensions in. She laid them just perfect and had my 5\ hair 22\"""" without it looking like a really bad mullet. Everything blends well, I do not have that shelf look which can happen when one has short hair and long hair is added. I love my hair and will continue to use her as my regular stylist."""""""
3	We've dined here before and opted to get some food to go from this restaurant instead of Pei Wei and Panda Express.  I just get sick of the food at those businesses.\n\nIt's a skeleton staff but polite, knowledgeable and efficient.\n\nThe bar options are very limited and I'm not sure if it's because of a pending delivery or what.\n\nAt China Max, every time we have dined or had take out it has been good. \nWe have a couple of favorite dishes that got our attention when they were lunch specials - Mango Shrimp and Garlic Chicken.\nTonight we went with Pot Stickers and two orders of Mango Shrimp and Sesame Chicken, no spice.\n\nWhile waiting for our order I had a Tsing Tao and my son had a Dr. Pepper.\nOur bill for the two beverages, an appetizer and three entrees was $30 and some change.\n\nOur food was delicious, shrimp wasn't over cooked and plenty of mango and shrimp.  Red and green bell peppers, red and white onion, baby corn, zucchini, snow peas, carrots, lots of sweet mango and plenty of shrimp.  \nPot stickers were tasty, with or without the sauce.\nRice was warm and sticky - ideal for eating with chopsticks.\nHusbands Sesame Chicken was lightly battered, tossed with a semi sweet sauce similar to teriyaki and sesame seeds.  He said it was really good and couldn't eat it all.
1	"""First of all, this has nothing to do with Tapino's food or service. It may be great. In fact, that's what we were hoping.\n\nSecondly, we are big fans of what Chef Porter is trying to do. We have great respect for them advocating the locavore movement & using local farms & vendors. We're huge fans of local farmers markets & buy all our produce there. We're also huge fans of local independent restaurants & business and patronize them as much as possible.\n\nSo the birthday fail begins...\n\nOne more thing. Birthdays in my family are a big deal. Food is a big deal. We all grew up working in my dad's restaurant (the Glass Door) & food is hugely important to us. For birthdays, we do a fancy dinner & a family dinner. This was a family dinner. Lots of thought goes into choosing the place for each occasion. This was also my wife's birthday. Kind of a big deal for me. \n\nFor family dinner, we all go so we need a place that isn't too hard on the budget & that suits different dietary needs (some vegetarians, some food allergies). Looked at a ton of places & figured that we should try Tapino as they had a great food/drink special & we were into what they are doing. Figured it would be a gateway meal to us coming back a great deal more. \n\nOk, very last thing, kids... So we brought our kids. We've brought our kids out to eat since they were born & they know & appreciate good food. They've been places like Sea Saw, Nobu, Bouchon, etc. They know how to behave & are always expected to behave.\n\nSo to the story...\n\nCalled Tapino yesterday & spoke to the manager & asked if they could take a party of 12 for happy hour. She said they normally don't take reservations for happy hour but would be ready for us. Asked if they had 2 high chairs for the kids. She said no but they had low chairs & low tables on the patio that would work great. So we're in good shape, right?\n\nWell today, I walk in myself (without kids) & say that we are here for the party of 12 w/kids. The hostess said no kids allowed in bar nor on patio (as they allow smoking on the patio) & they don't serve happy hour in the restaurant & just lets it sit at that. Pretty weird. Was almost as if they'd were ready for us. \n\nOk, so if you don't want kids in your place...at least tell us. I dragged 12 people out & set their expectations & was excited to have the perfect place to celebrate my wife's birthday. Then we get there & you say sorry, nope?\n\nAlso, there wasn't a single person in the restaurant at this time. It was about 5:45. Not one.\n\nI'm like in shock so I tell her I spoke with someone yesterday & she understood our situation & that we were coming in. She said that she was right there when I spoke with her manager & they don't allow kids in the bar or on the patio & they don't do happy hour in the resturant. Ok, I get it. Probably heard this 7 times when I was there.\n\nMight as well have said go away, leave, we don't want you here.\n\nShe eventually said that the manager was there & she'd have her come talk with me.\n\nDuring the wait, I asked about last night's locavore dinner & told her we were excited to be there as we'd been following them on Chowhound & the Phoenix Hound Gathering group. Also told her I'd been talking with one of the farmers that was in for the previous night's event. Basically I let her know we know what they did & were into it. Might have factored in a bit? Nope.\n\nEventually, the manager came out & they chatted.\n\nThe manager then came over & changed the story & said we could sit in the bar at a couple of benches but kept reiterating that the kids couldn't make any noise nor move around at all. Ok, fine. First of all, we expect the kids to behave. If she'd left it with one mention, maybe we'd have just sat down. But with repeated mentions of no noise, no moving around, it was obvious they didn't want us there. I told her I felt that way & she said that wasn't the case but it rang quite hollow.\n\nI went outside to talk with the family & figured we'd probably go elsewhere as we really weren't wanted. Went in to tell the hostess (manager was nowhere around) & got a perfunctory sorry.\n\nJust seems like such a customer service failure. If they'd wanted us there, they could have refrained from making us feel unwelcome. Or if they were uncomfortable with kids being in the bar or on the patio, they could have easily set us up in the empty restaurant & offered us the same food/drink.\n\nOr they could have told us their mantra \no kids in the bar or on the patio, no happy hour in the restaurant\"""" on the phone. \n\nMaybe it was a bad situation for them but if it were me, I would have tried a little bit harder to find a solution that wouldn't have so alienated us.\n\nI don't know. I'm epxecting to see Chef Porter at OTFM & am friends with people who work with him & maybe we'll come back (sans kids of course) but right now it sure doesn't feel like it & it's a major bummer as Tapino seems like a place that is doing excactly what we love & we could have been huge fans."""""""
3	I am a fro-yo junky, so I was excited to enjoy some FROZEN yogurt on a nice chilly evening.\n\nI was excited to see what flavors they had for me to drool over, but was highly disappointed.  Their apple pie flavor tasted more like pumpkin pie, egg nog was way too sweet, chocolate wasn't chocolatey at all...so I opted for the plain tart.  \n\nThankfully they had some mango boba and lychee so I was able to satiate that craving.  \n\nWe were going to sit inside, but the tables were pretty dirty so we opted to sit outside under some of those portable heaters.\n\nThe yogurt is good, they have a decent variety of toppings, but I suggest some more variety of flavors...that is all.
4	I'm from MN but recently visited KY& this by far is super cool. Lots of everything you could hope for& stuff you have no need for! I purchased a purse &2 Arizona tanktops! Plus a smoothie on the way out. 4* because I couldn't find my way out. I will be back with my hubby to buy some wall decor plus let him shop! This was a reference from a friend in KY- I'm glad I listened & took the time to shop;)
3	My friend took me to this Korean BBW a week ago on a Sunday. It is located in a strip mall across from ASU - West. Upon entering the first thing i noticed was the furniture made of trees. It's really different and fun!\nI cannot remember what we ordered but first we were served 6 or so small white bowls with cold vegetables. I was not impressed, although the cold potatoes weren't vomitous.\nThen came the sizzling strips of beef and THAT was delicious, some of the best tasting strips of beef I've ever devoured.\n\nI would say if you like Korean food, you would enjoy this place. I am not a fan of Korean food but I would eat those strips of beef anyday.
4	Honestly, what's not to LOVE!!\n\nOrdered two dozen cupcakes for a bridal shower last weekend.  Quick and easy online ordering and payment in advance made for an easy breezy day-of pick up.\n\nMixed and matched 4 different flavors and they were all delicious.  Cake was moist and yummy, and frosting was thick, rich, and utterly decadent.\n\nThrow them on a tier display and they make for a great presentation.  Only 4 stars because they are a little pricey and that's no fun.  BUT....they were completely worth it.
5	AMAZING steaks. Aged and cooked perfectly. It's not too often we can splurge on meals like this, but we were so glad we did. Our anniversary is coming up in April and we will be going to Fleming's for sure. My husband loves their bleu cheese steak and the filet is fantastic. It's so hard to decide on side dishes, but you can't go wrong with any of them. \n\nI was also very impressed with their service and the ambiance is perfect for a romantic meal.
5	I'll get the drama out of the way now and say, unequivocally, I love, love, love this restaurant.  My wife and I are vegetarian, and it's not only veg-friendly, it's excellent.  Their veggie burger is one of the best I've had in the city, and Dr. Funk may be my favorite drink of all time, with the Scorpion Bowl coming in a close second.  Spicy tofu tacos?  Excellent.  My favorite dish is, by far, the Jungle Tofu bowl, which should always leave me with a to-go box, but is always consumed fully on the premises.  I almost never get dessert anywhere, but their key lime pie is the best I've had since Key West...no kidding.\n\nParking can be a bit of a bear on the wrong night here, but my favorite time to visit is on a Saturday afternoon when it's almost always quiet and relaxing.  We have an electric car, and their two charging stations are a plus, but at night they are almost always occupied by gas burners.  \n\nAnd before I forget, the staff here has always been lovely, from the hosts, to the bar and wait staff.  \n\nAs a last word, Hula is my go-to place when I need to relax and forget about my troubles.  They really make me feel like I'm on a tropical island.
5	LOVE Tottie's! Who knew such a swanky, wallet friendly place could be in a location like this? \n\nWhen we walked in, I was overtaken with the decor. But then we sat down and I was overtaken with it's extensive menu--they not only have sushi but Japanese, Thai and Vietnamese. They have a lot of different sushi rolls and also gives you a description of each one (One of them things most sushi places do which drives me batty!) Service was on point and quick to take our order and get anything we needed. I got the Flaming Tuna Roll and Broadway Roll and both were fresh and full of flavor. I love spicy stuff and the Broadway is not for the faint of heart--be sure to have some water nearby if you're going to try this one.\n\nThe only thing I disliked about Tottie's is that I live on the other side of the country and can't go back there any time I want, sadface.
4	"""This place is the \happening\"""" spot in their downtown location.  I will let you into a secret why.... $20 Bottle of Wine and bruschetta Monday and Tuesday, Starts at 8PM.  Expect waits if you want to save extra bucks.  The place is really nice, great ambience and the food is very good.  I recommend if you want to take advantage of the special that you come on Mondays, for some reason Tuesdays are busier... One big annoyance is the valet parking, they enforce it here but it is free. If you can ride your cruiser here, do it they have several posts."""""""
4	Sadly enough, Rosie McCaffrey's is like my Cheers --- not because it's so great, but because I can walk there, they know what my drink is, I can get schnookered and follow the breadcrumbs back to my house.  Come to think of it though, there are people there who resemble Norm, Sam and Woody.\n\nThe crowd is all over the map depending on the day of week.  A friend of mine sardonically describes it as a straight version of Padlock --which if you know what that means then great.  But if not, it's better that way -- trust me.  Let's just say it can be a bit of a meet market. \n\nWeekends are crowded and tend to attract a fun upper-20s, early-30s party-hearty crowd -- the Tempe crowd 7 years later, I suppose.  It attracts more of a mainstream crowd than say George and Dragon. \n\nBands perform on the weekends.  But to be honest I can't even tell you what kind of music or what they sing.  They have a lot of beers on tap (Harp, Guinness and such) and strong liquor pours.  Tom is a rockin bartender. Weekdays are more laidback with a steady happy hour clientele of alcoholics, business crowd, Central Phoenix locals, Irish expatriates and rugby people. The jukebox is OK, but there are better jukeboxes in the area.\n\nThe feel inside is your standard Irish chotchky clutter, but it feels like an actual old house with the whole upper level.  \n\nOh yes, and the pub grub is pretty good.  The fish and chips here are deserving of their reputation.  Great batter. The hot wings are also a good choice -- lots of meat and tasty Harp-soaked sauce. Stay away from the club sandwich -- the bread is soggy and the American cheese kind of ruins it. \n\nBTW, St. Patty's day is CRAZY here. Yeah there are Irish pubs everywhere, but this is the only Irish pub for miles around -- so the crowd here was huge and spilled into the parking lot.
2	Food ranges from delicious (elegant and lovely beef carpaccio) to mediocre (bland chicken rollatini and what might as well have been frozen vegetables).  The servers are lovely and attentive, and sort of distract you from the distinctly geriatric feel in the place.  My husband and I felt like the youngest people in the restaurant by at least 40 years.  I have no idea where this best ravioli nomination came from - they are abysmally forgettable.  I am hard-pressed to believe that a better ravioli cannot be found in Phoenix - there are just way too many good culinary adventures in the area to consider these bland, oversauced pillows of flavorless ricotta worth ordering.  \n\nUnimpressed by everything, we were bowled over by the bill.  How could a meal so forgettable come out to $150 for the two of us?  Was the wine that expensive? No.  Did we order anything extraordinary? No. Are we going back? You already know the answer...
5	I've only been to the yardhouse when I lived in Hawaii and I have to say this one is pretty amazing too! \nOne of my girlfriends was having her birthday and she wanted to go to a coyote game, however, we started the night at Yardhouse. I have to say this, their Mac N Cheese was BOMB! I don't think I've ever tasted anything that good in awhile. I am definitely going back for it. And the mixed drinks were hella good too. \nBTW, the vegetarian menu is to die for. You wouldn't even know half the stuff was vegetarian.
4	Tonight must be a good night! 3rd review.  I've had too much time to eat. :(\nThai Basil.  An addiction I've gained from my last college dorm room mate.  It makes me sick as hell to eat it, but the yellow curry is AMAZING.  I don't even want Tofu in it, cause it ruins the coconut goodness.  Aside from the flaming hot veggies, it's pretty good on top of the jasmine rice.  The great part is, they give you more than enough to take home...and it's not bad cold either.  Asian food is never bad cold the next day *grins* The ice coffee and thai tea looks awesome...little too spicy for me. of course they choose to open one right next to my old dorm AFTER I leave. Typical Thai Basil...Typical. Try it out, it's yummy! Great for veggies and Vegans...even you poser vegans...you know who you are. Night!
3	I'm bummed out that they closed Downside Risk for this, but the decor is pretty nice I guess... kinda dark and swanky. There weren't very many people there when I went, but it's partially the location. It's more off the beaten path than Dirty Pretty, but similar I guess.\n\nThe music is a strange mix of classic rock and new crap. \nThe drinks were stiff. \nThe service was good. \n\nWhen my father was still alive but dying of cancer, we used to go to Downside Risk to eat and drink. It was one of the few good memories I had of him. They had the most fantastic beer battered chicken fingers ever... it also felt larger than it does now. It's a new generation though - Downside Risk and Famous Door (now Lyte Lounge) were me and my older sister's generation.\n\nI can't say I'm a huge fan, but I'll give it another chance. Maybe it'll grow on me, but as a general rule I don't like places that have a door guy in a suit with a velvet rope out front. Plus, I tend to not end up at places where people are wearing Affliction shirts (and I saw one or two here).
2	We went to Province for a late lunch on a Friday. The restaurant was completely empty so you would think the food/drinks would come out quickly...unfortunately, that wasn't the case. We ordered the goat cheese fondue app - it was descent. Not overly flavorful. We both ordered a burger - it was delicious, but they only have a few topping options to choose from. Bacon is an option- it was really thick. Too much for this burger! \n\nThe server was really nice but got both of our orders wrong. My friend wanted to sub asparagus for the fries- she got fries and no asparagus. We waited 15 minutes or so for the asparagus and when it came out, it was lukewarm. \n\nProbably won't ever be back, but it was worth a shot.
4	"""Lest  it be said that I write only disparaging reviews,  let me avow my deep admiration (love is too strong a superlative in this instance,)  for America's Taco Shop.  The home-cooked beans (runny -style) are quite palatable.  The bean buritto is a safe choice for the distaff members  of our species (provided, of course, such can politely control bowel turbulence).  And please opt for the street-vendor style corn on the cob.  There is nothing like a mayo-covered, cojita sprinkled , piece of mid-western genetically altered  superbness.  For those carrying higher levels of testastrone, opt for the Pastor (pig stuck-on-a-vertical spit) or Carne Asada (very loosely translated: \meat\"""" burritto:\""""   You better order six,  they are very small.   Wash it all down with a make-believe Corona (I can't believe you shot me with a fresh lime squirt just because I happened to be glancing in the general direction of that woman's glutes) because the liquor license here is in a perpetual state of \""""in-process.\""""  Enjoy."""""""
3	"""Dont drink the martinis.  Ick.  Two for one?  I couldnt even get through my first.  Way too sweet and where is this booze you speak of?  And yes, Kristin, sticky hands!!!  Gross.  \n\nActually my thoughts on Devils North are very similar to Kristin's...  I cant figure out why/if I like this place.  It really does have a ton of potential and some really great bathrooms and you know how that scores big points with me.  But the music is way off (we definitely thought \wedding music\"""" at some points last night) and the crowd doesnt hold a candle to the Old Town location's clientele.  Older, worse dancers, and 30 somethings trying to relive their 20s.  Annoying.  \n\nWhy is everyone so damn drunk (and thus, yes, humping each others legs...I saw that too, WTF)??  Thursday happy hour.  Look past the faux fancy martini menu and go for whatever usually floats your boat.  EVERYTHING is 2 for 1 all night long.  \n\nThe food is actually pretty good too if you need some sustanance...they have some ridiculous deal for happy hour like you can pick 3 tapas/salads for $12 or something.  Go ahead and eat, or after your third double Goose and soda you might be the one humping legs on the dance floor.  \n\nGood layout of the bar, dont have to wait too long for drinks, clean bathrooms with attendant, usually free bottled water on the way out.  No cover before 10pm...$10 for guys after 10pm."""""""
4	I went there with family on Friday night at 5:30 with a reservation.  We were seated promptly.\n\nThe tortilla chips were good and were accompanied by three different salsas--one mild one in a larger bowl and two fiery ones in smaller bowls.  The hot ones had good, complex flavor to go with the heat.\n\nThe Maria Maria margarita was flavorful & refreshing.  I ordered carnitas, which were very good, but not quite as fall-apart tender as they should be.  The accompanying black beans were richly seasoned; the rice was good.  Portions were abundant--I had enough to fill myself up for two meals.\n\nMy brother-in-law had fish tacos that were OK, but lacking in salt or other seasonings.  Others in our party had enchiladas that they were pleased with.\n\nService was very good, especially for the restaurant only having opened so recently.  My two-year-old niece spilled her water and the waiter was quick to respond.\n\nThe restaurant is cool and cavernous.  There's a great selection of tequilas.  The guitar player/singer is very good.  Great place for groups or families.  Nick says check it out!
5	Thank you BILL!\n\nIf you own a Vanagon in Phoenix do not go anywhere else.  Bill will walk you through the basics, advise you on your next steps and even let you know how you can do things yourself.  He has the solid knowledge and track records on Subaru conversions as well.  \n\nThey also have a nice surplus of parts and he will do whatever he can to get you the best quality used or new parts for your van.  \n\nSince Gwynne S. pretty much covered all the based in extensive and accurate review, I will leave it that!\n\nThis is the DUDE!
3	I like this place. The food is not that great though. I kind of feel like it's pre-made and then heated up for each person. \n\nWhat I like: \n\nNice fancy atmosphere \nComfortable chairs \nHelpful service \nPlenty of Staff \nYou can drink in the movie \n\nWhat I don't like.. \n\nThe food.. Don't order the quesadilla, mac and cheese or chicken tenders... \n\nThe burger is OK... \n\nI love going to this theater and I will keep going, but I don't know if I will order food again, unless I'm starving. The theater would be exceptional if the food was more tasty. I also feel like movies are better when  you go there because you don't have to worry about anything. There is plenty of space in your big comfy chair, the wait staff is at the push of a button and you can always get a good seat. They even ran back to get kid sized 3D glasses. \n\nI have seen 3 movies here so far and am making plans for girl's night to see more in the future, but like I said, I will most likely only order popcorn and maybe dessert to eat.
5	The Arrogant Butcher is a great place to visit as long as there is nothing else going on in the area.   The night before my visit was an 1 1/2 hour wait.   Tonight I got in with no problem and the service was excellent.  \n\nFor an appetizer I had the Pretzel Fondue which was excellent.  My only complaint was that I had only eaten two bites and my entree was at the table.  It worked out well though because the bites needed to cool down so they became dessert.   \n\nI had the meatloaf special which sounds weird at a place like this, but it was excellent.   The meat loaf tasted great and the green beans were steamed just right with a little bit of seasoning.  \n\nI recommend that if you do go here that you save room for dessert.  I missed out on a few things that sounded great.
5	This place rocks for breakfast!!  I no longer live in Scottsdale and I miss the gingerbread pancakes- they are soooo good.  I am NOT a sweet breakfast-orderer either, so if I  miss pancakes then it means they are truly amazing.  I can honestly say this is the only place I've been to that I would ever order a type of pancakes for breakfast.  They're so good that putting anything on them (syrup or butter) just takes away from the amazing-ness of them.\nTheir omelets are always fantastic, too.  My favorite here is the delicious caprese omelet and I've also had the veggie omelet which is fabulous.  Their breakfast menu is sooo great I wish I could go back and order everything.  Also, they serve breakfast all day!  Awesome bloody mary's, too.  \nLove it!!!
4	"""After finding this on the Yelp \just reviewed\"""" section, I decided to give The Strand a try. We went on a Thursday night, and met some friends, who have 2 small children.\nIt was fairly empty, and far more casual than I had imagined. That's not a bad thing by the way.\nCute decor!!! I had the chicken parm with penne pasta which was good..my husband had the chicken parm pizza, which he also enjoyed.\nOur friend sent back the chicken for her dish..she felt it was slightly pink...and they fixed the issue asap.\nNice service and dessert was pretty good too. We had the cookie with ice cream combo. I'm sure on game nights this spot will be jumping.\nOH, and they validate parking for the garage..very handy."""""""
5	We love Angel Sweet. Here's why:\n\n1. There's always plenty of parking.\n2. The kids working there are nice.\n3. They have the BEST PEANUT BUTTER GELATO I have ever eaten. \n4. They don't limit you to the number of flavors you can get in a size, like some other places do.\n\nSo go ahead, try that super dark with the peanut butter and the cheesecake and fall in love with Angel Sweet. Just be prepared to sit on the hard bench outside or take it to go--they have only three or four tables inside.
4	Sometimes I work in the area and this is really convenient. There are not many fast food places along Carefree Highway, and this Wendy's is new and clean. \nI've gone inside and through the drivethru, and my order has been made quick and fresh each time. The restroom was clean, which is always a big plus.\n\nWendy's in general seems to be keeping up with the times, having better menu choices both health wise and price wise. I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here, but I have had no reason to seek a quick bite to eat elsewhere.
4	"""In NYC, I would probably drop this down to three stars, but for tiny Cave Creek, Arizona, outside of Scottsdale, I think four stars is warranted.  \n\nWe headed out to AZ for a mini-honeymoon and a conference Peter was attending.  Peter did his meticulous research and for my birthday dinner took me to a Douglas Rodriguez restaurant called Deseo.  We asked the manager for some more recommendations for dining in the area, and it turned out that he had worked with Binkley's, and sent us there.\n\nOff the radar, and a half hour along cactusy single lane highways outside of Scottsdale, it is a place we never would have found without a local's help.  Daily menus change with the seasons, the ingredients, and the mood of the chef, Kevin Binkley, who is young enough to be intrepid and old enough (five years at the French Laundry directly under Keller and then several years at the Inn at Little Washington with Patrick) to understand fine dining.  Binkley takes the fine dining concept out for a spin and brings it home via the back roads, and the result is a comfortable, homey, small restaurant that can be dressed up or down.  People sat at the bar and had beers, and people came in their Sunday best to celebrate anniversaries.  \n\nThe menu can be arranged in several ways, served a la carte, in full portions, or arranged in tasting menus of various combinations, paired with wines, and smaller in size.  We opted for the five course tasting menu with the cheeses in lieu of dessert ($82), and I ordered a half-bottle of Minor Viognier ($29) from their well-chosen, well-priced wine list, since Peter doesn't drink wine.  On the menu, it states that the chef can and will accomodate dietary requests, which knocked us both off our feet....low carb, vegetarian or whatever, you're in good hands, and the chef actually welcomes your challenge!\n\nSent home with the menu (tied in a blue satin ribbon), I can tell you what we chose, among three or four options per course:\n\nPeter's choices:\nBigeye Tuna Tartare with watermelon, edamame,l daikon, wasabi-coconut pana cotta, lotus root chips, lychee and chili oil\n\nSoft shell crab with lime, fried green tomato, red onion marmalade, lemongrass ginger sauce\n\nKing Clip with wild asparagus, ramps, pattypan squash, roasted fingerling potatoes (we asked for those to be left off and they were), spring garlic and rouille\n\nRibeye steak with egg yolk ravioli, broccoli, maitake mushrooms, baby bulb onions and hollandaise\n\nMy choices:\n\nSteak carpaccio with an heirloom tomato tart, mozzarella cream, cucumber, balsamic vinegar, basil and charred red onion\n\nCorned beef TONGUE Reuben, with sauerkraut, thousand island \dressing\"""", a cornichon, and french fries\n\nCopper River King Salmon with giant gnocchi, sweet peppers, tasso ham, sea beans, orange and mustard\n\nThe same ribeye as Peter--we both had to have it.\n\nWe both had the cheeses at the end, and I can't remember all of them, but all six were outstanding.\n\nOthers have mentioned the plethora of amuses that come out prior to your courses, and while I did eventually find them a little distracting, most were very successful, with only the disco coaster presentation of a pineapple shooter failing to amuse my bouche or anything else.  Others include a house-cured beef jerky with horseradish creme fraiche, a bacon and egg puff pastry bite, a melon and basil soup shot with pancetta dust rimming the glass and a date and chorizo bite that was nothing short of heaven.  Most were savory and enjoyable.\n\nOur food was very good, with the only failure of my meal being the overabundance of orange with my salmon.  In sauces, in segments, all over, it distracted me from the other savory elements instead of complementing it, but the salmon was delicious.  I would go into more detail about the food, since what is listed above is, in THEORY, what we were served, but in actuality was not, since Binkley is an adherent to the molecular gastronomy/Wylie Dusfresne/Adria/Michel Richard style of cooking.  It defies description, so I won't.  You'll be happy if you go with an open mind.\n\nOn our visit, there were three breads to choose from as they bring it around.  We tried a sourdough ciabatta & a cracked wheat, both extraordinary, helped not a little by Normandy butter, served room temperature in a ramekin.\n\nService is from the left, French style, one waiter per person, with knowlegeable servers directing traffic and helping as needed in the small space.  We were made to feel welcome and at home from the  moment we entered for our 8:15 reservation.  Young people learning the fine dining business are the norm here, servicewise, with three steady young women in black overseeing them and taking orders and discussing the wines with the diners as they are seated.  I had no problem with the youth and inexperience of the servers but Peter found it a little offputting.   Don't expect perfect French from these youngsters and you'll be satisfied, is my opinion."""""""
1	"""Won't be going back.  I am always looking for a good Mexican place-- on a specific search for the best guac in greater Phoenix--, and one of my coworkers thought we should give it a try.  The one good thing is the decor inside- it really is nice.\n\nNow on to the \no bueno\"""" portion of our program... In summary, the food was bland, the food was cold, the service wasn't that great, and the salsa and the guacamole were just plain WEIRD.  No need to overexplain bland and boring food (I had a chicken burrito, and I added cheese, rice, and sour cream), but I do want to point out that I ate GRISTLE in my chicken... which is what finally made me stop trying.  Other items to note:\n\n1.  The server would barely glance at us, and when she came to ask for our order, she hadn't even asked for a drink order first.  Also, we had to ask twice for more tortilla chips.  I will say, though, that our main dishes came out fast... but mine was ice cold.\n\n2.  The flavor of the salsa was okay, but the texture was-- as another Yelper has described-- exactly like ketchup.  Bizarre.\n\n3.  The guac.  Oh the guac.  Horrific.  The first question was the pale green color.  My friend and I spent at least 4 full minutes trying to figure out what one would mix with avocados to get that exact Lawrence Welk-era seafoam color.  There was no onion, no peppers, no lime, NO flavor.  After a few additional samplings (more out of morbid curiosity than anything), I came up with EGG.  Yes, like hard-boiled egg whites.  Color and texture.  Bweck.\n\nTo my food-loving compatriots out there:  don't do it.  Not worth your time or money."""""""
4	whenever I go to Wal-mart this is usually my first choice although it is 4 miles from my house, however that could soon change considering they are converting this store into a super-center. the service is alright here, never had any problems.\nI have been coming to this location with my family for many years, I was also in a fox special report they did here in 1999 (youtube it!) its great their is also a built-in Subway even though I still go to the one at the end of the lot by Dunkin' Donuts. since they have started remodeling it has been confusing to locate specific items in the store but I'm sure they will get it sorted out once they finish. other than that, no major complaints like some of the other stereotypical Wal-marts in Phx.
3	"""Love - Hate\n\nI have a hard time reconciling my emotions when it comes to IKEA. It seems to me all the products they carry that I really love are priced just as high as any other modern high-quality furniture  store like Bova (Tempe) or Copenhagen. \n\nI understand this is a college kids wet dream, but for quality furnishings I think you can do better with the same amount of money elsewhere.\n\nMost times I have visited I start to get stressed about halfway through the \maze\"""" and really start to freak out; only to be consoled by 50-cent hotdogs...\n\nBEWARE: Any store powerful enough to have a public road named after it."""""""
4	Perhaps this is just the cutest place ever? I love the cupcakes here.  Why they're so good, I'll never know but I am addicted.  I had a coconut one that was just amazing. And a chocolately one that I can't think about without getting a tear in my eye. Really.  They're that good.\n\nThe sandwiches are great.  The coffee drinks are good.  It's just a really cool lunch spot to hang out with friends or to people watch alone.  I like to bring a book and hang out for a bit or grab the old computer and get a drink and do a little work.\nSuch a great place!
5	Lovely ambiance in this Arcadia shopping strip. They did away with the traditional storefront and installed a beautiful accordion door that really opens the space up. This creates a lovely atmosphere for the patrons and as well the workers! Workers are super friendly and always have a smile on their face. Great coffee and pastries. This is a great neighborhood coffee house if you live in the Arcadia area, or work near by. I recommend the French Press  with the Vanilla Cinnamon Twist bean!  Will come here often!
4	"""Have to give this place 3-4 stars for food but 5 stars for service. Great service so I've gotta average it out.\nBasic chain restaurant food. My shrimp tacos weren't so great. Didn't care for the crispy, dry flour tortilla. I prefer the corn.  Not much shrimp in tacos. Sauces were okay.  The seared ahi salad looked pretty good. Tasted the pulled pork sandwich and I really liked the savory sauce...not too sweet. Pizza was okay. A bit greasy but edible. I prefer thin crust.\nService was amazing.  Someone in my party ordered a mojito and her glass came to the table sticky. She told the waitress. Waitress offered to get her a new glass but she said she was okay and wrapped a napkin around it and was fine.  Even though she was fine w/ the glass, the manager came over and offered to replace the drink and she did.  Excellent customer service as the waitress did not just \sit on it.\"""" She took the minor complaint to management and they took a minor complaint seriously and did something/anything about it to please the customer. Top, top service. Had to bump up to 4 stars."""""""
5	Really nice place.\n\nMy sister-in-law comes here for her timeshare and she let us use it for our trip to Phoenix this last Summer.  Our suite was quite big--essentially a one bedroom apartment.  There was a big bathroom there, sauna, swimming pool and hot tub outside, barbecues, wireless internet and a comfy bed.  It's a little far away from Phoenix proper, but being close to the freeway is a plus.\n\nIf you got the bucks to pay for this, then by all means splurge.  I thought it was a great spot to stay at.
5	Love the urban feel contrasted with the French cuisine and pastries.  I usually get the foie gras sandwich (comes with a salad & amazing vinagrette) which leaves just enough room for...dessert!  \n\nI've tried quite a few pastries and don't have anything bad to say about any of them.  I do prefer the milk chocolate tart to the dark even though I'm usually a dark chocolate person.  So that's a darn good tart.  Dessert cups tend to be VERY sweet.\n\nGreat friendly atmosphere and definitely interesting to see an Asian guy with a French accent.
3	Have I ever shared my issues with microwaves before? I know I am a creep but I really dislike microwaved food. I almost had a meltdown when my expensive green chile burro was placed in the microwave. \n\nIt was $11 and it's not even fresh? Is it cold? I watched you scoop it onto the tortilla, it wasn't from the fridge and if it wasn't hot to serve......does that mean it was at the perfect temperature for food born bacteria?  \n\nAlso, don't you know microwaves make tortillas all funky and weird textured? \n\nWhile it was microwaving I was able to check out the dried, crusty filth on all of the appliances: evidence of cooking and not cleaning. Yuck.  I really need to stop looking at stuff like that. \n\nLuckily, I was able to talk myself out of being a total nut job and I ate it. I was only able to eat  some of it because 1. it was effing huge and 2. the image of the crusty splatter kept popping into my head. regardless, It was so tasty. \n\nMy favorite green chile burro used  to be from Espos but I have other issues with Espos.  This burro compares and while not totally clean and it being overpriced... and the fact that they microwaved it....it was really really really good. \nlike good enough for me to give this place 3 stars. \n\nI like my green chile burros made with shredded beef, none of that weird cubed meat for me,  and they deliver on that aspect!\n\ni honestly don't know if i'm capable of going again, but if you're more hardcore than i am and you are down with the get down, the i say munch up!
5	Avid yogi - I plan to get buried in my Lu Lu garb!\n\nA little vain perhaps, but I love that I can coordinate a whole ensemble, and feel stylish, yet comfortable and practical whether it be in class, or out and about doing chores on a Sunday afternoon. Luon, their in-house fabric washes like a dream and fits like a second skin.  The whole brand culture is great - with class suggestions, teacher endorsements etc. \n\nWe all identify with brands... and I put this one right up there next to 'Apple' for its functional usability and desirability!\n\nNothing compares. Period.
4	"""I first went to the Mesa location but had to try the original one.  I was surprised to see that both places are very slim and long.  This location is very small.  How small you ask?  Small enough that the staff constantly has to stop what they are doing to step aside and let other coworkers pass.  They were good at it though.\n\nI love trying different types of food, and if it's a small local I am definitely in.  After checking out the rave reviews I gave them a shot.  I loved my pasty (Pass-tee) at both locations but I was denied the shepards pie one in Mesa because they were out.  I lucked out and finally got it at this location.  Boy was that good.  Ground lamb just has a better flavor note to it that beef doesn't bring to the table.\n\nWe also had a little half salad and some roasted potatoes.  Both were tasty and the roasted potatoes have a coat of fresh thyme on them and didn't have the fat and grease factor of fries.\n\nIn a place this small it is impossible to have bad service.  You can literally reach out and tap the staff if you feel neglected, that is how close they are.  Why do they get minus a star?  Because I am 6'5\ and had to assume a yoga pose that I am neither familiar with, nor comfortable performing due to the closeness of the stool to the bar.  I could have chosen a table, but I live to drink in the experience.  \n\nThey have several beers to choose from, bonus points for not having American piss water on tap and having a little variety.  The place is very casual with some personality too.  \n\nA little tip for those like me who broke the record for most U-turns within a 100 yards.  The place faces west on the NE side of the intersection between University and Hardy.  A little tricky at night because the sign may not be on and the little shopping center address isn't lit up either.  \n\nGreat food, friendly and social staff.  Unique little place.  What more do you want?"""""""
4	I've been to a several Valley resort spas and this one doesn't disappoint.  \n\nI guess rating and reviewing spas can be a bit tricky as not only treatments depend upon the staff but expectations and use of the facilities varies from person to person.  I'm a massage fan and love to use the steam, sauna, pool, and workout facilities.  Plush lounge areas and well-stocked shower and locker rooms are pluses.\n\nThe pool and pool area at this resort spa was the biggest that I've experienced.  Plenty of lounge chairs and a swimming area larger than average.  I also enjoyed 1 of the 2 outdoor showers.  Can't explain it but you'll know what i mean when you try it.  Made me want 2 get one for my home.\n\nBut i digress, the spa also has a decent cafe overlooking the pool area and the upstairs lounge area was very comfortable.  Need to go back soon!
3	Sure I like Thai do you like shirt? \n\nSwaddee Thai is another strong local Thai restaurant that could use slightly lower prices for lunch time. \n\nEvery time I was in for a visit I had the red curry tofu, The sauce was rich and spicy as expected, the vegetables were a bit sparse compared to other Thai places and the tofu was not as firm as I would have liked. It came in smallish round bowl.\n\nI did appreciate the fact that they did make my meal quite spicy when I asked for it.\n\nThis place is decent but there are better options in the neighborhood.
5	South Mountain is a great place for a nice hike within the Phoenix metro limits. Remember your location if you are disappointed by the fact that many hikes intersect with roads and that Phoenix is almost always in view. This is one thing Phoenix has done right. A 10-15 minute drive from my apartment and I can observe several types of cacti, and maybe even some desert creatures. There's usually a nice breeze blowing from the peaks, and looking out away from the city gives one gorgeous views of the southern metro farmlands and beyond. \n\nAlthough I like to take my time hiking, South Mountain gives you the opportunity for a full hike including transit there and back in about two-and-a-half hours. It's a really good introduction to the desert for anyone visiting town, and there are various types of trail suitable to both those in shape and those not so much.
5	Amazing, plain and simple.\n\nI don't quite have the experience that my girlfriend does when it comes to Pho (she grew up back east), but this place has the best Pho that I have tasted.  I took my girlfriend here to try it out because I saw the reviews here on yelp and I am glad that I did.  The food we had was amazing and we will definitely be going back for more.  \n\nIf you are in the mood for great Vietnamese food, Khai Hoan is the place to go.
5	Wondering where to go to dinner tonight, we followed our senses and the cyber sensations coming from the deli's e-mail blast of tonight's menu. We made the long drive to Queen Creek from NE Mesa (on a week night!) and were rewarded handsomely with the usual amazing fare. My wife had the Panko Crusted Pork Schnitzel w/ Lemon Butter Sauce and I had the Slow Roasted Chicken Breast w/ Romesco Sauce.  As usual, the meats were a cut well above and the sides (Pearl Couscous w/ Roasted Tomatoes in my case) were inventive and came in generous portions (too bad I'm on a low carb diet!).  Don't let the butcher paper tablecloths and casual attitude fool you. the deli serves serious food! Blake and his staff know how to please!  Make the drive one time and you'll end up investing in a hybrid so you can afford to come back again and again and again.
4	I love PF Changs. Well, let me rephrase that: I love PF Changs vegetarian options. When I ate meat, I wasn't the biggest fan of their food. But they have some delectable Ma Po Tofu and vegetable side dishes that tickle my fancy.\n\nHowever, while eating meat, I went there and was sorely disappointed. For vegetarians, however I highly recommend the joint! For meat-eaters, meh. There is much better pan Asian cuisine.\n\nOur waitress was funny and very attentive. We came here on a date and she recommended some amazing cocktails. The Coconut Lemon Sour was amazing. Not cloyingly sweet and hit the spot. I rarely crave cocktails, but this one is definitely craveable.\n\nRarely does a restaurant make yummy tofu, but they do here. In fact, I never order it at restaurants because 98% of them have boring, flavorless tofu. That is probably why people hate it. At PF Changs, you won't.
4	Saw too many great reviews for this place to pass it up.....although I drove by it because it is hard to notice right behind the Taco Bell, so for a second I did pass it up.  It is a tiny little itty bitty restaurant with about 8 or so tables inside.  Service wasn't the best either but that is what is expected at a place like this.  Thank god for the Yelp app because I took one look at the menu and I got dizzy with trying to figure out what I wanted.  I went with Arlin B's recommendation on the sampler tamales and even got a beef turnover.  I was the first one in the place and it only took about an hour to get out of there because they were still setting up (like I said dont go for the service) but the tamales were awesome!  The masa was very moist which is huge and they had plenty of stuffing in each.  The Ecuadorian tamale was different but still very good, the green was the best with large green chilies inside, and the red was fantastic as well.  I did not care of the turn over and the salsa was spicy but to much of a tomato taste to it.  Maybe that is authentic Ecuadorian and if that is the case those folks have terrible taste.  The overall experience was worth it and I would go again....probably take out.  Bring your patience..... or a book.
2	"""It's not \Asian\"""" food at all, it's (someone's) \""""Asian food concept\"""".\nI thought everything was either bland, or hot for the sake of being hot - no complexity in the flavors.\n\nMost ESPECIALLY if you're from the Northeast or California,  I think you will be sorely disappointed. \n(Now I must tell you here that I am a \""""traditionalist\"""" - being from NYC & Boston, and having family in San Francisco, that is the yardstick I go by.)\n\nAlso, their menu is written slightly cutesy - which I usually find annoying, and even MORE so in a Chinese restaurant.  \n\""""Chop-Chop Lunch Specials\""""? \n\nIt's definitely a chain-style restaurant - and we already have PF Chang's up the wazoo here in the Valley.\nI didn't have any problems with the service, but I've only been there on weeknights.

3	"""Over the years I've been a buyer, window shopper, seller and borrower at many pawn shops. I even worked at one for day. Pawn shops are great places to borrow money or score a good deal. They are one of the most easily accessible forms of credit around and are available to anyone who with a legal ID.\n\nPawnshops vary greatly from shop to shop depending on local, city and state rules. They also vary based on how the owner decides to run them. In my experience there are 3 types of pawn shops; the retail store type, the crackhead-we'll-loan-money-to-anyone-that-comes-in-this-joint type and a hybrid of the two. There are variations as well with the our-guys-tote-guns type and the unarmed type and the we-hire-people-that-know-stuff type and the we-hire-people-that-know-nothing type.\n\nThis shop seems to be a hybrid as far as knowledgable employees goes and as far as being unarmed goes in what seems to be a more friendly retail environment. While none of the people here have been downright rude to me a couple have acted condescending at times despite having zero knowledge about an item. Conversely, there are a couple of super friendly employees here.\n\n3 stars is \A-ok\"""" and I won't argue with that for this place. They'll work with you, they'll cut deals, they'll make good loans, they'll negotiate prices for items for sale. I recommend dealing with the guy that smokes cigars whose name I believe is Dave. Knowledge and friendliness seem to be his strong-suit and he certainly understands the idea of long-term customer relations.\n\nNot a big shop, but a clean shop and better than a lot of shops in town."""""""
3	i am a vegetarian with vegan tendencies and i stopped here without knowing anything about it at the whim of a couple mates either to or from the hark a while back. i had been craving a burger, and so the pita jungle was a very lucky find. the burger was a bit dry, but i would eat here again due to how vegetarian-friendly the menu is; if you are vegan, you can find out what is vegan from their site (or just look up 'pita jungle vegan' via your search engine of choice).the hummus lasted for a while after i took it home (a week or two?). their hummus is tr\u00e8s savoureux, and our waiter (?) was more than happy to give us a sampling of all three types- i recommend asking for extra pita.

1	Went for kennel cough vaccination for my dog 2 weeks back. Front desk lady told me it was $19 inclusive of the booster shot that was to be administered 2 weeks later (there are multiple other places that do it for less than $15, but I chose to go with them since they promised to cover the booster shot as well). I went in today for the booster shot. They said that it was time for his valley fever test as well (I didn't keep record of it since my wife was out of town and she was maintaining his records), so I asked them to go ahead with the test. After administering the shot and the valley fever test, the front desk said I needed to pay $19.9 further for the booster shot and they claimed that no one could have told me that the first $19 covered the booster as well and they wouldn't listen to me when I told them about the information I got 2 weeks back. Also, later I found out from my wife that my dog was not due for his valley fever test anytime soon ($78).. I was effectively fleeced $100 by this clinic today!
5	"""I was here for a business conference, Thursday-Saturday.  We arrived early (around 11am) and they were able to check us in without any hassle at all.  I think their normal check-in time is 4pm.  The service was great, very helpful in pointing out where everything was on the map.  This was a plus because the Arizona Biltmore has many separate buildings on their massive grounds.  \n\nThe lobby was nice and airy with lots of places to sit.  I also noticed a restaurant and a bar.  Walking outside, there are lounge chairs and cabanas for those who didn't mind the heat.  For being in the desert, the AB was definitely very green.  Lots of grass, palm trees and shrubbery to highlight the beautiful resort grounds.\n\nThe architecture here is also amazing.  Definitely look at the details in the stones, glass, walkways, doorways, and almost everywhere else.  It's quite entrancing.  \n\nWe took the short trek to our room (it was a trek because the weather was about 100 degrees and rising).  I opened the door to my room and was pleasantly surprised by the size.  It's larger than the usual hotel rooms but with all the nice amenities (flat screen, internet, king size bed with lots of thread count sheets, etc...).  Typical hotel room decor -- just lots of open space (enough for me to do a cartwheel).  The bathroom was equally nice and roomy as well.  They have a separate shower and bathtub.  There are 2 sinks and I liked the stone tiles on the ground.  The towels were very soft and the robe was a nice touch (even though it dwarf me with the sleeves hanging past my fingertips and the length practically dragging on the ground...).\n\nI was sad I didn't have much time to enjoy the \resort\"""" part of the hotel though.  Their golf course/putting greens was beautifully manicured (although I don't play golf); the pool areas were all very inviting and kept beckoning me to just jump in -- business suit and all.  And I probably would have, if not for the fact that I can't swim.  Darn.\n\nI did get to enjoy the food and bar though.  The food for the conference was surprisingly good.  We even had a petite filet mignon dish that was very nicely cooked and flavored.  The bar was nice -- but expensive.  Mixed drinks were about $12 - $14.\n\nRoom service was impeccable, the concierge was knowledgeable and courteous, and the conference went well.  I truly enjoyed my stay here -- sans the scorching temperature of course.   That I could have done without just fine."""""""
5	"""This place was great!  My husband and I don't go down to Tempe much, but we had plans to be there for something and decided to have dinner afterward at House of Tricks.  \n\nFirst, we were running late for our reservation, and they were very nice about it.  When we arrived, we decided to sit outside.  After deciding our table was both too close to a rather large group and in too warm a location, the hostess happily moved us somewhere quieter and more comfortable.  The ambiance is very nice, and it is a great place for a romantic date.\n\nWe ordered a couple of delicious drinks (the \Spring Chicken\""""), ate some of the very good bread, and started discussing the menu.  The manager (we later learned his name is Kirk) was busing a table and overheard us and asked if we had any questions.  This turned into the best luck of the night because Kirk, after asking a few important questions, was able to direct us to a couple of outstanding dishes. \n\nMost significantly, he strongly recommended trying the beef tenderloin \""""charred rare,\"""" which (from what I recall of his description) involves searing the steak on a very hot grill and baking it briefly so the whole thing is heated through.  The result is an amazingly tender, delicious steak with the consistency of a \""""toasted marshmallow\"""" (again, Kirk's word).  Neither my husband nor I like our steak bloody, but Kirk assured us that this would convert us, and he was right.  The steak was insanely good - very tender, quite rare, but not at all bloody.  We also tried an asparagus, spek, and poached egg salad on a brioche crouton, which was very nice, and a fried fromage with strawberry preserves and ciabatta that was good, but too rich and sweet to finish.  \n\nKirk came back later to make sure we'd enjoyed the food, and insisted on buying us dessert.  We were too full (and the cheese and strawberry preserves were a good dessert substitute), but he sent a slice of Pumpkin Cheesecake home with us (I still haven't had room to try it, but my husband said his bite was delicious).  \n\nWe were very impressed by the ambiance, the service, the food, and by Kirk, who clearly knows his stuff and believes in the food they serve.  We will certainly be making the trip down to Tempe again to eat here."""""""
5	Cheba Hut could be a 3.5-star review on a few of the times I've gone, but it's never been terrible by any means. My favorite is the Kush (BLT). Garlic is the best bun to get (again, in my opinion). I can't explain it, but everything seems even across the bread and toasted just right. This is one of the more unique dining options on the West side, and the fact that's it's great food is an added benefit.\n\n\nIt's typically faster to call in an order because the wait can be ridiculous at times. They also offer delivery which I have not tried yet.  I hope they open some more locations along the I-17 or even downtown and uptown. I really can't fathom going back to Subway with Cheba and Silvermine around.
3	Went here with a friend for dim sum.  Since leaving Nor. Cal. I've been craving dim sum, and after seeing all the yelp reviews, thought it was worth a try.\n\nIt was OK.  That's sort of the most I can say.  The selection was decent. We had shrimp noodles, which were well seasoned and had good texture, but the pork dumplings, steamed pork buns, and egg rolls were relatively bland. The sticky rice in banana leaf was just okay too - it had three different kinds of meat, all of which were seasoned differently. There were no vegetables available during the week, except if ordered from the menu.  I would have liked a better selection of dim sum choices.\n\nThat being said, the wait staff was very friendly and not pushy at all - though if you aren't good at saying no, I can see where you might end up with more dim sum than you can eat.  The prices were very reasonable.
1	"""Sorry Mark, I have to mostly disagree with you on this one. \n\nI do agree that they have great dogs, so maybe that's why they don't actually want to adopt them and I hate to be down on an organization who is trying to do a good thing, but...\n\nA couple a weeks ago, a friend who volunteers for the rescue had taken one of the dogs out of the kennel he is staying in and brought him to the Fat Tire Festival at Tempe Town Lake. I fell in love with the little guy, his name is Jalen, and called my fiance to see if he'd come meet him too. He did, he loved him, so we decided to see if we could adopt him. \n\nAfter filling out the online application (the only way to put in an application), which took over an hour, we waited the three business days they gave as the time frame that it could take to get back to us. Three days passed, nothing, so I called and emailed them to see if they even received the application, no response. So I asked my friend to find out next time he went to volunteer, if they had gotten it.  They told him that the website must be broken, because they did not receive it, so I asked him to see if they got the email or voicemail. NO? Okaaaay, what the hell? \n\nWell, my volunteer friend brought over Jalen to our house to meet our other dogs and cat, to see if he would even fit in here. They all got along just fine. Seriously, they all got along, even with the cat.\n\nRobert calls me later when he gets back to the rescue, and says, they found my application, but they still didn't call me back. So, we emailed them and called AGAIN. Finally, one and a half weeks after we filled out the online application,  a woman calls me with a list of excuses of why Jalen would not be a good fit. She told me that the cat is a concern, that the dog is terrified of cats (even though it says on his description on their website \We haven't found anyone Jalen doesn't get along with - cats, dogs, humans - he's just so mild-mannered.\""""), I told her he met my cat and they were indifferent to each-other, there were other excuses she had, it was like she was reading them off a list. Finally after being on the phone with her for a half an hour, and it was obvious she didn't want to actually adopt the dog to anyone, I told her I had to get back to work. She then calls back ten minutes later saying that if we were okay with potty-training Jalen (apparently all of the other excuses she gave me were going to be disregarded now), that a volunteer could come over on Saturday morning to asses the situation. We said absolutely, see you then! \n\nA senior volunteer (with the adopting powers)came over this morning, everyone got along great. Our pets are very loved and cared for. But she had a problem with us keeping our dogs outside, when it's nice out, like today, when we leave the house. We don't think they should be crated up when it's so nice out, our dogs like to be outside in our big backyard able to run around and lay in the grass/sun, not in a little crate inside. So she told us to keep the dogs inside when we leave the house for 30 days and see how that goes, and then call them back and they would come back over to reassess and she took Jalen back to the kennel where he has been staying, waiting for a good home. \n\nNeedless to say we were pretty disappointed that they didn't adopt to us, and completely disenchanted with the organization. We've adopted through a rescue before and didn't have any problems, I'd try valleydogs.org or www.akitaadvocates.com of you're looking for another rescue."""""""
5	"""Right across the street from my house is the new park and boy is it awesome!  I love everything about it.  The \Her Secret is Patience\"""" sculpture, the light pillars, the solar panels that offset the park's energy use, the hills, the chess/checker tables, and the rehab of one of my favorite buildings.  Everything about this park makes you want to go there.  In a few years, those trees will be full and cover almost 75% of the park.  Tons of shade, tons of grass, and tons of love for the new Civic Space Park."""""""
2	This resort has been and always will be a Phoenix institution. Constructed in 1929 by a former employee of Frank Lloyd Wright (his draftsman) Albert Chase Mcarthur, it is an architectural masterpiece.  Everything about the design is unique, and awe inspiring.\n\nWhat is not so inspiring is the condition in which the hotel sits in today. The place is literally falling apart at the seams. Be prepared when you visit for a lack of AC in common areas, rooms in a state of disrepair and need of remodel, and as of 10/17/08, a LOT of construction. The Villas on property are privately owned, which roughly translated means that it is the owners responsibility to keep them maintained, not the hotels. You don't know what you are going to get. \n\nThe 39 acres of grounds on this property are stunning. Kudos to the grounds crew as the grass, trees, and flowers are always perfect. 8 pools across the property are beautiful and with the exception of one, are open 24 hours a day. They also have 7 tennis courts and full size basketball court outdoors which is nice. \n\nWright's is a great dining room, and I give it my full endorsement, but their other options are uh, how do you say, crap? The Cafe is very overpriced and never open when it is supposed to be. Cabana Club is good, but has no indoor seating so it only works in the cooler months, and closes at about 4-6pm daily. The Biltmore Grill is closed for construction for the forseeable future. \n\nI'm just really mixed on the place, I want to like it so bad, but the fact of the matter is you can really tell there is no pride of ownership. Morgan Stanley owns the hotel, and what can I say? They are an investment firm who reads the profit margin on their statement every month and is long as it is a black number, they ignore the place. If you want to go somewhere that really cares about your business, this is probably the wrong place. If you are into architecture and history, check it out.
5	Kinda spicy, but not too spicy fried chicken. I saw this last time I was in Phoenix, and am glad I went this time. I also had the rice (I think it was dirty rice) and it was also a bit spicy but not too. I put the hot sauce on the bread for a while, but the spice of all the food started to catch up on me, so I stopped doing that. \n\nI had Coca Cola with a spritzer of Fanta Strawberry. Wow, that strawberry is pretty potent. It really had the taste. Will have to return and try some of the other things.
5	"""Any of you guys know of a good liquor sto.? I do. This is one of my old school drive through, even tho the drive up window is no more. When I was 19, I was a sommelier, in a way, working part time at a drive through, named Farmers Liquor. \n\nLets see, cigarettes were under a dollar easy. The winos, I mean Wine Connoisseurs loved tokay, ripple, brass monkey and the young gals loved strawberry hill. I guess I would have loved to have taught these people the wine 'lingo' and how to look like a pro when tasting Gallo Wines, like how to crack open the cap properly while in a brown paper bag. How to swirl the wine in the bottle to increase the surface area exposure to the air, to help it evolve. How to take a mouthful of wine and swirl it around your mouth.\n\nAnyway for these guys, it all started in the 1950s, well before my time when Red 'Pops\ Wilkinson opened a small corner liquor store where one could buy a six-pack of beer, renew a fishing license or pick up a Styrofoam cooler. A lover of all things outdoors, Red named his establishment Sportsman's Liquors.\n\nYou've come a long way Mr. Sportsman."""""""
4	Sacks has a great sandwich. Shocking right? But they do and I'll tell you why I like to visit. During the week, often times I am running from meeting to meeting and when lunchtime hits and I'm hungry, I just want to get in and out with a good sandwich in hand. At Sacks, I can do this. It reminds me of another sandwich shop I've been to in another city and I was incredibly happy when I realized the similarities.\n\nI enjoy every sandwich I order at Sacks, especially ones that have cream cheese on them. The sandwiches are the perfect lunch size and not overwhelmingly large that leads to a food coma. A sacks sandwich also comes with a cookie which is an added bonus. The pricing is decent and I can enjoy a nice meal at an economic price in a quick manner. Does it get much better for lunch on the go?\n\nSo in summary of my short and sweet and to the point review, my suggestion is that next time you are on the go and looking for a good place to find a sandwich quickly, check out Sacks.
4	"""I went to Rustler's Roost last night with some out of town guests.  The atmosphere and the rustic look to the place was definitely a plus and the views were amazing... I see why so many past reviewers said the sunset was to die for!\n\nWe started off in the saloon for happy hour.  Discounted prices on their appetizers ($3 each) and a brewsky.  They serve all the adult beverages in mason jars which added a nice flair to the place.  The zucchini logs were to die for...  I was looking forward to dinner!\n\nI ordered the top sirloin that was \prime\"""" that they had highlighted on the menu.  It came with homemade rolls/biscuits, family style salad for the table to share, green beans, beans (tasty!) and corn on the cob.  The steak was cooked perfectly (rare) but I didn't feel that it had too much flavor.  Don't get me wrong -- I still ate almost all of it!  \n\nMy favorite part of the evening had to be the magician that came by our table.  He really was entertaining and had me mind boggled  in the 5 minutes he was at our table \""""tricking\"""" us.  \n\nDefinitely will be visiting the Rooste again!"""""""
2	I was hankering for a good fish dish a la Vera Cruz and decided to try out Mimita's Cuban Cafe since a friend had recommended it. It's sad to say that I was very disappointed with their food. I ordered the Filete de Pescado al Ajo with Moros. Needless to say, aside from the butt load of crushed garlic enough to scare off the vampires on Halloween, the food was bland underneath all that garlic. The only thing that was enjoyable was the Maduros. But it's pretty tough to mess up fried plantain.\n\nI don't see me going back there, nor recommending it to my friends and family...and they call themselves The Best Cuban Food in Town, yuck!
5	I am absolutely obsessed with this place.  Every single thing about it is perfect.  The food.  The drinks.  The service.  The quaintness of the building.  I couldn't possibly explain in words how great I think this place is, but I will surely try.  \n\nThe first time I ever went here was on New Year's Day and my friends and I still had on our Happy New Years dresses, heels, makeup, the whole 9-yards AND to top it off...we were sporting the hats that boasted HAPPY NEW YEAR all sparkly and obnoxious on it that we had somehow acquired the night before.  We were, needless to say, a bit hungover and ready for some delicious food after an incredible night.  The owners happened to be working that day and immediately jumped on board with us and joined us in shouting happy new year and then proceeded to explain the menu and take their time with us since we were clearly in no state to comprehend much of anything.  Needless to say, I fell in love with not only the owners but also the California Club (which we order on a croissant and add a hashbrown patty to).  This sandwich is like heaven, but better because it exists and is edible.  Seriously, if you're reading this, just stop and head over there for a California Club right now.  It'll be the best thing you have ever done with your life.\n\nEver since that day, I make special trips to this place (considering I live nearly an hour from it) and have never once been disappointed with the service or anything else.  This place can do no wrong and I just hope more people get the chance to try it because this is one place that should never go out of business.
4	This is a solid coffee shop, and the mocha is absolutely amazing.  \n\nDownsides: they were a little busy so the drinks took FOREVER to make (I didn't mind cuz I was there to study but some other people were getting a little frustrated) - not a place you rush in and out of to get a quick caffeine fix. \n\nSomeone who I think works there (owner maybe?) was just standing around behind the register asking everyone if they wanted water while they waited because it would take a while.  That was thoughtful, except that the entire 20 minutes it took to make my drink, he never once lifted a finger to help the barista take orders or make drinks, and whenever there wasn't a customer actively paying at the register he was complaining to the barista (who was diligently trying to work quickly to make the drink orders that were piling up) about how several customers earlier were annoyed at how long the wait was.  He was also incredibly talkative to customers standing around, to the point of annoyance for many of them.  \n\nI might have given this place 3 stars for the annoyance factor, but the mocha was so good it deserves its own star for sure.
5	"""Fresh Bagel sandwiches are the best! Coda B was obviously still under the influence when he wrote his review because there is no \ $7 Arizona Classic\"""" here.

3	The Ross stores in Goodyear are inflation supremacists. Shirts that cost 9.99 in the metro area are 13.99 in Goodyear and my stiles are more sorted through up here. I'd say on average prices are 4-15 dollars more than regular ross stores. I still find great deals here and it's super clean, plus the shoppers and staff are more polite. It's a great stop for home goods but not clothes for adult males. All that said I have better luck here then the litchfield road location, which is very picked through. Hope this yelps... 3 stars only due to the king size sheet set I found there today that were super comfortable and only 15 dollars...
5	I feel like I'm in Plaza Mayor in Madrid, or a cafe in Paris. This has such a modern European cafe feel to it. I love it. I love the homemade pastries, mousses, and everything else. I've had the chocolate eclair- Which I wanted to LOVE but sadly the icing on top is a tad too sweet. But scrap some of that off and it's perfect. The iced coffee ( I like to bastardize my coffee with cream) is delicious. The large is MUY grande. Expect your thirst to be quenched. The Irish Cream mousse is tre bien. It's a little pricey, but worth it.
3	I had some extra time on my hands today so, being a huge music junkie, I decided to check this place out. I was overwhelmed upon walking in and received no help. It was really hard for me to find the used section. After searching I came to the conclusion that everything was mixed together. It definitely has nothing on Rasputin and I was extremely disappointed in the selection of used music. They did have some pretty good DVD deals and the guys that worked there were hot so for those reasons I'd return.
4	"""As already mentioned by other yelpers:\n\nThe best miso ramen in Phx.\n\nVery tasty soba noodles.\n\nKatsu chicken entree is also very good.\n\nNot pricey at all for what you get, which is a significant amount of very tasty food.   \n\nDecor: \nBooth seats.  Kind of out of date.  Just like any other mom and pop restaurant that has been open since the 80s.  Picture of a Japanese Kimono on the wall.  Not \cool\"""" in a \""""I wear D&G sun glasses and think RA has amazing sushi\"""" kind of way, but cool in a \""""this place has great food, who the hell cares what it looks like\"""" kind of way.\n\nService: \nDon't expect to be seated at a table and your drink order taken by a waiter.  We were handed two menus when we walked into the restaurant.  We took the menus and made our own way to a table to figure out what we wanted.  Once we had our mind set on what we wanted, I walked over to the cashier counter and placed our order with the owner.  Only time we interacted with the owner again was when our food and drinks were brought to our table, and when we got up and payed at the cashier counter.  So, yeah, you will not be waited on hand and foot.  But I think that aspect of the owner's personality somehow adds to the Toh Zan experience.  It's like, \""""You want what? To be served? LOL. First time?\"""""""""""
4	I went for the first time last weekend and we had a blast. We had dinner at Cowboy Ciao (which was phenomenal!!) and then one of the managers walked us over. It's a little hidden if you have never been before. \n\nSince they have such an extensive wine list I decided to try a wine flight. It was a great way for me to try several different wines, but I must say they were all very good. \n\nThe ambiance was dark and romantic. It was nice that I could still hear my date and carry on a great conversation. Didn't eat anything, but I saw several plates that looked fabulous!\n\nI can't wait to go back soon!
1	This place is for the absolute desperate. Literally, this basement is crawling with hungry people just hoping they find a good tasting crumb. I'm sorry to be the one to say this, but it's almost borderline pathetic! \n\nAfter going here, and reading the reviews now, I really have no clue why anyone would want other people's dirty crap. And when I say dirty, I don't mean a little worn, I mean mud stained, sweat stained shoes, purses with crap smeered on it. Horrible smelling clothes. Crying babies. Freaky people. Long lines. Who cares if it's labeled with some high end brand. Set yourself some standards, save yourself some time, and don't bother looking at Last Chance.
4	"""I decided I had to finally remove a star from my beloved Essence. I still love you, though. I don't even cheat on your macarons when I'm in Paris. Seriously, I'm not even tempted because I know I can go home and fill my mouth with your creamy delicious centers surrounded by a crunchy-chewy cookie later. \n\nNow that we have that established ...\n\nWhat is up with the service? The other day I was on hold for so long I gave up. Sometimes the line is practically out the door and no one moves any faster than if there was just one customer in front of them. Hell, sometimes the second person behind the counter ignores the line until they are done with what people in the biz call \side work.\"""" And the whole writing my coffee order on a post-it that no one reads? Yeah, that is not working. I know you guys are busy and it can be hard to juggle the rush, but sometimes I think maybe a little pep in your step would really help with that issue. Also, probably not a good idea to rely on the mythical creature that is supposed to read those post-its and pour coffee into a glass (he doesn't exist).  \n\nCan I just say one last thing ... the owner reminds me of a female Gordon Ramsay. When she comes out from the back, even I get scared. That woman is formidable. Don't get me wrong, this is a compliment. The woman is the shit and I am terrified of her. If she taught a cooking class, I'd take it and probably leave crying.\n\n5 stars for the food, I could eat it every day. \n5 stars for the hardcore bitch behind it all.\n3 stars for the sense of urgency no one has during a rush. \nLet's call it a 4."""""""
5	"""I've come here several times, and every time it's never a disappointment. The food is amazing, the service is great and the restaurant has some pretty cool decor. But, it's definitely not a \hippie\"""" place, probably because it's in such a trendy area.\n\nService is also pretty quick, although, almost everything I've ordered there has been one of their many unique pizzas. I did order one of their sandwiches once, and it was stuffed with so much, I had to take half of it home. Delicious!"""""""
5	After finally getting to try Pane Bianco - mainly because I couldn't get here during their business hours (they close at 3pm!), we made it.  And I am so glad!\n\nI love the simple menu and the fresh ingredients.  The bread alone is worth the trip and I always take home an extra loaf or two.  \n\nThe sandwiches are spectacular and the salads are second to none.  Be sure to order a piece of the flour-less chocolate cake and keep your fingers crossed that there's some left.  They run out on occasion.  \n\nThe staff is always excellent, just as they are at the other Bianco eateries.\n\nAnd now I've learned that Pane will be open for dinner starting Sept 24th with a simple menu of a couple of pizzas, salads and a special or two.  Our waiter wouldn't let us in on the details of who the chef would be, but he was very excited about it!
4	"""Sidebar is a trendy, hip down town bar located above Pei Wei and Starbucks.\nThe bar is small, the decor is modern with a retro feel (Urban Outfitters, maybe?), dark wood, curvy white bar stools, ambient music and muted lighting.\nThe beer and wine selection is good. A little pricey ($3 PBR, but at least they have it, and $5 Blue Moon), but not too bad. They have a good selection of spirits, too, Patron, Chopin Vodka, Booker's Bourbon, as well as the standard stuff, so there is definitely something for everyone.\nThe \smoking patio\"""" is a stairwell that leads outside the building. So, needless to say, it can get a little ridiculous with people crammed on the stairs puffing away.\nThe place was cool. The crowd was definitely the hip and trendy crowd, but not too pretentious. \nAfter a second trip here on New Year's Eve, I am sold. The cover was only $5, the staff is/was friendly, warm and welcoming. They have great drink specials, not just the price but great creations."""""""
5	Been a fan of this place since before Yelp! found it.  True it is not cheap.  True the time it takes to get your food is so looooong that you think they forgot about you.  BUT they didn't.  My tip - get your drink - fill it - drink it - re-fill it - repeat.  About the 2nd or 3rd refill is about the time you can expect to get your food.\n\nI am either boring or extremely loyal depending on your POV - if I find something that I like - I stick with it.  If I don't - I either try something else or never return to that establishment.  For this place - I get the Chick-Parm with Pasta salad.  It has never let me down!\n\nSince I live in CA - I only get to this place when I visit family - so it is a must-do when I visit.  Usually 3-4 times a year.  \n\nWhen I do make it here - I eat it up - then usually go home and sleep for a nice 2 hour nap. :)  Then I can return to visiting with the fam.
2	Gigi's has focused it's efforts on only the superficial.  Their marketing materials (signage, brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy.  That's appropriate for this type of business, but what about focusing on the core if what it's supposed to do --- making great cupcakes?  And having a wide selection from which to choose?\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes.  Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes!  I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six???  They're made of flour and water!!!  How much can it cost to keep a variety on hand?\n\nIn terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet.  The good news?  It was pretty to look at and well-packaged.
3	"""A group of my friends and I read about Barrio Cafe in The State Press Magazine's \Best Of\"""" edition.  Looking to squeeze something new and hopefully exciting out of the Phoenix Metro area, so the six of us decided to try it.\n\nThe wait was long...about an hour, and since not everyone was drinking  we waiting outside on a bench directly outside of the bar.\n\nThe wait wasn't as long as they said it would be and we were seated in one of the rooms of the low ceiling white wall adobe interior (ok, that makes it sound bad, because of the lighting, it was nice and cozy not stark and confining).\n\nWe ordered the Guacamole to start because it is supposed to be their \""""signature\"""" as it is made fresh right in front of your eyes at the table.  Apparently quite the draw for most patrons as our server informed us that  EVERYONE ordered it and that she and the rest of the servers all really hated making it (that made us feel GREAT).  The guacamole was however worth it (even if it was insinuated upon us ordering it that we were 'restaurant tourists')\n\nThere were basically no vegetarian options and it was quite the scoffing matter on the part of our server when I requested a substitute of beans on a chicken dish (\""""We don't serrrve beans here.\"""")  I wound up getting the same dish, just without chicken.\n\nAll of the dishes (veggie or not) were small for the price (and for being a full dinner).  \n\nThe margarita I had was tasty, but not enormous (I think it was about $10).  I like a big margarita with Mexican food, call me crazy.\n\nThere was a live duo that played for a while during our supper.  They were entertaining, but not too distracting and still allowing for conversation at our table.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups (it's pretty small), there seemed to be a number of large groups there which I found interesting.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I had the opportunity to check this place out, but it's definitely not first on my list of places to go back to immediately."""""""
5	This place is absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend and I have been here for a few special occasions and have never been dissappointed, the food is amazing and the service is just as good, our waiter was so unbelievably nice. Their steak could possibly be the best steak I have ever eaten, and their creme brulee is to die for. This place even does complimentary filet mignon sandwiches for happy hour...guarantee you will love this place just as much as we do!
5	I haven't actually taken a class at the studio in Scottsdale, but I have taken them at the studio in Mesa. There are many things I love about the Karve classes. You don't have to have a membership which means you just pay for the classes you take (of course there are packages which let you prepay for multiple classes or unlimited periods of time). I also love that the instructors will admit that some things are even challenging for them. They are professionals, but they have a relaxed attitude which really helps make you feel comfortable even if you are struggling. Additionally, I love that the class is as difficult as you make it. There are ways to adjust positions in order to make it easier or more challenging. For example, you can add weights for arm exercises or just not use any weights. A lot of the workout depends on how much you challenge yourself. Knowing how to control your muscles individually can help you get results sooner, but if don't know how to do this, you will learn after a few classes. Anyone can do these classes and the instructors help with positions and anything else you need. I really do enjoy Karve. My issue is simply finding time to squeeze into my busy schedule. I wish the Mesa studio had classes at 5:15 am or at 7-7:30 PM. Another thing that would be helpful is if they would offer specials for clients who haven't been in awhile or who refer friends. Karve is a great way to exercise and you see results very quickly!
5	Way to go Center for Gentle Dentistry!  One of the worst aspects of moving to a new city is finding a new dentist.  They are typically under-reviewed on websites like this, and ones specifically aimed at dentistry always seem to cost money (ridiculous!)  \n\nI am pleased to announce that I will be heading to Dr. Chatterjee until the day that I either move far away or lose all of my teeth and only have to go to Walgreens for an update on Denture Adhesive.\n\nI am not what you would say, a dentist enthusiast.  I resent going there, and if not for Bonnie's gentle reminder phone calls Theres a decent chance that I would have missed all of my appointments.  Procedures are painless, I will admit I had a cavity or two and Dr. Chatterjee and her staff were really conscious of my fear.  The procedures were over in a snap too.\n\nI've had two dental insurance companies with the Center for Gentle Dentistry, and they took both and fought for pre-auth's when necessary.  I would highly recommend Ms. Chatterjee!
5	We attended the Las Noches de las Luminarias again this year and since I've been away out of the country for the last four months, upon returning I can appreciate more the beauty and serenity of this particular desert botanical garden.  The night was perfect, not too cold, not too hot and there were 12 different musician stations playing throughout the garden.  \nAmazing part was when you are at each station, you felt like it was its own private concert, with no interference from the other musician stations.\nA lovely evening of great food and company spent in a lovely atmosphere!
5	"""Love love LOVEE Spinato's. Their red sauce is to die for, perfectly sweet and tangy! \n\nCalzones are fabulous as well, especially the spinach, garlic & tomato one. Wards off hoardes of vampires, I'm sure. Warning - these don't reheat well. Plan on eating it all fresh.\n\nNormally multi-meat pizzas make me want to ralph from greasiness, but their \Get Meaty\"""" is really good, the sausage (I think?!) has a nice smokey flavor that goes well with the sweet sauce.\n\nI go to the location in Tempe, but I believe they make their food in one place, so you shouldn't get much of a difference as far as quality goes."""""""
4	My husband suggested that we go to Buffalo Wings and Rings for dinner. I think I might have rolled my eyes thinking what am I going to eat (being a vegetarian)? \n\nThere are actually several items on the menu specifically for vegetarians. I did not have to special order anything! Which is unusual for me. The Greek pita was fabulous. The dressing actually comes in container that you add on the pita so that it doesn't get soggy. The potato chips are fabulous and made right there on site. \n\nThe staff was friendly and quite prompt. The manager came and chatted with us. I was impressed with how observant the waitress was. \n\nI did not take advantage of the wonderful beer selection but look forward to it in the future! \n\nI look forward to returning.
4	Netflix offers a good service for the money.  Streaming + 2 disks out at a time for less than it would cost for me and one other to go to the movies once.\n\nTo answer the review by Rahul who talked about the delay between Netflix and being able to purchase a disk: I feel your pain, but that is not Netflix's fault, but rather the movie studios who FORBID Netflix to rent until the disk has been available for purchase for a month or so.  Remember that Netflix doesn't own the movies any more than you do when you buy them, and they have to abide by the license agreement if they don't want to be sued into oblivion.
3	The food was slightly above average, but the service was slow and below average, overall, a good choice if you are in the area, but not worth the drive.  It is a decent space at the end of a strip mall (how unusual) and on a warmer night, I can imagine sitting outside would be a nice.  \n\nWe were seated relatively quickly on a busy night; fortunately we had a reservation because the place was packed.  As a result, I had the pleasure of hearing the manager complaining to one of the waiters that table ## and ## and ## were all behind!  Tacky, and given that they place a table by the serving station, something a good manager should realize.  Of course later, I would discover why the tables were behind.\n\nApparently the fries are a big item, so we tried a small size, which is more than enough for 2 people, unless one of you is a linebacker.  The fries are good and come with 3 different sauces, one of which is a truffle ketchup.  A creative combination, but it just tastes like ketchup with some truffle oil.  \n\nFor entrees, I had the Amy's Bolognese, which is massive.  It is half a plate of polenta, half a plate of Bolognese, which tasted and looked  like spiced ground beef in a dark red sauce (think higher quality manwich), and a large piece of French bread.  It was good, albeit rather simple.  The chicken pot pie, with a puffed-bread on top (as the bread element) used sage at the just-right level and apparently was very good.  Finally, the profiteroles with in-house ice cream were very good.\n\nThe biggest problem, aside from the table next to us constantly commenting on our food - People, we didn't come with you, so leave us alone (I'm sorry your life is so boring, but really) - was the very slow service.  It took quite a long time for someone to come to the table and to check on us in between.  In addition, he was constantly encouraging us to eat more of whatever we had left.   Hey buddy...I need run 10 miles on Sunday and I am not planning on doing so with 5 extra pounds!  I even had to ask for the bill, which I don't mind in Europe, but is very unusual in AZ at this level.\n\nI would give it another shot, but it did not live up to my expectations.
5	Really this place doesn't need another great review. All I will say is that I miss this place. This was a regular place for my husband and I for four years. Funny considering its called Four Peaks. Okay, enough of that. \nOverall, great beer (although selection never changes), great food, and a excellent atmosphere if you can get a spot outside. Personally I'll wait to be seated so I can enjoy the wonderful AZ afternoons and nights. I don't think I'm alone.
5	I was wandering around downtown Scottsdale yesterday in desperate need of a manicure and felt so lucky that Bernadette was able to fit me in last minute. She really took her time and did a careful job on my nails. She's also incredibly sweet and fun to talk to.  \n\nShe has a small studio and it's just her so definitely call ahead to make an appointment or see if she can fit you in. \n\nOverall an extremely pleasant experience and would highly recommend!
2	Friday's food has always been consistent, but my first time at this location wasn't great. The food was fine, but our table was dark, we had to ask for utensils, they put onions on my salad when I asked for it without, and it smelled. It's that grease trap smell and we kept getting whiffs of it throughout dinner. Blech! Also, as with many places, they don't list their beer-on-tap prices. Fine, but the waiter should at least know what they are when we ask.
5	We came here Sunday for lunch.   Wow, what a great time we had.  \nLots of parking in the lot and nice and cool inside,as it was a scorching hot day out there.   There was no line even though it was about 1:00pm. We were seated at the perfect booth for two.\nThey brought water right away, then our drinks while we getting our food.\nYou just do not know where to start. The selection is just like Vegas Baby.  Only $35.00 plus tax for 2. Which is called Sunday Champagne. We did not drink any alcohol, but you can get it if you like.  \nThe food is fantastic.  Seafood, meat, chicken, Salmon was excellant!    It had a steady flow of people but, no line ever.  With Prime Rib and Ham, even an Omlette bar. Lobster Omlette.....Real mashed potaoes as well.\nRest rooms were shiny and clean.  We will be back very soon.
3	This is one of those places that is basically overrated just because of its location and longevity. There are so few places that have survived in the downtown Phoenix area for as long as China Chili has, and for that, it probably does deserve a lot of credit. \n\nThat being said, it's basically an average Chinese restauant. Comfortable, convenient, clean, and it offers all the standard fare. It's everything you'll need for a weekday dinner, but not much more.\n\nTry the sizzling rice soup. It's very good. Plus Jerry Colangelo is known to take out their sweet 'n' sour shrimp...or is it the chicken? Who cares, either way, that's pretty cool.
5	I can't say enough good things about this place or the owners. My 1st time at Liberty Market, my friend and I ended up chatting with the owners (Kiersten and David) for a short while before eating. On our next visit, weeks later, they remembered us AND our names. Impressive. Not only that, we came in as they were closing and they still accommodated us. Talk about service. \n\nEvery single thing I've ordered from their menu has been amazing. The pizzas are really great, especially the White pizza. The Italia salad is also delicious. Portions are big, sharing is caring my friends.\n\nSide note: Make sure to check out the bathrooms. Each stall has a different theme and music to go along with it. We made sure to lock ourselves in each and every stall to get the full experience.
4	I always go to Radioshack when I have some off the wall gizmo that I need to buy. I recently bought some new phones for the house. After taking out the phones from the packaging the fine print in the instructions indicated that I needed a DSL Filter if I had the internet bundled with my phone. Funny, that little detail wasn't anywhere on the box of the product.\n\nSo I just strolled into the store and showed the workers the literature of what I needed and they immediately plucked the product on the counter and I was outta there. That's how I like to do my shopping, no fuss and no hassle.
4	A perfect way to start the day!\nJust had breakfast here and it was great! Staff was friendly, owner was available and attentive. Did not feel rushed to get out like at so many local breakfast places. Noise level was very low (again, not like other places that assault your ears first thing). Food came out fast. Caraf of coffee and water (so appreciated!) Prices were great! We had french toast - great! With REAL warmed maple syrup. And eggs benedict - yummy! Cooked to perfection. I love that it is locally owned and the owner is there making sure things go ok.
5	I've been going to the Cornish Pasty Co. for years now.  I love the atmosphere of this little place, it is small and cozy. The service is good... i have never had a bad experience with the service and had a couple of really good ones. I actually wrote a poem about one of the waitresses but I'm not going to go into that. \n\nNow with that out of the way I can talk about the food. I love these little Pasties! My personal favorite is the Pilgrim... but the Chicken Rosemary, Stake Rosemary and Cajan are wonderful too, not to mention the Bangers & Mash, and Shepard's Pie. \n\nAfter all this... one of my families favorite this to do is just order a half dozen pasties to go and bring them home and just smorgasbord!
3	Although the food, wine, and atmosphere are all good, sadly I must say I have been let down. One of my problems is the sometimes slow service. Also we decided to go here for a friends birthday and they ran out of food. It was not fun feeling like you had the angel of death for a server ready to kill your order. I really would love to give the place four stars, because the food and wine are certainly worth it, but due to my traumatic experience its just a-ok. Maybe I will get a chance to go back and update my review to what I know it really could be.
4	What a nice hotel! My fiance and I enjoyed every bit of our stay. The grounds are very well manicured and the architecture is something to look at. Even in July with the hot weather, the hotel was pretty crowded. Lots of families with money to burn. \n\nThere are 8 pools spread around the property and they each seem to have a different atmosphere. The two pools we went to were the large ones right in the middle of the property with the slide and the swim-up bar. If you have some extra cash, get yourself an $8 beer (!) in the bottle. Otherwise, bring your own. The slide is fun. It doesn't go as fast as I'd like but it's something to do at the pool. The big downside at the pools is that the hot weather heats them up so much that they should actually be cooled off. They were probably 90 degrees... bath water. Not as refreshing as you'd like them to be.\n\nThe buildings and rooms are very nice, clean, spacious, neat and comfortable. I could have taken a nap all day in our room. One drawback is that some buildings and rooms are far from the parking lot. You have quite a ways to walk if you don't valet.\n\nWith the recession and hot weather, rates are pretty low right now for this excellent hotel. Give it a shot.
4	I've heard about this place for ages and finally went with some friends to check it out yesterday. It was a cloudy day, and a bit cold, so a perfect day to have some sort of insight experience and the musical instrument museum did not disappoint. The cost was a bit more than I expected but the museum is interesting and seems incredibly well run.\n\nYou get a headset when you pay your admissions fee and the museum is set up so that as you get near a display you start to pick up the sound of the video of instruments being played. One thing the museum may want to do is more clearly indicate to people that they headsets don't work till you get to the second floor. I saw the sign but many people seemed to be confused as to why nothing was coming on as they walked through the initial display of various types of guitars.\n\nI did learn, at the end, that if you have kids, you want to take them to the experience area (sorry, a bit fuzzy on the details) so they get a chance to play different instruments, or at least that was my understanding, and then you can go look at the second floor displays.\n\nInterestingly enough, they start with musical instruments from Africa and Asia, the most ancient cultures and then move towards the types of instruments with which we are more familiar whereas, if I also remember correctly, the musical instruments at the Metropolitan museum of arts where much more European based and they had recordings of the actual instruments being played and I sort of expected I would experience that as well here but they have a different though logical approach. I just find a deeper sense of connection when i know that the sound I'm playing was actually generated on the actual instrument I'm viewing.\n\n\nDefinitely worth a look-see if you have a free afternoon on the weekend. Sunday seems like an especially good day to go visit but Sunday afternoon always seems like a good time to go to any museum. I also saw they have actual musical performances though many of them are during the week and that is quite a drive if you don't life out that way (at least for me) but might also be worth checking out if you get a chance.
4	My latest neighborhood find. I am a fan due to location and ambiance, although a little loud (the music is loud and you have to yell over it to talk, and so does everyone else) and slightly darker than I like to truly see what I am eating. As for the food, it's not the best I have had but the quality was there. \nOn this visit I decided to try a few items to get a good idea of overall quality. \nI had the following: \ngeisha roll, which has ahi tataki, cucumber, lotus root, cream cheese, and red bell peppers \nosuimono, a soup with ebi & japanese cucumber, snow peas, carrots w/ ginger in clear broth \nmaguro (tuna) nigiri \n\nThe roll was tasty and just the right size for enjoying in one large yet manageable bite. (I am not a fan of large ricey fat rolls that take 2-3 bites to eat civilly). The soup came in a cast-iron pot with enough for one person to make a nice meal out of or could be split among 3-4 as a starter. I loved the vegetables I was expecting a little more from the broth, which was as simple as the standard vietnamese pho broth, and as a result I started craving the little plate of lime, cilantro and maybe some hoisin. I would have liked to have tasted more ginger in the broth. The nigiri had nice fresh tuna and didn't disappoint. \nI did have some take home left overs perfect for brunch the next day. \n\nI do have a few nit picky things to add, the chairs at the sushi bar, as described accurately by one reviewer as revamped grocery carts, I found them to be awkward to get into and out of. I am just over 5' and I have to take a running leap into the typical bar stool anyway but these were different, getting out of them was more challenging than normal. Once in place I was ok (I have plenty of booty to make up for the lack of a cushion...lol). Again the volume in the restaurant was more than I like. Although I enjoyed the hip music selection. \n\nI will go again, most likely for happy hour or the reverse happy hour I hear (read) about. I would also like to try many of the unique cocktails on the drink menu.
2	Well, wish I could say this place was top notch, as the service was good. The Manapua was very tasty as was the Macaroni salad. The chicken katsu was unfortunately the worst I've had in the valley. The Bulkogi beef was okay but nothing special. One thing that should be mentioned is they only serve dark meat and white meat mixed chicken in their chicken dishes, and white meat only is not even an option. So if you are pretty much white meat only person like me this place is pretty much a no go.
4	A quaint place located in the heritage district in Gilbert.  If you are lucky, you can get right in and get a table.  The staff is very pleasant and the food is actually really good.  I always get a scramble and a cup of coffee.  A scramble is basically an omelet that was smarter then the cook and kind of exploded everywhere.  Customize one to your liking and you will be happy.  The restaurant can be very crowded sometimes... but can't blame them... you Arizonans are slow eaters.  Remember, always eat locally.
5	The hubski and I visited Va Bene after reading some glowing reviews.\nI love this place because its a haven for cougars as well as $10,000 millionaires. Lets face it, sometimes its fun to be a $10,000 millionaire.\nWe have been back many times, and every time are greeted by Sasha, the manager, and by our favorite waiters. Maybe this is because of the impression ( and 10 business cards) the hubski leaves everywhere he goes, or maybe everyone gets this treatment, but Va Bene is kind of like our Cheers now.\nThe place has great decor and magnificent food, but you can eat for as little as $11 or as much as $35 per plate. The tiramisu is out of this world, as is the tartufo. What, you may ask, is a tartufo? Picture this and be prepared to salivate (maybe have a tissue on hand). A tartufo is a scoop of sorbet, chocolate or raspberry, dipped in chocolate (dark, I think), re-frozen, sliced on a bed of fresh whipped cream, and drizzled with chocolate or raspberry syrup. Unbelievable.\nI have ordered something different every time I go, and I never cease to be delighted. The first time was the most special though- the fish of the day. It was halibut on top of sauteed spinach and feta mashed potatoes. That's right. Feta. Indulgent.\nNice bar, great wine list. We'll be back soon.
4	"""This place is great!  It's not only a used bookstore, but it's a giftshop, too!  There were fun greeting cards and comical trinkets (\Believe in God Breath Freshener\"""") aplenty.  Along with the Irish Gift store on University, it's another great place to go if you're looking for a gift for someone difficult to shop for!  There's got to be something here that fool will like.\n\nThe shop is also connected to the Wildflower Bread Company so that you can enjoy some carb-y treats with coffee before or after your shopping experience (not too sure if they let you bring food in the store).  \n\nI was a little disappointed, however, with the book prices.  Accustomed to McKay's, a used bookstore in Knoxville, TN, I thought this store might have prices as low as theirs (i.e., $1-5 for a paperback).  I was perusing the Kurt Vonnegut novels and I think the cheapest one I found was $11 or $12.  I mean, that's not steep or anything, but I would have expected to find the same price at Barnes and Noble or Borders.  The only hot spot for low prices I found in the store was the sale section at the back.  There are some gems back there, but you have to spend a little time looking.  I was really proud of the big book on dreaming I bought for only 75 cents!\n\nThe store also has authors come in every week to talk about their work.  Book discussions range from kid- to adult-oriented, from non-fiction to fiction, from sci-fi to romance.  You can peruse the schedule on their website.  I'm sure this feature is one big reason why the bookstore has received so many accolades in professional journals and popular publications alike.  \n\nOverall, I was impressed with this place.  Although it's not as cheap as the used bookstores I'm used to (the reason for the 4-stars), it still provides the quintessentially one-of-a-kind-bookshop experience."""""""
3	Good for brunch.  They have more traditional Mexican food selections such as chorizo and eggs, and huevos rancheros, in addition to more fusion type brunch items such as seafood crepes.  I had the chorizo and eggs, which was very well prepared.  The eggs were perfectly done (over easy), the chorizo was flavorful and spicy, and the potatoes were perfectly grilled.  Prices are on the more expensive side for what you get (10 dollars and up), and some items such as aguas frescas will run you a whopping $5 for a glass, but all in all it was a nice meal.  Therefore, 4 stars for the meal, but minus a star for the prices.
1	Guys, what happened?!?  I ordered a burger and fries for lunch yesterday and the burger wasn't just bad... it was disgusting.  The meat tasted off; I was kind of afraid that it was spoiled. Then it was raw inside. And the bun had a rancid grease smell to it. I'm not sure if it was the oil that was brushed on the bun to grill it, or if the grill was so dirty that the rancid smell transferred from grill to bun. But either way, it was just nasty. I could only get through a couple bites of the burger before I tossed the enitre thing. $10 for lunch totally down the drain. I was so disappointed. The Italian Beef I had last time was just ok, and after this burger experience I will most likely not be back.
4	Loved the food and experience, and the service. I would however reserve this for a special occasion. We had dinner and a couple drinks for two and it was $145 plus the tip. I would not go here on a regular basis. My drink was great, it had 5 different kinds of rum in it. \n\nWe did have fun though...We had the Wisconsin Cheese appetizer and then the caesar salads and the creme brulee for desert. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the cost.  They do have happy hour specials between 4-6 pm that sound good.
5	"""If you're in the mood for chicken tenders and fries, this is the place for you!! If not....don't come here because the menu options are limited!!! \n\nWent here at around 12am Thursday night and were immediately greeted by a super friendly cashier. He was really great. It was our first time here so he explained the menu and what not. Ordered the \3 FINGER\"""" (3 chicken tenders, crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, regular size drink, side of cane sauce). \n\nThe food was delivered to our table promptly. The chicken was SUPER hot, I couldn't eat for 10 minutes. Fries were good but the portions were really small :/ I really didn't even want the Texas toast at first thinking eww a big piece of bread? But it's actually REALLLY good!!! The meal came with a side of their secret sauce which was pretty tasty. \n\nThe customer service was great, an employee checked up on us to see if we needed anything and offered to throw out our trash. The place was very clean and seemed well kept. I will come back again if I ever need a fix for fried chicken deliciousness"""""""
5	I have been a customer at Big O Tires for years.  Been to many different store through out the country and this is one of the best ones that I have been to.  The service was fast.  The prices where fair and they informed me of online coupons that I could use for the future.  I compared tire prices with Discount and Big O is right in line with comparable tires.  The nice thing about Big O is they can do alignments when they put on the new tires unlike Discount Tire.  I would highly rec. you go and see them for all your automotive needs.  Again great service and prices and a great group of guys that work the front counter.
5	We were looking for someplace different to go to in the neighborhood.  I have driven by Osha Thai many times and decided to stop in.  Wow, am I glad we did!  Everything about this place is great. Great food, Great prices, Great Service.\n\nWe started out with chicken lettuce wraps and Mee Grab.  For our entree's we had Ginger (Pad Khing Sod) with chicken,  Spicy Cashew Beef and a noodle dish.  Everything was better than the next!  \n\nI'm looking forward to the next visit!
4	I totally agree with the other yelpers about how Phoenix really needs more places like this.  I love the sidewalk patio dining and cool downtown location.\n\nThere was a large selection of food from oysters on the half shell to artisan cheeses to fish and chips to steak to popcorn shrimp.  With such lack of culinary focus one might think mediocrity would come with every dish, but I happily report not.  We had oysters, skirt steak, bread and roasted vegetables, and some small assorted plates.  Everything was fantastic.\n\nThe combination of urban patio, eclectic menu, and great service make for a fun meal.  The one complaint I have is the price.  It's quality food but I did feel a little taken.  For instance, a draft beer was nearly $6 (I see it as an index since beer, even when hand crafted, is like the cheapest stuff on earth).  Anyway, it loses one star for the gouge but people with deeper pockets and looser fingers may add the star back.
5	I needed to go to Urgent Care a couple weeks ago. \n\nThis place was the closest so off we went. \n\nThe waiting area leaves much to be desired, but whatever. We waited for maybe 20 minutes before being called back. \n\nThe nurse who saw me was very nice and friendly and truly seemed concerned about me. \n\nThere was never more then 15-20 minutes that went by that the nurse or doctor wasn't in my room. \n\nI wish I remembered the doctors name, she was sooo nice! (young with short hair and just adorable) She was very concerned about me, they did an EKG and xray on my lungs which looked great but she felt I needed blood work done more urgently then they can provide and strongly urged me to go to the ER. \n\nThe rooms are old but there was a tv in there to keep us entertained. \n\nIf I ever needed to go to an Urgent Care again I would not hesitate to go here again.
5	"""Eba cafe is amazing. The boba tea here is some of the best I've had, and it's so reasonably priced. I also love that they take cards! It seems every other little asian tea house takes cash only, and who the hell carries cash on them? They have a large menu of food, as well as tons of different drink options. They also sell gelato, lots of little random knickknack items, and Eba clothing. Oh - another great plus, they have punch cards! The perfect way to reward all of us boba addicts. \n\nAnyhow, this place is great. It's laid back, they have better hours (then that \other\"""" boba place ;) ), and the owner (?) is super friendly. Not to mention it's even CLOSER to my place than that \""""other\"""" boba place. Yay!\n\n*If you are unaware of the \""""other\"""" boba place, feel free to check out my Lollicup review(s). Support Eba!!!"""""""
4	Fancy this is not.  It's more like a teleport to one of the restaurants you find a few blocks south of the border for lunch when on a shopping trip in Mexico.  I've been to Los Olivos several times over the last few years and it's decent, typical southern AZ mexican fare.  Get something fried.  Don't be in a hurry.  Bring a friend and enjoy their company while you munch and drink.  Los Olivios doesn't pretend to be something it's not - it's just serving everyday Arizona style Mexican food without fooling around.
5	I have been going to Sassy Glasses since I moved out here, about 4 or 5 years.\n\nI originally went for their frame selection - which is FANTASTIC!\nI think of eyeglass frames as jewelry, and since I need them on my face 24/7, I always have a few pairs. (You wouldn't wear the same pair of earrings every day, would you? Well, ok, I wouldn't).\n\nThey definitely have the coolest frames in town - not necessarily the trendy boring 'names'; these are mostly European & Japanese cutting-edge style, but with enough 'interesting' basics for your everyday pair.\n\nThey are locally-owned, unlike most other shops in the Valley.\nAnd to the previous reviewer who said they do not make their own lenses - well, I have news for you, I don't think I've EVER been to a shop that DID - even when I lived in NYC and Boston - at least for my prescription, which is a VERY complicated one, prisms and astigmatism and progressives and diopters. No matter where I've lived, my lenses ALWAYS take a week to order and receive.\n\nWhich brings me to - Ouida & Dan take the TIME to make sure they have my prescription and measurements CORRECT, unlike another nameless chain place I went to here in the Valley once (and will never return to).  They KNOW what they are doing. \n\nAnd they are really really nice, unlike some of the snobby shops so prevalent in the Valley. Have been in a few of those places to browse and I felt like I was being scoped out as to whether I could afford the frames or something! (and I try not to dress like a schlump). And I have no confidence that those places would get my lens correct, anyway.\n\nS.G. even made me a special pair of glasses to wear for when, as I normally do, sit with my laptop in my lap with the TV on, with the progressive line moved way up so I could see both.\n\nSassy Glasses IS a bit pricey, but I've discovered (see above) that you get what you pay for, at least on the lenses.\nWhich is why I am a long-term customer.
4	Postino's has the best brushetta around. Fresh ingredients and a marvelous wine list to go with it. It is always busy but if you go a little early for lunch it is easier to get in.  The parking can be rough but plan ahead and it is worth it.\nThis is one place with food and atmosphere to rival one of my favorite places in Florence Italy.  Don't rush, be patient and above all be open minded.  You may discover a dish you would have never considered and love it.
4	I have found that during the summer on a Sunday morning before 930 is the best time to go to Matt's....at least that is my favorite time.   Why you may ask? No wait!  I have yet to wait in line at all when I go that early.  But mostly I have been by myself and I find a seat at the counter.  \n\nWhile I scan through the specials, I find myself more often than not, getting the Hog and Chick with Bacon and Hashbrowns.  I have tried the sausage patties and the ham.  I was not impressed by the saugage and while the ham is VERY good, the bacon still wins out.  The hashbrowns alone keep coming back for more and I am not a big potatoe fan.\n\nBut I admit I am spoiled living just a few blocks away....
5	"""I operate the \Hot Dog Guy\"""" Cart in Cave Creek, and have been using Suzanne's \""""Hot Stuff\"""" Original Habenero Sauce on my menu for many years.  The guests LOVE IT!...

3	Everyone has their own idea of how pasta sauce should taste, unfortunately D'Falcos isn't the best in my opinion. I like my mom's much more especially with her Sicilian upbringing I might be asking too much. But their eggplant is awesome it makes my tummy rumble just thinking about it. What I also feel needs improvement is I wish they were open a bit later. For Italian food than is adequate as a dinner entre being open later than 8pm on weeknights would be appreciated but then again im just one person. I do like that they are very similar to the new york city delis and that is something I definitely dig.
2	(After not having a good experience at the other place owned by the same person...being insulted by bartender) My boyfriend and I wanted mexican food. The owner of both this place and Rythym and Wine, should reconsider the hiring process of the staff. We walked in around 8 pm, well before closing. The staff could have cared less and were just wanting to get ot of there. The food was good, but we will never go back to either place, not matter how cool the lights in the trees are!
5	Well In-N-Out burger you have one hell of a burger... I have been eating at this location for years and never had a bad meal I want to go get it right now as I write this... Many might not know about the secret menu I put this to the test my last visit and sure enough they knew about it all. So on you next visit you will have a whole new experience... Try this site for new menu options: http://www.badmouth.net/in-n-outs-secret-menu/   I was happy I did we were able to order a Neapolitan shake it rocked and the Animal Style Fries off the chart... You need to do everything Animal Style anyways... Great burger place I will be back many times I know it.
4	I don't get all the negativity! We went there..  me, my guy, my son, and my daughter. 20 bucks. No joke. And it's not gross. Some of the enchilada sauce was a little closer to ketchup, but it really wasn't bad. I loved some of it, and the sopapillas in themselves bumped this place up a star. Mmmm with honey and sugar right there on the table for ya. This was a good idea, I'm glad we went. Oh, and the waiter was so nice. Everyone in there was super nice. The owner told me ways to try the sopapillas when I went up for more. \nI'm rating this as a BUFFET, because that's what it is. Did you really expect gourmet in a mexican buffet? come on..
5	I love having this place so close to my house. My husband and I walked there yesterday and I picked up a jump rope and a 10lb medicine ball for 35 bucks total. I am going back again today (with the truck) to get a bench, a stepper platform thingy and a chest press bar. Wish I had a whole room in the house for just gym stuff. Going to have to get creative with where I will put these things. \n\nThis place seems to have everything for almost every sport. It even has a skateboard-ski thing which is like a board on the top but instead of wheels it has four mini-skis. Good selection of cleats, wrestling shoes (didn't know there was such a thing), and other sports shoe types. Has steppers, treadmills, ellipticals, gym exercise machines, dumbbells, and tons more. Awesome!

4	"""It's 1-Star, it's 5-Stars, it's 1-Star, it's 5-Stars.  WHAT?\u00bf?\n\nI'll give the critics that this place looks scary & dinky on the outside, but once inside it's actually mid-sized; a little worn, but I found it comfortable... funky but chic, as David Johansen would say.  Of course the real questions are, \Is it 1-Star, or is it 5-Stars?  Should I have brought my friends with me, or an ambulance?\""""  From the look of the outside, I was thinking I'd better have the ambulance lined up, at least, but I settled for dialing 9-1 on my cell (ok, figuratively speaking), & lurched in through the door.\n\nI washed up in the CLEAN bathroom, & started with my usual appetizer, Hot & Sour Soup, which was feisty!  It's a good thing they give you a big glass of water!\n\nBack at the (infamous) serving line, there were 31 main trays.  The salad was good, with some interesting Chinese non-cucumber round things there to add in, & their Honey-Mustard dressing was excellent.  Now fried rice is FRIED!  You can't make it without some oil, people!  With that said, the pork fried rice was just fine, & it was NOT GREASY!  ...And the infamous, \""""Spam Lo Mein?\""""  The others forgot to tell you that it's GOOD!  (& no, of course it's not Spam!  To me, it tasted much closer to USDA Reconstituted Meat Byproduct Protein #4...  Ok, \""""Spam\"""" for short.).\n\nMoving on, there were the WORLD'S BEST FRENCH FRIES!  How did THAT get left out of everyone's reviews?  (The potato sticks are dipped in a Tempura batter & then fried to be crispy outside but soft in the middle...  Really good!)\n\nThe staff?  Friendly & appreciative!  The service?  Excellent!  Server lady picked up my zillion empty plates as I ate, & kept my drink full.  That's all there is for co to do when it's a buffet!\n\nSo the place was empty, right?  NO!  It had LOTS of customers for the size of the place, especially on a Tuesday morning.\n\nLunch Buffet:  $6.25 - I think it's real good."""""""
5	I have been taking my vehicles to Stanley's since 1986.  I have a business in Mesa AZ and drive every one of our vehicles out to Phoenix just to have Stanley's work on them.  They are the most honest place I have ever dealt with, they never try and sell me a repair I don't need, and they have never been unable to repair my vehicles.  Everyone that works at shop knows what they're doing and their attention to detail is impeccable.  I can't imagine ever going to another mechanic.
3	i haven't been here since it was called Sonora, not much has changed. the food is pretty decent. i no longer drink alcohol so i got the rootbeer. it's pretty good. i actually like Stevia, and was happier knowing there was no sugar or HFCS\n\ni actually like the fact a restaurant is trying to get away from HFCS. kudos.\n\ni tried the Buffalo, i kinda thought it was a burger...but only because i wasn't really paying attention.  but it was tasty, 3 basted chicken strips on a roll with lettuce and tomato and nasty red onion...no...not saying their red onion was nasty..i just don't like red onion on sandwiches.. sorry. \n\nanyways..they added Sweet Potato fries to the menu and they were pretty good. they crinkle cut them..i think it adds more to the experience.
4	I can't wait to go back and try their sushi.  \n\nI did enjoy the dish I ordered (see pictures) and it was my first attempt of korean food outside of BBQ.  The Kimchee was spicy but I still want more.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  I let her know it was my first time trying real korean food and helped me figure out what i would like best and tips on how to set up my plate.\n\nSo I had a beer, some soup, some dinner and watched football.  Too bad I was too full to order dessert.
3	Fuego Bistro has some good points. I tried it today during my lunch hour. 1) It's about 45 seconds from my office. Freaky. 2) They serve meatloaf as a special and it was char-broiled. Crazy. 3) They have a nice patio. I arrived a bit early (note 1) and waited for the very friendly waitress to exit the kitchen. She seated me on the patio after wiping down the table and chairs after an overnight rain shower had hit. I could tell they were definitely behind on the opening of the restaurant for that day, but once we were seated, they were very attentive. The black beans that came with my meatloaf were delicious, and the rice was good, too. My friend ordered the empanadas and appeared to enjoy them immensely. It's probably not a place I would crave (generally speaking), but if I had another South American food craving or a random meatloaf craving, this is probably the most convenient place for me to satisfy it. Prices were in the $8--12 range for lunch, higher for dinner.
2	The location is good, and the patio can be wonderful on a winter afternoon.  The food, however, seems to be about 20% overpriced for what you receive.  It isn't bad, mind you, but it certainly isn't worth the prices they charge.  The bar area gets very, very crowded on Friday nights, which can be good or bad, depending on what you're in the mood for.  It is a nice place for drinks, and maybe appetizers.  Skip it for dinner, though, and try someplace else within walking distance in old town Scottsdale.
5	"""I am one of those weirdos who come to Sweet Tomatoes for salad and vegetarian soup. You know, healthy food. Food that makes your colon look up to you and say \thank you,\"""" to which you reply \""""no, thank YOU.\"""" I don't come here for the greasy, bready pizza and flavorless old-people pasta - although the lemon cream and caper pasta is so delicious I want to fill a swimming pool with it and... but I digress.\n\nSo how hard is this, right? It's a salad bar. get fresh veg, cut it up, serve it. Have competent dressings (their Greek is quite good) and BAM - you're done (except for an ironic month a while back where they had signs up about not having any tomatoes on the bar because of some crop devastation or I don't know what). Ah but the soups - what I love about Sweet Tomatoes versus other salad joints which shall go unnamed is their soups. They always have a couple of vegetarian options and they are uniformly delicious (if somewhat lacking in salt, but let's get real - this place is for geriatrics, not soccer parents).\n\nAnother thing I appreciate about Sweet Tomatoes is that they don't try to get their busboys to act like they're waiters. Thanks, no, I don't need a glass of Phoenix tapwater ice for my bottle of purified water. Thanks, no, I doubt I'm going to need to ask you for anything, IT'S SELF-SERVE. But they do come around and offer you cookies. Those are the kinds of nice touches that make me come back."""""""
5	This is the 2nd time we have been here and we can't wait to go back.                      The staff is so friendly and the Food is excellant!                                                          They even always give you a little sample of what is on the menu.              Wednesday is half price wine night. So we got a wonderful bottle of wine for only $17.00 and it was really good.  My girlfriend and i each had a different salad.        Very fresh and really good. We split the crab cake appetizers. Fabulous!                       I got the Burger and fries  Burger was great! Very moist ... My girlfriend got the Shrimp Tacos also very good, we were so full by the end of it all. Complementairy  bottled water . We love this place !
3	"""The bf saw a groupon for this and asked me jokingly to call in sick for a day of waterpark fun. I (being the spontaneous person I am) said \let's do it!\"""" I am from California so I have been to my fair share of waterparks growing up. The one's in Cali are a lot bigger with a lot more rides and attractions. I must say I still had a great time coming here. We hit all the slides multiple times, and since it was in the middle of the week it wasn't too crowded. The wave pool is pretty interesting since it consists of one large wave that comes every couple of minutes, not like what I had seen at other waterparks where a number of waves comes periodically. It was also strange to me that we had to pay for rafts, I don't remember ever doing that anywhere else. I also missed my favorite \""""lazy river\"""" that is at every waterpark I've been to. But other than that there is a good time to be had. I don't know if I would go back without a groupon but I recommend giving it a try especially if you have young kids."""""""
4	Amazing view and good food equals a win win. Attended a private dinner here which was about as perfect as they come. However, I didn't see the whole menu as a result. The filet was great, but not nearly as good as enjoying a cigar and some drinks on the patio prior to and after dinner inside. This would be a perfect place to take a date and have a nice glass of wine while taking in the view of the ever sprawling Phoenix area.
3	"""I wouldn't call this a \reflexology\"""" treatment, but more of an Asian foot massage business, similar to nail salons. The atmosphere is very nice, room is dark with comfortable massage chairs. They start by soaking your feet in warm water and massaging your face, head and arms. It's best if you wear shorts and a tshirt. Then they rub your feet for about 30 minutes, and end with a hot towel to wipe off any access lotion. \n\nI have had reflexology before and would not consider this reflexology. It's a nice foot rub for the $25 price, and the automated massage chairs are the best ones I have ever been in. There is a no cell phone policy but I would have liked a no talking policy too. I was very relaxed until a man and woman came in and started talking non stop. It was annoying. \n\nThey charge $35 for an hour but M-Th it's $10 off. The actual foot massage was about 30 minutes. I have been to these places before and expected a little better/firmer massage and am used to a long neck/shoulder massage which I didn't get. It was very clean and staff was very nice. I will go back until I find something that offers a little more massage."""""""
1	"""This is a review of the LIEMAX (IMAX) screen here. It is small, maybe a foot or two bigger than any other theatre here, but not the gigantic IMAX screen you are thinking of.  To paraphrase Obi-Wan, \This is not the IMAX you are looking for...move along\"""" The screen you are looking for is at AZ Mills in Tempe.\n\nThe audio is good...screen is disappointing for what used to be an awesome brand, IMAX. Other than screen size - the projection is awesome (it is actually IMAX film, not the digital thing) so, if you NEED to see something like Beowulf or Avatar in 3D IMAX and can't drive to Tempe (or Westgate for a Real-D presentation), this is your only hope. And it's pretty good. It's just not Old-school IMAX awesomeness.\n\nParking for this theatre SUCKS BIG TIME. Weekends have plenty of cops and security hanging around, if that tells you anything. But, they do have valet...right in front of the box office. I don't know what it costs.\n\nThere are teeny boppers galore. If you are 16 and looking to hang with some \""""cool\"""" kids, this is probably your best bet in the area on a Saturday evening ...if you are an adult trying to enjoy some time off from your kids - head elsewhere."""""""
5	"""Love this place.  I go to do my work during the day (never been there in the eve).  Like others have said the seating is great, atmosphere, vibe--none of the \you're not cool enough to come in this coffee shop\"""" here.  I do miss Keenan, he was the BEST barista......  \n\nElevate has the best espresso in town.  Usually my Americanos have nice crema on top, although like one reviewer said, the counter help is uneven -- my husband asked for an Americano and asked them to be sure there was a lot of crema on the top, and the girl poured a whole bunch of milk in his cup!!  He told her to make him another one (I would have choked it down and been upset).  \n\nDelicious pastries also!!  I've only eaten lunch there once and it was good too.  Can you believe blueberry coleslaw?!  \n\nThe character breakfasts on Tuesday mornings are adorable -- although I did think Dora looked a little creepy this morning with her huge hands, and Elmo was suspiciously quiet...."""""""
3	Oh I hate having to write a review like this, I want to rate it FIVE stars all the way, but I can't. The customer service is up there as the best I can imagine ever experiencing, honestly they set the example for treating their customer perfectly.  The reason why I wasn't happy was the food was not very impressive.  The chicken and waffle app was good, but not that great, also the chicken was raw in two of the chicken strips.  I have to mention our waitress did a great job making sure to apologize and take the charge off the bill because it wasn't edible.  I ordered the meatloaf, my older sis ordered the lamb burger and my younger sis ordered the truffle grilled cheese.  We are the kind that share tastes so we all get a chance to try a few things.  I ended up trading my meal with my older sis because she liked the meatloaf a lot. So she likes meatloaf different than I do I guess, but what I didn't like was the gravy, it wasn't that good.  I liked the lamb burger more, but the meat wasn't seasoned well, it couldn't get a salt hint from it at all, but the topping helped to add flavor, and it was good overall.  The fries were good, but I feel like if In-N-out or five guys makes better fries, they aren't impressing me much... The ketchup was soooo good though, I am not a ketchup eater much (I mix it with mayo for a Utah style fry sauce), but this spiced one was very yummy.  The truffle grilled cheese was again, good, but not great, it also lacked seasoning or any wow factor.  Last the dessert, the apple pie was very good, not the best I have had, but solid apple pie.  The dream pudding cup was not good, it was very griddy, like very very griddy.  I really didn't expect to feel this way, maybe the high expectations set me up for a let down, but really I was just let down...
5	Now I know that most folks who live here have either never heard of this combination or thought of it as some racist stereotype but Lo Lo's serves up the best fried chicken in AZ along with a side of waffles and a cup of syrup like you've never tasted before. The menu is a bit limited in scope featuring dozens of iterations of their featured foods Lo Lo's delivers multiple southern-style sides like grits, rice and gravy, fried okra, collard greens, red beans and rice, fries, mac & cheese, and eggs. Make no mistake, one could easily fill up on side dishes.\n\nYou'll find Lo Lo's (if you're lucky) in the SoJack (I'm inventing terms here for the area south of Jackson) off Central. It is a small house-looking structure with a gated door on it. Inside you will find cramped confines that will have the loud and lively wait staff running around you with dishes and cups no matter where you sit. Don't expect quiet, you won't find it. Don't expect privacy, you left that at home. Come and enjoy the people and the food. It is worth the trip and for the experience. We are lucky to have a place like this. The Southern Kitchen in Tacoma was one of the few authentic Southern food places that I have found outside of the south. To have Lo Lo's bringing some culture to AZ is much appreciated. You will not find this kind of food elsewhere in Phoenix.
4	Shady's is awesome at one thing: getting me drunk and home cheaply. Okay, two things.\n\nNot looking to go far or try hard? Try Shady's.\n\nDon't want to drink at home alone because that makes you feel like an alcoholic? Try Shady's. \n\nWant to hear The Pixies all night long? Try Shady's. (P.S. I have no idea who The Pixies are, but everyone here LOVES them... so they must be good.) \n\nWant to have a one-night-stand? Don't try Shady's. (Try Scottsadle.)\n\nBasically, it's like getting drunk with friends in your grandparent's basement... only you don't have to clean up the mess the next morning.
3	"""After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to try MM. However, tonight was my friends birthday so we all met here for dinner...\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is very \chain like\"""", not really what I was expecting(yes, I do know it's a chain).\nOur server, Ashley, was very nice, and attentive. She didn't let any of our drinks go with out refills, and she split our large table's check for us with out us even having to ask!\nThe food was pretty good. We had the drunken fun guy(?) appetizer and the BBQ chicken pizza. Both were good, not amazing, but good. Everything tasted a little 'processed' or maybe just not very fresh. The crust was good and crisp, but had an almost microwaved texture to it, like it was old...\nI might give them another try, I just don't know if it's really the place for me..."""""""
3	I hate to give this place only 3 stars, because the atmosphere is comfortable and cozy and the staff will remember you from visit to visit, but the quality of the drinks varies too much for my liking. There is wi-fi, tables inside and out and, even computers available for customer use. This place is never too busy and service is fast.\n\nBUT.......My first time in gave me 5 star service and 2 star bubble tea (which btw comes in a smoothie form, different from traditional bubble tea). I prefer to frequent local establishments, so I gave it another go the following week. I had a wonderful espresso in a serene environment , and ended up studying peacefully for about 3 hours. The homey, comfortable couch called me back this past weekend for another study sessions, but I ended up disappointed with an Americano that was too watered down. I think the quality of the drink is dependent on the server, which is sad because this place is sooooo close to me. Give it a try, but be sure to let me know how your drink was, please! May the coffee God's be watching over you on your visit, amen.
4	"""We had the Spring Mix Salad with Roasted Asparagus, Tomato Basil pizza, Four Cheese Ravioli, and Alfredo Classic.\n\nThe salad was one of the best salads I've ever had. The ingredients all went together perfectly. The smokey, roasted flavor of the asparagus, the sweetness from the raisins and dressing, the variety of flavors in the spring mix - it was absolutely perfect! The menu says it's served with a \sweet vinaigrette,\"""" but I'd describe it more as a balsamic reduction (I'm not crazy about typical vinaigrettes, but I love a good balsamic reduction); it was thicker and less oily than what I think of as a salad vinaigrette. \n\nThe pizza was very good, but not amazing. I'm not sure how I feel about the halved cherry tomatoes as a topping, they felt a little large compared to the other toppings. I'm a little more used to sliced tomatoes. The crust had a great flavor and texture. It was not overly greasy. \n\nThe Four Cheese Ravioli was excellent. The pink sauce was a little more red than cream and was delicious. The cheese in the ravioli (predominantly ricotta) had a great flavor as well. The raviolis were cooked well (unlike the fettuccini). \n\nUnfortunately, the fettuccini noodles in the Alfredo Classic were pretty terribly undercooked (you can actually see how undercooked they are in the picture I posted). The sauce had a nice flavor, albeit a bit too mild. There was a hint of possibly white wine, which was nice; however, it did not have much of a cheese flavor and no garlic at all. It definitely needed the extra parmesan at the table. It's hard to say how the dish would be if the noodles had been cooked properly. I think I'd suggest sticking to their pink sauce or maybe the penne with veggies and the cream sauce to jazz it up a bit.\n\nThey also served a nice rosemary flavored bread at the table. \n\nThe service was very friendly. However, it took a while for someone to come back after our meals were delivered. I had to wait quite some time to get some grated parmesan on the Alfredo (i.e. we'd pretty much finished every other entr\u00e9e by then). \n\nThe prices were very reasonable and the portions were on the large side overall. As other reviewers mentioned, it was quite dead inside. I think if it weren't for the great prices and salad, I'd give the place 3 stars, but it's worth a trip for the salad alone! And it shows that they do have a creative mind back there and a lot of potential. They just need to work on execution of all the dishes."""""""
3	Last night after developing a huge craving for Panang Chicken and browsing Yelp for a good place nearby, I decided to call Papaya. The guy who answered the phone said that due to a downed gas line in the area they couldn't operate, but their Mesa store would deliver to me for no extra charge since I couldn't come pick it up like I wanted to. I said this would be fine, placed my order, and the guy said it would be about 45 minutes. An hour and 15 minutes later the food still hadn't arrived, but I figured it was just because it was coming from Mesa. \n\nWhen it finally arrived, I was starving, so I opened the food immediately, only to find out that my Panang CHICKEN was nothing but sauce and a few carrots and bell peppers. On top of this, I had been charged a delivery fee when they said I wouldn't, and I was charged for chicken when I got none. I called back immediately to tell them my food did not have any chicken in it, but was only sauce and a couple vegetables. They informed me that they were very busy and would not be able to bring me another order that night, but I could call back the next day (today) and they would bring me another order. I was upset and hoped that for all the trouble the food was at least good. Well, it was. The panang sauce was very delicious and perfectly spicy. Although it was not made the way I ordered it, I could still tell that it was very good and I would definitely order it again. \n\nToday, I called back and they brought me a new order, this time of Spicy Eggplant with chicken since I had already had to eat the panang I ended up with last night and didn't want that again at this point. They were very nice about making it right, and they delivered it to me again at no charge and credited back the charge they made last night. Delivery took about an hour and 15 minutes again even though he had said 45 and this location is about a mile from where I live, so if you order delivery expect a bit of a wait. As for the Spicy Eggplant with chicken, it was REALLY delicious. The eggplant tasted like some of the best I've ever had, not mushy but not firm, and I finally got my chicken and yes, it was very good. SO in conclusion, the food is great but I hope that they are more organized when they aren't having technical difficulties. Probably won't have them deliver again but I would definitely order from here again. If there hadn't been all the problems I would give them 4 stars but the fact that I couldn't even get my order corrected that night was upsetting.
5	After the husband, my friend, and I had finished at Paws in the Park with our dogs on Saturday, we headed over to Hula's to check out how pet friendly their patio was. We found a nice shaded table in the corner and it wasn't long until someone came by with waters for us and a dog bowl with water and ice for my Australian kelpie and my friend's long haired chihuahua. Awesome! \n\nOnce we had chilled with some $2 mimosas, we ordered lunch. Holy cow, that Hula burger with cheddar was just what I needed after a long morning of playing with my pup. My friend got the side mac and cheese as her meal and was very surprised. As an avid mac and cheese girl, she said it was comparable to the one at The Capital Grille (without the lobster, obviously). Deeelish! Husband also enjoyed his Hula burger with side of mac and cheese, but mostly his Dr. Funk, despite the ladylike color. Looking at their weekday happy hour menu, I wouldn't mind coming back just for a drink and a basket of their crispy sweet potato fries.
3	I've been going to the Tempe location for quite some time now and just recently made my way to the north location. \n\nWhen I first walked in I was impressed with the amount of seating, but then the smell hit me. What is up with the overwhelming sewer smell? No one wants to eat in a place that smells like a sewer.. So we ordered and took refuge on the outside patio. The breakfast burritos were ok, not amazing but better than bertos. Sometimes the service can be a bit slow and when people don't clean up after themselves the place gets pretty messy. \n\nI would recommend the veggie burro, great fresh pico and big chunks of avocado. I would however order it to go.
5	I spent a great deal of time looking for places myself and my girlfriends would enjoy for our winter escape to Phoenix from Minnesota.   \n\nI found out about Postino and had to try it.  SO glad I did!  Enjoyed the eclectic atmosphere and the great adjectives my server used to describe the wine.  \n\nI had the pick two  - prociutto/brie panini with a side of roasted pepper/gorganzola soup.   All to die for!   The ladies at the next table ordered the mix of baguette with different toppings.. looked amazing.  \n\nI was there for happy hour and sat on the patio.  I love the atmosphere, very comfortable and non-pretentious.   Very good value.  My bill after eating and having two glasses of wine at happy hour was $21.  \n\nMy girlfriends arrive tomorrow.  Postino is a definite stop.   Love it!
3	"""Okay, so I finally went to P.F. Chang's and I'd have to say it was alright.  We went there for a work function so the bill was not something I had to worry about!  Which was uber nice because I tried a few things that I normally wouldn't buy myself. So here is a run down of what I had:\n\nAppetizer: Tuna Tataki Crisp $9.95 *****\n~ This was very good! I am a sushi fanatic, so I really enjoyed this dish. It was Ahi tuna rare on a crispy wonton-topped with ahi, cucumber, and scallions in a citrus sesame soy sauce. It was very fresh! I feel it could have used a tad more on the citrus sesame soy sauce but other than that, fabulous!\n\nAppetizer: Lettuce Wraps $7.95 *\n~  I can honestly say that these wraps were not what I expected.  With all the hype I thought these were gonna blow my taste buds to smithereens! They did no such thing.  They were \okay\"""" at best.  Not a lot of flavor in the meat filling at all. Will not be getting these again.\n\nDinner: Oolong Marinated Chilean Sea Bass $24.95 ****\n~  This FISH was amazing! It was served in a ginger soy type broth with spinach.  While the fish was extraordinary, I felt there was way too much broth and it just made my spinach way to soggy and a bit on the salty side.  It would have been a 5 star dish with less of the broth.\n\nDesert: Mudslide Cocktail $9.00 *****\n~ This deserved 5 stars! It was very yummy and it's alcohol! Win win! \n\nWhile I enjoy the food, I felt it to be a bit over priced.  The wait staff was super nice and you never had to \""""search\"""" for anyone.  Would I go here again? If it were another work function, yes.  Otherwise, probably not."""""""
3	I like this target.  It is in a good location, it is clean and the people are friendly here.  The reason I am giving it only 3 stars is because they do not have as big of a selection than other targets. On a positive it is at the scottsdale pavilions which is much safer than other target locations, much cleaner than other target locations and MUCH LESS CROWED they other target locations.  They don't have a Starbucks in this location, but there is one across the street.
5	"""I've never been to Distrito at night, but recently I had the $15 lunch which comes with two courses, or tapas. I ordered the tortilla soup and the strip steak tacos. The flavors were amazing; really outstanding, quality ingredients. The portion size was a little small, but this is understandable because it is supposedly a \tapas\"""" restaurant. If you're really hungry, I would recommend ordering an additional appetizer. \n\nI noticed that Distrito had churros on their dinner menu but not on their lunch menu. I asked if I could order them anyway and they were very obliging. I'm so happy I asked, they were PERFECT. Soft in the center, and accompanied by two different delicious dipping sauces. I will return for the churros, if nothing (or everything!) else."""""""
3	Cmon is that all you got?\n\nI've been searching Phoenix for months for a Cajun place close by so I could save the gas from driving to pappa's. Ordered the shrimp \u00e9touff\u00e9e and wasn't impressed. And I lived in Kenner la for awhile so me and Cajun have met. \n\nService was great. Lady hooked me up w an extra side of bread... even tho my fat ass could have used a walk to la fitness. \n\nRecommendations: po boys, garlic bread, Bo dang balls. Looking forward to giving them a second chance sometime soon.
3	I know everyone has raved about this place. So naturally, I was was super excited to try it. I don't know if it was just so hyped up or what, but it just seemed like a normal pizza to me... with a really long wait.\n\nI was meeting some girlfriends there for lunch, we got there a few minutes early and asked to be seated, but they won't seat you until the whole party is there, unfortunately (although understandable!). So we stood outside, in the 108 degree heat until everyone got there. After waiting over an hour, they finally were able to seat us. We had three kiddos with us, and they told us they only had two high chairs. (Not a huge issue, but definitely not convenient either.)\n\nI thought their menu was extremely limited, only have 6 pizzas: 3 with red sauce and 3 with white sauce and then just a few toppings you could add.\n\nWhile the food was alright, I didn't find it over-the-top or spectacular as I had expected. Needless to say, I'd have no problem going back but I probably wouldn't seek it out.
4	Had a delicious pizza here with my husband tonight....tried a half and half of BBQ chicken and vegetarian on a whole grain thick base. We really enjoyed it. We were also happy to find out that they are now an organic restaurant.  We thought they were a new restaurant as we had never been there before but apparently they have been at this location for quite a few years now and just changed their name and ingredients. Their salads and pastas also look very tasty and for a decent price. We will definitely be back.
3	As I've mentioned in many of my other reviews, I'm not a big salad person. I almost always choose a sandwich, soup or entree over a salad, even for lunch. Given that, I always appreciate a salad that has some substance to it--if there are hearty ingredients paired with the lettuce and/or there are generous portions of these mix-ins, I'm likely to be a fan (even if I'd still order a sandwich nine times out of ten!). \n\nThe seafood cake salad I had at Taylor's definitely met my standards for a good salad. There were a ton of greens and the seafood cakes that came on top of the salad were both flavorful and well-sized. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when the salad protein is such a small portion that you have to carefully meter out enough bites to last through the whole salad. I don't know about you, but at lunch, I want to eat not think. Agree with other reviewers that the salads at Taylor's are pricey but this is logical given their size. \n\nOne thing I was really unenthusiastic about at Taylor's? The incredibly chilly and relatively unattentive service. I don't need a bubbly server who is constantly in my face or spewing out niceties, but I wouldn't mind someone who at least pretends to give a rat's ass about the job (or if they can't muster that, at least gets me what I need when I need it). \n\nIf you want a big and tasty salad, check out Taylor's--but don't go expecting friendly service.
4	Finally decided to give it a try as we were in the area on a Tuesday.  We arrived about 4:40 with the kids and made the first seating at the bar.  People waiting in line were all super nice.\n\nWe started with antipasta for my daughter who has to eat gluten free.  It was very good different than usual with roasted pepers, squash, etc.  She also tired the tomatoes with mozzarella which she liked.\n\nWe tried the Margherita which we loved.  We thought the Wise Guy pizza, a white pizza was over powering with flavor and thin crust.  We would order the Margherita again next time.
5	Praise be to Amber W. \n\nI was a thai food beginner, then she introduced yuphas. That was my whole world--then she told me about thai elephant. My belief after eating at yuphas was that fried rice could be executed no more skillfully than yupha her(him?)self did it. But thai elephant has kicked it up yet another notch. \n\nI get the drunken fried rice, add egg, which includes typical fried rice but adds jalapeno and probably something else I'm forgetting. It delivers a savory and delectable punch that leaves me reeling with delight. By the time I get back to work, I feel a sensation that only the most brain-nullifying postcoital stupor could deliver. \n\nNow I have had a crappy day but that feeling gnawing at my insides is a longing, a *desperation* for thai elephant and the thrills that that only drunken fried rice can impart. Drunken, indeed, for I am in love.
3	Woo-hoo! First to review! Well, recently tried this place on my break and it wasn't bad. I'd give it more of a 3.5. I can only comment on the To Go food cause that's all I had time for. I had the carnitas burrito. And it was tasty and quite hefty, but I'd expect that at the prices their burritos are going for. At first taste, I found it a bit odd. I think maybe they buttered their tortillas cause there was a queer taste that I don't find from other burrito places. The filling was good; the pork was yummy and not dry or stringy. I'll probably go back and try more of their menu some time.
3	"""---- Update ----\nOkay so me and a buddy went back to Pirate's yesterday and I have to say, I am saddened.  They have changed suppliers, and now the versions of their items are horrible.  The shrimp are just regular frozen jumbo shrimp, not the big globs of battered goodness as before.  Their scallops are about as big as my thumbnail and they looked horrible.  The fish is a square processed patty and the fries are skinny and cheap.\nThey even hired a second employee.  A lady who is not only rude, but smug while she is laying into you about how the tartar sauce doesn't come with your fish.  NO TARTAR SAUCE?!?!?! Its a fish and chips place!!!! In the end, we had to 'trade' (YES I SAID TRADE!) our Pete's, oops i mean Pirate's sauce for tartar sauce!  WHAT A JIP!\n\nI am removing a star for this horrendous \make over\"""". Because hey, if you're gonna change something, change the damn tables!\n\n---- First Review ----\nWhat can I say about Pirates Fish and Chips?  Well there are some good things and bad things (mostly good).  You could EASILY compare this to any number of fish and chip 'shacks' around the Phoenix valley, but this one definitely stands out.  \n\nIt stands out mostly because of its cleanliness (compared to other shacks) and the food itself.  I have been to the location on Warner and Gilbert twice now and both times it was clean, and the service was fast.  Everything on the menu is frozen, mind you, but it comes in large portions.  The service is great, they will actually bring it out to you even if you are sitting outside!  The food has been super hot (almost too hot) both times, so be careful when biting into those delicious crabby patties!\n\nOn the downside, the plastic tables are an eyesore, and should be wiped down more often.  They really don't fit well with the decor (Mural, flatscreens, etc..) and I wouldn't bring anyone to this place to impress them (solely because of the tables)"""""""
4	3.5 stars. New York style deli very much like Miracle Mile, except family owned and just done better. \n\nIngredients and preparation match authentic NY delis for me. However, my friend who has had more experience going to such places in NY says its lacking. I think he's just suffering from a nostalgia complex, I don't know how you could make a Straw sandwich any better. Although, technically the family who runs it are New Hampshire/Massachusetts transplants. \n\nThey also supposedly have the best hot dogs. I have seen them and they are extremely large and impressive looking. I don't eat hot dogs, but I'm guessing they are awesome since I have eaten their sauerkraut which is money.\n\nGets the bump to four stars for having some cool photographs of Phoenix architecture through the centuries.
5	I couldn't believe how great this location was.  Having been to a few of the Cartel locations in other places in the city as well as having their espresso as guest coffees at other cafes around the country, I never imagined I would get a great shot at an airport, no matter what the brand name on the sign. But boy oh boy was I wrong.  This place had great service, an innovative customer service set up, and fantastic baristas that performed as well as their other locations.  I couldn't have been more surprised.  This was an absolutely fantastic thing to have in an airport, and it makes me want to connect through Phoenix on Southwest (they are in the southwest terminal) if i absolutely HAVE to connect.\n\nA hidden gem.
4	"""Canal has been a stop on many a \bar tour\"""" through the Waterfront / Old Town area. The bar always has a good crowd in the evenings and the patio is fantastic on warm nights. With summer finally clearing out and it now being possible to sit outside during the daylight hours, we made our way to Canal for some late lunch / day drinking on a recent Sunday.\n\nFirst off, what a great place to sit and people watch!  This was the first time we had ever ordered food at Canal, so we were interested to see if the cuisine lived up to the hip decor and vibe of the restaurant. The baby burgers (3 of them) were served up on an \""""English High Tea\"""" tray. Great presentation, and the actual taste of those little guys didn't disappoint.....ahi tuna / fillet mignon / ground chicken. The fillet was my favorite. What can I say? I like red meat!\n\nWe also had the fish tacos.....delicious! A great experience, all around. We're definitely looking forward to getting back here for dinner soon."""""""
5	This place is just AWESOME! We found it by accident and are extremely glad we did. Following an hour long Massage in the same Plaza we went inside Mekong Plaza, an indoor shopping center catering to Asian restaurants, market and other retail stores. We found Mekong Palace and had a GREAT meal! 2.5 pound lobster (from their tank) with ginger and scallions, fresh oysters in black bean sauce, Gai Lan, rice, tea and dessert for $40.00!! The service was great and we were made to feel at home. We went back the next day for Dim Sum and again, we were thrilled with EVERYTHING!
4	I love wine and trying a bunch of different wines. I have seen Kokopelli wines in Sedona and wanted to try them so I was highly enthused to see they were within a couple miles of my house!\n\nSo I'm going to be honest... since shaving my head, I test people's ability to not judge a book by its cover, especially when I'm a customer.  I watch carefully how I am treated to see if there is any change that's different from what I was normally get with my longer hair.\n\nThis place was NO ISSUE at all.  I could have walked in with purple skin for all they cared.  That was a plus right up front.\n\nWe were seated promptly on a Thursday night to some really nice live music.  He was enjoyable, talking with the other patrons and with us.  His music was excellent to listen to while eating also, not too loud or anything.\n\nWaitress was fine... she was attentive, no issues with her.\n\nWe ordered the crab and artichoke appetizer and it clearly wasn't what I expected.  It actually had a texture and taste of an excellent chunky soup that I could have had, rather than a dip.  It was slightly bland but good, just totally against what I expected that it kinda threw me off. \n\nI was hoping my food wouldn't turn out like that.\n\nI had the pasta Danielle which was very good, although again slightly bland.  Had the spice it needed, but didn't have taste behind it.\n\nThe key here... add salt.  I hate adding salt as typically most dishes have enough to begin with, but these clearly didn't.  As soon as I added salt, it was great.\n\nThe wines are awesome... love the Sweet Lucy, which is a sweet red.  I also had the Merlot which is awesome also.  I'm not one for Chianti's, but my partner had a Chianti and it was better than some german chianti's I've tried.\n\nThe decor of wine barrels on the wall is nice and comfortable, a bar in the center of everything with a tv which appeared to have a good selection of alcohol.\n\nThere was a good number of people in there for a Thursday night, which surprised me.  Most of the patrons were of senior age, which may explain the food.\n\nI will go back though to try some more.
4	Yard House is awesome. It is my go-to place in Westgate for some good beer and delicious food. I always attempt to try at least one new beer when I come here, but am usually drawn back to my usual Hoegaarden.\n\nTo start, I like the onion ring tower. As far as entree's go.. take your pick. Everything I've had was very good: the enchilada stack, seared scallops and porcini-crusted halibut. My favorite being the scallops.. the truffle sauce was amazing, the orzo and scallops were cooked to perfection, and everything just went really well together. The entrees can be pricey,  but the portions are large and I've never left feeling dissatisfied.
2	"""Wow, Monkey Pants, you really let me down.  I've heard so many great things, from Yelp and from friends, and I couldn't wait to check this place out.  I finally did, and was honestly very surprised at how much I didn't like this place.\n\nSo the basics... you can usually get 2 out of 3 on service, price, and quality.  Well the service sucked.  The waitress was literally angry we were there.  The prices were ok.  Quality?  When your coke doesn't taste like coke (we're talking about soda here), the lemonade doesn't taste like lemonade, and the nachos seem like they've been prepared a few hours ago... not my place.\n\nThe decor confused me.  It seemed like they wanted to try for a sports restaurant, with a ton of TVs, but the TVs were fighting with the grandma's living room section.  I didn't feel the vibe, in fact I felt the desire to go home.\n\nThey have a free comedy show on Thursday nights as well.  The MC kept reminding us that you get what you pay for, but he must have been lying because they didn't pay me to sit through it.  Just about nothing offends me, but these \comedians\"""" had offense on lock.  Jokes about rape and abortion, one after another, and nobody was laughing - time to give it up."""""""
5	PV OB-Gyn is great! My vagina and uterus have received wonderful care over the years by Dr. Dado, Laura Waggener NP, and Margarett Gossett NP (I get around, hehe). Their professionalism and friendly bedside manner make the awkward positioning and nakedness of our meetings a little more comfortable. The ancillary staff is just as friendly and professional. The office itself is new and very modern. The waiting area is beautiful with plenty of spacious seating and a coffee station to visit while you wait. \n\nThe exam rooms have a huge TV in it that you can navigate yourself and learn about any OB or Gyn issue you may have or might just be curious about. Also, I love the fact that you don't have to feel any pressure when you get changed. When you are ready, all you have to do is push the green button and it lets your care provider know you are ready for them to come in.
5	I LOVE this place!  It is located in a very unassuming shopping center.  When I first walked in I was extremely impressed by the d\u00e9cor.  It is super clean and there is nothing tacky about the place.  It's beautiful!  Ben, the owner I believe, is so funny and very friendly.  He always chats with customers and jokes around, really nice!  It is very different from all other nail salons that I have been to.  I feel like you are getting a manicure or pedicure at a fancy salon for the price of one at your normal run-of-the-mill places.  My pedicure always last a really long time! \n\nThey accept credit card, but make sure to bring cash for tip! \n\nI've been about 5+ times, and won't go anywhere else from now on!
4	My sister passed along a free movie pass so the hubby and I went yesterday. This place is really nice! I'm not much of a drinker, but the bar was impressive. \n\nWe were the first of 6 people to arrive for the afternoon showing of The Immortals. The movie was nothing to write home about, however the theater is. The seats are roomy and comfy with a tray for food that slides back & forth. It would have been nice if the seats reclined more. I ordered the popcorn which was buttery, salty and yummmmmy:) \n\nI took 1 star away because the volume was crazy-loud. I anticipate the volume being loud which is why I always bring earphones to the movie. It was still so loud that I couldn't hear the sarcastic comments I was making in my head about Micky Rouke.
4	I was so sad when I thought this old gem had closed down! Then so happy it had just moved.. and closer!\n\nI don't find this building as charming as the old location, but they did bring everything along that was there and set it up in a fun way. \nService is ultra friendly. The place is clean and has nice high ceilings. There is a patio out front, parking in the back. \n\nIt's a little difficult for me to rate the food, since there really are no Vegetarian options. They made me a grilled cheese upon request that was good. The entrees and smells here do seem really great. The food always looks quality. Yes, it is expensive, but I think the higher end cuts and reputation justify that in my opinion. \n\nThey have happy hour with good specials and a cute sit up bar. \nOverall a couple of great experiences. Not my highest recommendation for Vegetarians at ALL, but I wouldn't really expect this to be a real veggie-like place. My husband absolutely loved both of his meals (steak and burger).
4	"""As far as what Phoenix has to offer, this is definitely the best comic book store to go to. This location in particular is the best one in the valley.\n\nI've been frequenting here since I was in the fifth grade and I've yet to be disappointed. What's great about this place is that they have all the current issues available as well as a strong collection of back issues. They're also pretty good about maintaining a solid manga section as well.  Another reason worth stopping by is their \indie\"""" selection ala Jhonen Vasquez, Charles Burns, Clowes, etc..\n\nIf you can't find it here, they'll order it for you so you won't lose any more sleep about what Superman said to Wonder Woman in that one issue of Red Son or whether you can find that favorite issue of Toyfare that you lost in junior high.\n\nIf you're looking for a crash course in geekdom, you'll find everything and more here. The staff is pretty knowledgeable and friendly if you're looking for something in particular or even if you're just wondering what's good to read. This place is definitely a staple of Phoenix and isn't leaving anytime soon."""""""
4	A great value for a clean car; this is a no frills place.\n\nThere's no  line of people waiting to clean, wax, and polish your car; as such, no one trying to up sell you a new wind shield or $100 detailing service. The employees simply ask what you would like and send you on through the wash. \n\n**Note, if you have an older vehicle with a metal antenna, be sure to detach it before entering the wash.**\n\nI used to get the $2 wash until I decided to step up to the $5 wash last week. I was plesantly surprised when I saw my wheels were clean when I bent down to wipe them off - this you don't get with the $2 wash. \n\nThey have free vacuum stations for all their customers. If your willing to spend a few extra min doing the vacuuming and wiping down your dash yourself, you get just as good of a wash or better than the full service car washes that you spend $20 on.\n\nTheres usually no (or a very short) line of people waiting to wash their car. In general, you're in and out within 15 - 20 minutes.
4	i've had a membership to massage envy for the past 3-4 years.  When I lived on the west side of town i would go to the one in arrowhead, surprise, and litchfield park locations.  I now regulary go to the moon valley location because i have moved East of the 51.  \n\nI'm a fan of deep tissue and i'm very picky about getting massages.  Many years ago, I completed the massage training program at Massage School of Santa Monica.  It's hit and miss.  Once you find a therapist that is good then you need to stick with them.  At the moon valley location i usually book appts with Gary, Lydia, David, or Javier.  Lydia does really good deep tissue.  And she addresses all the issues i have.  \n\nMy philosophy on resorts and local massage centers is that at the resorts the therapist does not depend on repeat customers.  Many of the clients are resort guests and they receive gift cards for the spa as part of a package or many times when guests are there as part of a work convention etc.  they will receive gift cards to use.   I feel that at local massage centers they depend on repeat business so the therapist makes sure they address all your concerns.  I have never had a great massage at a resort.
4	Total Tempe staple. And so it should be. I went on a very hot Sunday afternoon and although the wait was ridic we sat at the bar and drank mimosas. I thought $4 was a decent price until I saw the glass she served them in. Pretty small, so I was disappointed. \n\nDisappointed left the building, folks, when I got my food. Starving for a good burger I was amazed at  good it was. The blue cheese was crumbly the way I like it. My roommate got the Jalepeno burger and was raving!\n\nI recommend going on a week night or early lunch. Gets pretty packed around noon lunchtime and the wait can be not so great.
5	I absolutely loved my experience working with Alphagraphics. My task required I have 1000 flyers produced and ready for display the following day. I called the Alphagraphics located on Scottsdale Road in Old Town, after fruitlessly researching the Kinko's online options, expecting to be quoted with an outrageous price that would likely include some form of artistic fee. I was relieved to find the exact opposite. I spoke with someone directly over the phone, told them what I needed, how I wanted them printed, and described the paper style/texture I was looking for. They quoted a price for me immediately and I was shocked how low it was, especially compared to all the prices I was seeing on Kinko's site. I told them I would call them right back to run the price by my boss and as soon as I got off the phone, I thought to myself that the price couldn't be right and I must have forgotten to mention something. I called back to ensure they heard me say I wanted it in COLOR, and if the price included cutting. And sure enough they were both included in my original price. They produced a draft for me to double check first then had them all printed in two hours! I was very please with the quality and efficiency. \n\nI would recommend this location to anyone looking for a quick easy printing solution.
3	This place is basically a low rent TCBY. Its good for what it is. The place is small and was pretty filthy when we went. It gets crowded really easily.  They do not have a great selection on toppings and every time I have gone my cup has been handed to me messy and dripping. It seems like they can not keep the toppings in the cup. As taste goes, it is fine. Nothing special. I would go back but there are so many other places I would go before Golden Spoon.
2	"""It is a cafeteria, I say this with all of the negative conotation that comes with that phrase.\n\nLocated in the beautiful Viad tower (former dial building) on the 2nd floor is this dimly lit cafeteria.\n\nThere are several stations including a sandwich station, grill, \world\"""" and salad stations. At each station there is a small illegible at a distance sign of what is available.\n\nMost food is made to order, which is problematic as I had to stand in line for over 10 min with a tray to get my meal, then there was another line to check out.\n\nI ordered the salmon, which is not on the menu but the raw fish was on display. \n\nI ordered the fish and it was slapped on the griddle with a generous amount of clarified butter, there goes the healthy idea. Th fish was over cooked. As a side I selected a grilled vegetable salad that was ok but lacked flavor. The combo was about $6 with out a drink which seemed steep for a cafeteria.\n\nThe one nice thing is the fact there are several condiments at the exit, including buffalo sauce which was nice.  The sitting area is clean and nice.\n\nOnly eat here if you are stuck in this building and pressed for time."""""""
2	Disclaimer: If you're bringing a date here for drinks, it's perfect.  Swag atmosphere, strong drinks, trendy.  My review is based solely on dinner.\n\nThe waffle fries that everyone is raving about are not that great.  They're not bad, but not worth a mention in a review.  I ordered the Burger Au Poivre II, and I still don't know what it tasted like because of all the pepper they used to cook it.  I would honestly rather order a Big Mac at McDonald's.  Also had the Hell's Fire Chips, and they're basically potato chips with hot sauce (which is also on the table as a condiment) on them.  It's sad to say, but the best thing I ate there was the cobb salad, and that was not even anything to rave about.\n\nI would rate this one star, but I had a pleasant experience with friends, and the servers were friendly.  That's deserving of another star.
5	LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!\nMoved to Phoenix from Seattle for school and this was the only place I felt I could really kick back and relax. Reminded me of a few of my favorite spots back home on The Hill.\n\nPros:\n\n-Yummy Seafood selection.\n\n-Plenty of choices for people of all food preferences- meat lovers, pescatarians, vegans, etc.\nI'd recommend the Caim Chowder, the Hippie Sandwich (YUM!), and the Hummus platter is a great share along with the Calamari. In Arizona good quality Calamari has proved to be hard to come by, but not here!\n\n- My favorite characteristic about this place is the resident kitty that you can find lounging around no matter the size of the crowd :)\n\n- One of the most diverse crowds of people i've seen at one place in Arizona.\n\n- Friendly people and staff; if ever a busy night people will gladly share a table with you. Always made a new friend :)\n\nCons:\n\n-Staff can be a bit impatient with placing orders and at times I've had to go up to the bar from my table to order drinks because the waiter didn't come by and check up for over 20mins...\n\nOther than that, its a great place to go if you want to meet some kick ass people and avoid the drama of mill and sky rocket prices of old town.
4	To add to what many other Yelpers said: you really can't tell what is Richardson's and what is Rokerij; the free valet is very convenient, especially considering there is basically no lot; it is extremely dark inside, so don't plan on enjoying the appearance of your food; and MAKE A RESERVATION if you want to eat in Richardson's.\n\nThat being said, we had very good service - not super attentive, but I much prefer when servers don't spend a lot of time hovering.  All our meals were correct and everything was prompt but not rushed.  We went on a Tuesday, which happens to be half price bottles of wine night, so that was a great surprise.\n\nI ordered the Posole to start.  It was VERY spicy but delicious.  We also had the chips and guacomole, with the 3 different salsas, and that was wonderful to start.\n\nMy husband ordered the enchilada platter and his father ordered the New Mexico platter.  They both loved their food, although it was alsy very spicy (the particular green chiles in their sauce were very spicy at least).  \n\nMy mother-in-law had the skewers and it was fine.\n\nI had the Pasta Heidi: green chili pasta with chicken and a chipotle cream sauce.  I literally could have died right then and been satisfied.  It was SO.  GOOD.  We literally can't wait to go back just so we can have the Pasta Heidi again.  My mouth is watering.  YUM.  \n\nI would also recommend checking out the basement bar, just to have a drink.  Have your server or a hostess show you how to get down there.  It's pretty cool, and a nice place to spend some time while you wait for your table.
4	"""Oh what a night! Took my date here back on June 13. It was a very special time for me, as I remember what a night.\n\nThe lady and I came in on a Wednesday evening and were promptly greeted by the hostess. She asked if we'd like to be seated at a table or in their piano bar; it was open seating. Delighted to hear that we could enjoy our dinner with a little live piano, I opted to check out the bar. \n\nOh I, got a funny feeling when we walked in the room. And I, as I recall it ended much too soon. Miffed at having to wait 15 minutes now with no waiter stopping by, we went back to the hostess and asked if we could sit somewhere that had actual wait staff to take our orders. After a quick and sincere apology from the hostess and who I believe to have been the manager, they said they would seat us with their best waitress! They too seemed; or at least acted, genuinely concerned that we had to wait so long. \n\nHypnotizing, mesmerizing me. She was everything I dreamed she'd be. Within moments of being seated; for real this time, our waitress had our drink orders and was describing the specials of the day.  We ordered up a bowl of (so-so) chicken tortilla soup.Then went on to a (super fantastic) artichoke / goat cheese flat bread!\n\nThe Summer Vegetarian Tasting Salad was out-a-sight, it came with one an awesome tasting taco and it was all veggie! The wife loved the chili relleno, and I found the cedar roasted tofu with mango chutney to be top notch. The \grains of life\"""" as they are listed on the menu was one of the better versions of quinoa I've been served in the valley; light refreshing and one of the best protein sources you can find in the veggie kingdom.\n\nAlong with our vegetarian sampler, we shared an order of Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin; and oh was it tender. Served up with an amazing creamy herb polenta and one or two other vegetables, this meal was 100% delish.\n\nOh what a night, this meal was turning out to be. Sweet Surrender, what a night! They served me up a few of those Mini Indulgence Desserts. \""""Yes, I'll have two desserts.\"""" Why not, they're only a couple bucks!\n\nThanks seasons 52 for turning around an unimpressive start and taking care of what could have been an ugly experience, you guys certainly saved the evening!\n\nI felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder, Straining my head around and taking my body under. O what a night! After a meal like this I'll be singing that famous Four Seasons song for a days to come. OH what a night! Doo dit doo dit dit, doo dit doo dit dit. Oh what a night!..."""""""
2	Hmph... I had always wanted to try this spot, and living within walking distance for the past 3 years hasn't done much to change that, until now.  After catching a show at the Herberger, Ashley A. suggested we go here for drinks/food.  I wasn't really feeling it because I was scared of what I expected in terms of premium pricing, but we went anyway.  The elevator ride up was fun and it made my ears pop.  Once we got off the elevator though, things kind of stopped being fun and I felt like I just stepped into a closet.  It was so dark!\n\nI will give the Compass one thing, their service is fantastic.  Unfortunately, service does not make up for the lack of quality in food or the overwhelmingly inflated prices.  They didn't have Coke, which really irritated me, so I just had a water.  We ended up getting the Drunken Shrimp app since we weren't entirely hungry and then the Lava Cake for dessert.  The sauce with the shrimp was startlingly salty.  Even for me, and I oversalt everything.  The shrimp were okay, and there were only three.  Seriously?  20 bucks for 3 shrimp and a piece of bread.  Sheesh!  At least the desserts were priced fairly.  The lava cake was okay, but it doesn't even come close to my beloved Domino's Lava Crunch Cake.  \n\nAfter checking out the rather uninspired menu and it's awe inspiring prices, I won't be back.  Besides, the view from the top of the Chase Tower is much more impressive, so the view alone will not get me to come back.
5	"""I just had the most amazing breakfast...I'm so excited about this place I am typing up this review as I finish my meal.  My husband and I have recently gone \organic\"""" so we have been looking for a breakfast place that catered to this type of clientele.  I had the Hawaiian breakfast that included fried eggs,  fresh roasted pork, cabbage, jasmine rice, fried wontons and a drizzle of soy sauce.  Delish!  I've eaten food in Hawaii and this is exactly what it tastes like!  My husband had the Monte Cristo with strawberry jam at the bottom and if I wasn't soo full from my own meal I'd finish his.  The food came out fast and hot.\n\nI'm contemplating staying here until lunch and eating lunch too, but they may get sick of me so I'll try lunch another day.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for delicious food.  We sat on the patio, which made the experience that much more enjoyable.  If I could choose 6 stars...I would."""""""
4	Second burger joint I tried recently as a new transplant to the valley.  Went about 4:00pm ish for a late lunch and it was dead. A guy came right up from the back and was helpful with the menu and then grilled up my burger in front of me. Decent sourdough burger.But for the price, I expected more  taste from a bolder sauce, generous veggies, or better quality beef. I think I paid towards $7. Fries were great though. If you like potato wedges you will like these fries--they're thick cut and seasoned. I would go back again just for some fries and to try a shake with it.
4	"""Some of the best Chinese food we have found in the Chandler/Gilbert area. This place is a little drive for us but we make the trip. Much larger portions compared to PF Changs. Better value also. I'm not sure it is \gourmet\"""" , mainly standard chinese-american dishes. They do have some good stuff though. Fairly large menu.\nWe like the egg rolls but not the spring rolls.

1	Luckily, I bought a Groupon and it was only $10 for the two of us.  When parking found out it was another $5.  Once we got in at 12:30pm after a 1/2 of trying to park,  we decided to divide and conquer and both of us stood in line for 2 hours.  Emerson Fry bread, looked good however lacked any seasonings, so very bland for the Carne Asate Fry bread $7.  Luckily, Montana BBQ for a $15 plate, was tasty and I put extra BBQ on my plate so we also put it on the Fry Bread too.  1 person was designated for each Beverage station so even getting a drink was soooo slow.  I heard 12 food trucks ran out of food by the time, I even received just 2 dishes.  Luckily we stood in separate lines.   For $37 I could have gone to a very nice place for lunch and not wasted my time.  This event was unorganized to handle so many people.  I do not believe I would do this again.
5	After shopping up a storm at Designer Studio Boutique & Tailoring and inducting Denise into our family - she recommended the Rumbi Island Grill. Considering it was just at the other side of the parking lot we were easy game. My sisters, Mom, and I walked into the place to check out the menu and were pleasantly surprised - there was a lot of healthy and delicious looking options to choose from. \n\nI went for the Voodoo chicken salad and was so impressed and thought it was absolutely delicious! The chicken was moist and flavorful, the sauce was tasty and not overdone. It was a filling yet light meal. \n\nThe place was very clean and comfortable and the perfect break between shopping trips!
4	I just caught the Pixies here on Friday night and forgot how much I loved the Mesa Amphitheater! Its been a few years since i've been there, in fact I think the last time I was there was the last time the Pixies were here. \n\nOne big down fall is the parking situation. Although by some sort of weasel like Magic my sister and I were able to get in the line for the parking lot and got the last spot for only $5! Score. \n\nThe line to get in was a bit of a cluster f*ck, but I ran into Dallas G. and chatted him up a bit, so that was cool. \n\nOnce in my sister and I got some pretty prime seats. We each brought in a 20 oz. bottle of water so we didn't have to pay some crazy price to keep hydrated, more venues should do this. \n\nThe sound was AMAZING! \n\nMy only other compliant is all the smoke. I get that its outside, but damn.... I felt sick to my stomach when we left. Maybe if they made a designated smoking area to keep it all in one place would be cool....but there I go showing my old again.
5	"""The rave reviews are well deserved, this restaurant is a true dining experience not to be missed.   We selected the wine pairing along with the tasting menu.   It was obvious that great care was given to the wine pairings.   The house sommelier was knowledgeable and approachable.  Binkley's tasting menu is not to be missed.  It is creative and surprising.  The between courses \amuse bouches were amazing! The services was informative and attentive.  This is a dining experience we will tell stories about - it is that outstanding."""""""
3	No, I'm really not fickle or wacko...I gave this store a five star on my previous review because at that time it really had amazing stuff. My husband figured it out:  There are no more, or not as many, foreclosures (which is a great thing) so apparently people aren't giving stuff away because they're kicked out of their home for money reasons.  ANYWAY, the last few months it's been very sparse there.  I asked the people who work there why inventory is down and they said not as many donate anymore.   Hmmmmm...makes perfect sense.  \nSoooooo....there really isn't the great stuff they had for the last year.  Just an update in case you visit.  Who knows though?  It could be different next month.
3	Gorgeous city view and fun ambiance.  There's a longhorn steer outside just so you get the message and you have the option of sliding (a slide!) into the restaurant.  Loved the country & western band playing and watching people dance; also loved walking out on the patio and watching the sun set.  Now for the food and service: we had a crabby waitress but even she couldn't ruin our great ribs, tender rolls and interesting prickly pear cactus fries appetizer.  \n\nI'd recommend this place, as long as you know what you're in for!
3	So I went back here yesterday with my mom to use our credit form the debacle from our last visit, and the staff really made up for the poor experience last time. The manager (Sean I think...) came over more than once to chat and was very apologetic. We ordered the same items this time (the pollo burrito and a cheese crisp with green onions and tomato) and the order was correct on this visit. Our waitress was also very sweet and took extra time with us. They also gave us a fried ice cream on the house, so it was very nice and I appreciate that this restaurant does the right thing when something goes wrong, that is a great quality in a restaurant. So, we have been going for many many years and will probably continue going, especially after this experience. The food is still just the typical Arizona Mexican food place, but at least they care about their customers.
2	The teas are amazing! However, I truly dislike the high pressure service/sales!!! I can read the sale signs, and if I need help or want to try a specific tea I will ask. I appreciate the friendly and welcoming feel and asking if I need help, but the pressuring to buy more than what I came in for makes me almost not want to walk into one of their stores and buy everything online!!! So, love the product , but the sales are a bit over the top!
5	Sometimes you just want a good burger and fantastic service.  Is that so much to ask?!  Burger a little pricey, but so perfectly cooked.\n\nThe service was so friendly, attentive and helpful.  It was my first time in the tempe/pheonix/scottsdale area and my server Jasmine was incredibly helpful in giving me ideas on what to do.\n\nBrian the manager was fantastic in making sure we were well taken care of and everything was spot on.  \n\nAnd their happy hour is fantastic!  Home run, and great first meal in AZ.
3	finally! the place slowed down a bit to stop in for a quick bite. it was MLK day, so i thought the crowd would be obsolete, NOT SO! it slowed for a minute, kinda like the waters parting, and then as i placed my order, and had a chat with Andy, the line swelled up again!!!! He said its all been done organically, no advertising, just word of mouth. Must be the BIG A_S tacos. They are litterally bursting with food. I tried the 3 pack of fish tacos. The fish was tender and delicious, however the rice and beans inside the taco was a new twist (next time that goes on the side!) that is where the filling comes from. I'm more of a fish, lettuce, cheese, salsa and lemon fish-taco-kinda-girl so the place only got a 3. However i'm sure on my second visit, the one where there won't be any rice or beans in my taco, will be a deliciously heaven like trip. If your a salsa freak (like my seester & I) this salsa is not for you. neither the green or red is tasty or hot, think salsa for americans.\n\n its so close to my place too! kudos on the local, glad the previous boutique moved (otherwise where would this tiny all inclusive place be?)\n\non a side note; the owner and his bro are the creators of Long Wongs Wings and Hippy Brother Burgers and they still have it!!! The place is a kitschy place. You go Andy ^_~ hope they come to Grand Avenue soon......
3	We just returned to Chicago Gyro's and had an -okay dinner. I should note that, in comparison to Pita Jungle, which we visited last week, there is really no comparison: Pita Jungle is superior. \nThe gyro meat at Chicago Gyro's was a little dry, but there was tons of it and it was smothered in the yummy sauce. My Greek salad was really good but again, Pita Jungle outdoes it. Still, it is a great place for an inexpensive lunch or dinner and they seem to have improved on the time it takes to get your meal.
2	"""If I could give this place a negative star, I would. It is where I shop for groceries, but I detest it every time I go. The only time it isn't busy with bus people and 19th Ave riff-raff (yes, I am being snarky and elitist, but I don't care!!!) is Saturday or Sunday mornings, anytime before 10 a.m. All that roam the isles at this time are nice, older people from the nearby retirement communities. I guess the stink of the city aren't quite up at that time. \n\nI once saw a man with a huge gash on his nose with blood dried up all over it.  I looked at him oddly, and he gave me a look back, like \hey, what are you lookin' at?!\"""" Ummmm... hello!  Plus it smells in there -- not a good attribute to have at grocery store -- and, it is nearly impossible to find a grocery cart or a nice check-out person.\n\nDespite all these unbearable flaws, I know I'll keep going.  I am a sucker for cheap prices!  Just remember: Before 10 a.m. + old people = good shopping experience; 5 p.m. on a Tuesday night (or any night for that matter) + weirdos = scary shopping experience.\n\nUpdate 2.2 - I feel a little bad about giving this Fry's only one star, especially since I shop there.  So, I'll give it at least two for some of its redeemable qualities.  However, today I got there early to do a little shopping, and it was fairly quiet with no lingering pee smell, but I still get aggravated by that store!  \n\nTheir Roma tomatoes were awful looking. I saw a produce stocker accidentally push a red bell pepper onto the floor and then picked it up, dust it off and put it back!  They failed to stock their frozen pizzas, which left me with about two options to choose from. And, they NEVER have any baggers.  My poor cashier had to bag everything.  \n\nOh, and to top it off, whenever I go there I have really bad cart karma.  I always pick a shitty one, I swear!  I really think I am going to buck it up and head to Safeway.  They always smile and say \""""Good Morning.\"""" I think that alone is worth a few extra bucks!"""""""
5	"""Sam, Sean, and Carlos. Nice guys.\n\nAs I meander through the desert and find new and unique places specific to Phoenix it is far and few between when the time comes that you find a business with such personal and authentic service.\n\nDo not let the lonely nondescript \Cigars\"""" sign disparage you from entering. It really is the best example of \""""do not judge a book by its cover.\"""" Because if you decided to be so superficial of its visage you will miss out on a quality local business.\n\nI do not smoke many cigar for health reasons, but when I do, I go here.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nNOte: Don't be that kid or guy walking in like you are the boss. Take a seat, chill, relax, and be a gentleman.\n\nR\\_"""""""
3	I was very excited about visiting Guido's. Been looking for a good Italian sub shop that cranks out a nice chicken parm sub. I went to Guido's with my wife and four year old daughter. The atmosphere was what I expected for an Italian market. The selection of items for sale was also interesting. As you wait for your food you can peruse the market area to kill time. The service was very attentive and the waitress was sweet. My wife ordered the fried calamari and she said it was delicious. So good even my four year old ate some. My daughter had a bowl of pasta with butter and cheese. Not rocket science at all. I ordered my longtime craved chicken parm sub. I was somewhat satisfied but the sauce was a little generic and the two pieces of chicken were so small they did not even fill the bread up. I would say overall my dish was okay. I would give them a try again as the menu is varied and I would give another dish a shot. The prices seemed very fair to me. I wish I could give them four stars but just not good enough the first time around. I will keep an open mind for next time and maybe find another star. Good appetite to you all!
5	Eccelente! I am constantly on the look out for Italian gente, and as soon as we walked into That's Amore, I knew I had found some. \n\nIt was late and a little girl was in the window. She told me her favorites: nocciola, amaretto, e stratacella - a woman of traditional tastes. Her father was cleaning up, and clearly ready to close, but he graciously served us. We shared short Italian banter - his daughter is clearly the talker in the family, and she loves to entertain. \n\nTheir selection of gelati is extensive. I have enough trouble choosing amongst 12 flavors, so this was just clearly going to be the biggest challenge of my night. I went with the little girl's faves - nocciola e amaretto. Delizioso. My date went for fruit - chocolate coconut and raspberry (lampone). Also excellent. The flavors are rich and the gelato creamy. Their store is fairly large and bright. Their display case is huge and its contents induce immediate salivation.\n\nTwo brothers and their wives run two locations. They are local, traditional, and a very nice family. I will definitely make the drive out to see them again. I love good gelato.
5	If you're new to the Valley and have absolutely no idea what grows here, come to Baker's.\n\nIf you've lived a long time here, know what doesn't shrivel to a dead dry crisp as soon as the thermometer hits 100 and are looking for plants and shrubs and trees, come to Baker's. \n\nIf you're just really, really into flora, come to Baker's. \n\nSometimes, hubby and I just drive over to spend a couple hours nosing around all the great stuff here--like roses, garden ornaments [not just plants], herbs, and lots of useful advice. All the folks who work here know their stuff and have probably been working here since they were kids themselves. We've even purchased an apple tree that thrives in Phoenix and produces little apples from Baker's!!\n\nSo green up your thumb and get yer yard stuff here.
2	My rating is based on my experience at the Kierland Commons location. I have been a P.F. Chang's customer since they opened, and have hosted many business lunches, family lunches, dinners an special occasions over the past years.\n\n2 stars for marginal service & average food quality. This chain started off as 4 stars and has been in a steady decline since 2006.\n\nI just gave P.F. Chang's a chance to redeem themselves last week with a party of 8. The food was a 3, the overall experience was below average. I tried to engage the server and have some fun but she was a ROBOT and did the absolute minimum.
1	The service here is TERRIBLE. Absolutely terrible. Every time we order for delivery or pick up they mess the order up horribly. The first time we completely got someone else's order. We are ordering for a dental office so we do not have the luxury of sending it back and waiting for them to get our order correct the second time. First, no one really cared but about an hour later we got a call from the manager giving us a credit to our account. \nWhen we went to use the credit, it was nowhere to be found of course. \nWe order one last time because the food is pretty good. Again, the charming service messed up the order. They charge extra for french fries, no big deal so we all paid extra and NO ONE got fries. When I called back to ask why we were charged for something and not given it--they did not care and then preceeded to HANG UP ON ME. \nPeople make mistakes but come on, every time we order?! Nothing bugs me more than wasting my money by overpaying for NOTHING. Especially getting hung up on because the people running the joint could not care less about anyone but themselves.\nI WILL NEVER COME TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN AND I WILL MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS THE EMPLOYEES ARE ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD. I would be fired at my own job for the way these people treat their customers.
4	Coronado Cafe is one of the things I miss most about living in the Coronado Historic District in downtown Phoenix. It's a quaint little bungalow converted into an adorable cafe with simple day fare such as yummy lunchtime salads and sandwiches, great weekend brunches (mmmm crab benedict), and some decent dinner options as well. They have an okay wine list and a great staff, but I think what I really liked about it was the very mellow, cozy feel and it's atmosphere.
5	If you've never been to the Luminarias or haven't been in a few years, THIS IS THE YEAR TO GO!   It's a 2 for 1 deal with the Chihuly exhibit.  The Garden is filled with his glass sculptures perfectly displayed among the natural elements of the Garden.  The lighting of sculptures is stunning.  And, of course, the luminarias are always beautiful.\n\nMeal tickets are available.  There are also cash bars with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages including hot cider and cocoa.  Wine tasting as well.  There are plenty of entertainers scattered throughout the Garden.  I always enjoy the Handbell Choirs especially.  Adult tickets are $20 members, $25 non-members.  Reduced prices for kids, but I don't really think the young ones would enjoy it.\n\nExpect it to be crowded this year.  We attended a members only night and it seemed to be oversold as parking was hard to come by.  However, if you venture away from the Chihuly exhibits, you can find a moment or two in solitude among the luminarias.  That alone is worth the ticket.
5	One of the most romantic places I've ever eaten dinner is at Michelina's in Phoenix, and if you haven't been there yet, I suggest you set up your next date there now.\n\nThe Italian restaurant, run by Miss Michelina DiSibio, is a gorgeous fresh flower-filled eatery, complete with white linen-covered tables, pretty lighting and friendly, competent servers. And usually, Michelina herself visits tables to make sure guests are perfectly satisfied with what they're dining on.\n\nThe menu is classic Italian, with recipes Michelina brought with her from her native Italy. At a recent visit, I had the absolutely amazing pasta shells stuffed with spinach and ricotta ($17.95), which I covered in both alfredo and marinara sauces to create a divine creamy concotion. I've been there many times and also really love the salads and desserts, especially the tiramisu. Everyone I've dined there with has also raved about the food.\n\nThe place is so pretty and cozy, the food so delicious and the staff so professional and friendly, it's a guarantee you'll want to go back.
2	"""I took my three small children here a few weeks ago. We have been several times to another trampoline park in Scottsdale but we wanted to try Sky Park because it is in the neighborhood. \n\nI can only speak to the \under 7 area\"""" and the foam pit, because that is where we spent all of our time. We went during the week, so it was not crowded, which was nice. There were only three other children in the area, but one (according to staff) was the owner's son and he was allowed to jump with his shoes ON and climbed up the trampolines, which (also, according to staff) was not permitted. I was extremely frustrated by this, as it encouraged other children to do the same, then when they were asked to stop were confused.  The staff was young and, apparently, afraid to tell this boy that he needed to follow the rules that were implemented for the safety of all customers. I asked the staff member why she didn't ask him to take his shoes off and why she allowed him to climb when it was against the rules.  Her response was a timid \""""he is the owner's son.\""""  \n\nThe trampoline area was fun and I liked that they had big sofas for parents to sit and watch the children, but I was disappointed it didn't have at least one bounce house with a slide for the younger kids.  The other park in Scottsdale has an area with two bounce houses (both with slides) and a trampoline area just for younger kids, which is really perfect.  I hope that Sky Park will incorporate this. If not, I am not sure we will be back. \n\nThe foam Pit was nice and well organized by staff member who insisted all the children jump one at a time and wait for the other kids to get out before they jump. He said weekends were \""""crazy\"""" and he felt much safer implementing this policy. I was thankful for the attention to this and his work to keep it both fun and safe for smaller children. \n\nAnother complaint - a sign (and policy?) that reads \""""no outside drinks including bottled water.\""""  This is outrageous to me. If I am paying to bring my children, I am not going to pay $1 or more for each bottle of water. I understand it is an easy way for them to make money but it will discourage me from ever returning unless they change this policy to allow for water.  I understand not allowing soda, coffee, etc. because of the risk of spilling, but prohibiting water is ridiculous and a poor business decision."""""""
5	Zen.  Built into the Mountain, this resort is as unique as it gets.  Huge rooms with beautiful interiors.  This resort is twice removed from the noise and bustle of Scottsdale.  With mutiple pools on the property and winding layout, you will need to utilize the golf cart service provided.  Ask to be seated with a view in the restaurant at lunchtime, you wont regret it!  Cozy up to the firepit on a cool desert night in the bar area and learn to relax when you visit the Sanctuary on Camelback, its impossible not to!
3	"""(3.5 stars)\n\nThe very first thing I was reminded of when I walked into Kazimierz was a Poe* story I read in HS (there goes any possible \cool\"""" cred--oh, well). Upon walking in, the darkness is the first thing that enveloped me. Once my eyes adjusted, I thought, \""""I see a long, brick corridor and lots of wine barrels. This is very cool and unexpected.\"""" If someone randomly placed me inside, I would have thought I was underground. \n\nI can't tell you much about the decor since it's dark. There are plush, large couches (most were reserved because there was a band coming on @ 9pm) in the middle area and tables along the back wall. There's a bar area too. \n\nThey have many specials. E and me got the 3 flights (great deal) each special. E got the chard and reds [mix] special and I got the rose and 2 pinots special. E's favorite was the chard. I liked the rose, I did not like the 2nd pinot, but the 3rd was nice. Alcohol's subjective, though. \n\nWe also ordered bourbon, honey, walnut, brie fondue, which comes with slices of french bread and thinly sliced apples. Brie, bourbon, honey, and walnuts are good alone, but they're GREAT together. Sweet, creamy, with the slight bite of Bourbon, and a crunch either with a sour granny smith or some French Bread: my taste buds were happy. \n\nNeither one of us has been in before, so we asked our server for guidance. Christina made great suggestions [brie dish], had a fun personality, and checked up appropriately. \n\nPrices: comparable to any standard wine bar, so fair.\n\nKazimieriz is a cool place. They have a good wine and beverage (beer and cocktails too) list. Even though it's really dark, it has a warm ambiance. I'd return. \n\n*The Cask of Amontillado. It's about 2 friends, a rare wine, and there's a part about walking through a long dark corridor. I'm leaving it to that just in case you want to brush up on your Poe."""""""
5	Stinkweeds is what quintessentially a Small Indie Record Store should be. Plain and Simple. Great underground selection, knowledgeable staff with just enough record store attitude (I kid Lindsay, I kid), and i can't go in there without finding at least ten things i absolutely have to have.  I'm in record and book stores so much that i constantly have titles and bands and weird EPs fluctuating in my head, and it'll just so happen that I'm looking for something obscure in the used CD section, and bam, they've got like three different titles to choose from for that artist and usually one of them is something i've never even heard of.  Word to the wise, if you're gonna sell them stuff, make sure the vinyl is in excellent condition, they only believe in selling high quality used merchandise at what is more often than not, very reasonably priced.  That and they have the best selection of magazines too. Big Ups!!
4	Old Chicago is minutes from my apartment, and for as long as I've lived in this area, I've never made it to Old Chicago before.\n\nFor my first time here, I really enjoyed it.  It was late on a Sunday night, and both myself and a friend of mine were both craving pizza late at night.  We ended up here because they were open, and I'm glad we stopped in.\n\nService was great, and they have $3 long islands all day every day.  I'm not much of a drinker, but I do have a weakness for long islands.  We ended up ordering a medium deep dish pizza, and I really enjoyed it here.  They also have Karaoke here Sunday nights from 9-1, which we watched from our dining room table.  They have outdoor seating, indoor seating, and bar seating, which is great!\n\nIn between the great hours, drink specials and tasty pizza, I will probably be back.
5	The service level of Nordstrom's never ceases to amaze me. On a recent visit to ladies clothes I found a really cute dress that I didn't notice until I got home had a flaw in it- brought it back...the Assistant Manager, Alex Bixler was nothing short of amazing.  She called 7 different stores while I waited to find one that was not flawed.  I would highly recommend this person to assist anyone looking for clothes.  I heard her helping others too.  She is professional, knows the lines and is honest.  I will be making sure I shop when she works and would recommend her for anyone looking for someone to assist them to ask for Alex.
5	This was actually the first place I ever ate Sushi and made me a sushi lover. I have eaten all over the valley yet keep coming back here for more. The new chef is full of personality that goes along with all the staff. I always enjoy my visits and now that they are installing TVs on the wall it will be become a regular hangout. \n\nMy last visit the place was placed full and people still waited to be served. No matter if you want it to go or a night out make sure you give it a try. \n\nSee you there !!!
3	I have visited this restaurant a handful of times over the last 7 years.  I have always enjoyed it because it's clean, small and not loud.  The sushi is consistently good and they have a great selection. I have two complaints: first,  the staff has no personality.  They don't make an effort to interact with you and make you feel welcome.  Second, it's a little pricey.\n\nI was recently there with my 4 year old and she enjoyed it very much.  We will most likely keep going back until we find another small sushi place to go to.
1	Watch out for thieves. The rented rafts get stolen if you look the other way, my sons shoes were stolen, the pretzels we bought to snack were stolen, even my sunscreen  was stolen right in front of my nose. Parents are just as trifling as bad kids, if you see your child is wearing someone else's shoes why do you allow and encourage that?  And how are you going to eat someones food? This is just nasty. I rather pay more and go to Wet and Wild instead and save myself from little criminals and their parents.
4	"""Was going to \North\"""" for lunch today in Glendale to my surprise it's now Ninf'a's Mexican Kitchen...  It changed from a Fox restaurant to a Legacy owned restaurant.  \n\nWe were game for a new experience, so we tried this Houston based tex-mex restaurant.  I was hit with the smell of fresh tortillas when we walked in the door. They redecorated the place and it's very inviting, nicely decorated with very comfy booths and a warm atmosphere.  They have a full bar with limited wine selections, beer on tap and bottles, sangria and fantastic margarita's.  \n \nWe were seated and treated to some of the nicest service I've experienced in a good while. Our server was amazing and delightful.  She very attentive to our drinks and took just enough time to explain their menu and specialties. Some servers can be \""""over the top\"""" especially when a place is new, but she was extremely pleasant. \n\nWe started with queso. Fresh chunks of green onion, tomato and cilantro leaves made the queso an instant hit with me. Nothing worse than getting bad queso, but no worries here--theirs is a class act. The house chips and salsa's are also really good and served right away as we sat down. \n\nI was going to try their homemade Horchata but ordered a melon agua fresca with my food instead.  It's a short but sweet affair, as it comes out in a cocktail glass. If you're looking for the giant tub you usually get when ordering one of these guys--not here. If you don't know what I'm talking about, just nod. The melon, however, was fresh, sweet and delightful. \n\nI'll have fajitas once in a while, but it's not something I get excited about at a restaurant because they generally taste the same everywhere I've had them. At Ninfa's however it was \""""excellente\"""" when it comes to fajita's. The sizzling plate came out and my eyes widened at the wonderful smell and beautiful the strips of meat.  Things we tried and were also very tasty: carne asada, chicken enchiladas, shrimp chiveche salad and chicken and avocado salad, yum! \n\nSadly, I had to hit the road and keep working but at least my appetite was content. I'll definitely be back and looking forward to giving them a 5th star. I think my only dilemma will be ordering something other than the fajitas next time...."""""""
2	"""This last time was my second time to eat at the Parlor, wanted my boyfriend and my brother to try it, I had gone there for lunch one other time and liked it, I think it was around opening week.  IDK what happened to but the service was BAD! the food was JUST OKAY, the people who worked there were \really\"""" cool. the attitude smelled so bad, wait maybe it was the food? i will never return to the parlor again it is over glamourized pizza served with a bad attitde! you can get better at NYPD or PIzzano's if you are looking for pizza in that area!"""""""
4	"""My mom and I decided we wanted to eat somewhere healthy after taking a grueling gym class...only made sense. She had heard that this place only used \Farm Fresh\"""" food, so I checked Yelp. Sure enough almost everyone seemed to like the quality. \n\nThe inside is cute in my opinion- cute booths, couch chairs, bike art, a bar, and outdoor seating. The servers were super friendly and helpful, but I must admit they took forever to serve us our food. It's definitely the kind of place that you need to order drinks first to better deal with the long waiting period. \n\nThe food definitely deserved a full 5 stars (but the wait knocked my review down to 4.5).  After many Yelpers raved about the Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas, I decided to order that. OMG sooo good! I'm honestly going to say that it was one of the best dinner dishes I've ordered in a while. It also came with a large portion of salad that had a tasty vinaigrette on it. The green sauce on the enchilada was especially good, but there was some super spicy element I couldn't quite put my finger on. Oh well, a little burn is good once in awhile right? We also ordered the Smoked Trout Beignets with at Red Pepper Aioli, which were amazing. I wish it came with about 10 more on the plate haha. My mom wasn't very hungry and just ordered the Balsamic Tangerine Beets (which were super good), and the Chickpeas w/ Red Quinoa. \n\nNext time I get a chance to come here, I want to indulge in their tapas style cheese menu and order some of their delicious looking cocktails...and sit outside if it's not 108 degrees? All in all, a winner in my book!"""""""
3	Aside from the long drive, I was pretty excited to visit this place.  I was lured by friends, family, YELP reviews and their website who all said the tour, samples and food were excellent.\n\nThe grounds and retail area were both very charming.  We browsed their huge selection of custom olive oils, spreads and other misc. offerings.  Their selection is pretty impressive and it looks like they have some quality stuff.\n\nI was very disappointed with the samples though.  All they had was about 5 spreads and about 15 olive oils set out for you to sample.  Now it wouldn't be that bad if they had some bread to put the spreads on or to dip in the olive oil.  Instead they gave you little wood spreader things (like small popsicle sticks) to taste the spreads and little plastic cups to taste the olive oils.  The place where they set all their olive oil samples wasn't laid out very well either.  It was just a small table with open bottles next to some little plastic cups.  The area would often get crowded as people tried to figure out what to do with little cups of olive oil.  Anyway, if you visit the QCCOM be sure to pack some bread, crackers or pretzels so you can better experience what they have.  However I guess the joke is on me because somehow I spent like $75 on olive oils and I didn't even know that was possible.\n\nThe friends my wife and I went with had been there before and said the tour wasn't really worth it so we opted out.  I probably should have experienced the tour for myself but whatever.  Maybe next time.  But the tour didn't look that impressive so I'm not that heartbroken.\n\nWe ate in their cafe for lunch and here is the breakdown:\n\n* veggie antipasto plate - this was good\n\n* kalamata sandwich - eh.  I got the 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad (chix ceasar - was 'eh' as well)\n\n* dessert bruschetta (honey marscapone & nutella) - excellent!\n\nYou can eat inside but the whether was nice when I went so I sat outside.  It is a nice little area to sit, eat and ponder just how many snow birds flock to this place.  Anyway, I wish I had more to say but I just don't.  You probably get excited when you read the menu and think how wonderful the food is, but I just didn't think it was all that great.  It wasn't horrible, just not all that great.  If I were there again in the future I would absolutely give it another shot, but I'm not going to go out of my way to try it again.
2	"""Ok here is the thing, I went back another time and it was good. \n\nAbout a month later we came late with our roomie. It was bar service only since it was late. \n\nThe bartender a middle aged over weight red haired guy went to get our chips..\n\n\nI watched him walk over to the chips and grab handfuls of chips with his bare hands. HE IS THE BARTENDER HANDLEING MONEY AND HE WAS JUST HOLDING A DIRTY RAG.\n\nI asked him for a new batch that was \hand picked\"""" he said it was all bare hand touched. \n\nI told him that was fine for the food preparers that dont handle fecal, infectious disease money!!\n\nHe acted like I was retard, I didnt eat anything after I saw this but we did have a few bites and the food was not good.\n\nIt wasnt aweful but it wasnt good as before, AT ALL!\n\nGet it together over there\n\n\nmore like 2 and a half\n\nP.S. If the owners read this, he needs to be schooled. I wish I knew his name, he may have had a mustache?"""""""
5	I have passed this place for 20 years and had always heard good things. Well one night when we were kidless we went. It was pricier that we thought but we forgot the price once the meals arrived. We were both very impressed. Warm homemade bread. Awesome salads. I tried the escolar (it's a fish that a friend of mine loved but I had never tried it) and it absolutely melted in my mouth. My husband enjoyed his sausage and peppers. We will definitely go back!
3	I love the food at FEZ, however, the service has a lot to be desired. I ate there twice in the last few weeks and both times had very poor service. The second time I was there the server never came back after serving our food, she didn't once ask if the food was OK and we were out of water for what seemed like an eternity. I like the food but if the poor service doesn't improve I will stop eating there.
3	After the yelp diy event at make we went here to grad a drink/bite! it was okay but a little pricy! but the bar tender was super hot/nice so that's a plus!! Oh yea and did I mention her was a nursing student?!? hard worker with goals, i like, i like! Prices are okay moderate, but my fellow elite got sashimi and was charged $21 for like four pieces ekkk! the bar area was pretty, I'll go back maybe if im at the quarter!
1	Sorry, but something must have happened to this place since Ellen J. and Monica B. wrote their reviews.  My girlfriend and I went there tonight for our monthly sushi fix and to catch up.  It was nice to have it so quiet - we were the only ones in the restaurant for an hour - but we understand why.  The service was attentive but the food was poor.  The portions are small - you get twice as much at most other places for the same price - the happy hour offered nothing of interest - and they do not have a full bar as is listed - only beer and wine.  Imitation crabmeat?  Sorry - that's just not authentic fare and definitely not serious sushi.   We were very disappointed.  Fortunately the conversation was good!  But we won't be back here again.
2	"""Not sure what kind of service one would get at these ProTan USA places for their Infrared body wraps.... Tried to schedule an appointment Friday and was told to call back. I wasn't asking for a Friday appointment - merely wanted to schedule one for a future date. There was no explanation.... the person who answered the phone just said, \I'm not scheduling appointments today. You'll need to call back tomorrow.\"""" I'll look around for this service with other facilities - hopefully there'll be a few who want the business. Apparently ProTan does not."""""""
4	we were looking for a club but apparently thursday nights most of the clubs start hopping after 11pm. we decided to stop into Majerles's instead and we had a nice time here. I ordered a kilt lifter four peaks and although I don't love beer, this one went down nice. Hubster ordered a burger and I don't really tend to eat burgers so shared his string fries. he loved the burger and his blue moon. We chatted up with our neighbors and meet a guy that looked like Kevin Bacon. :) chill place with decent music.  The only negative I did notice was that the bartender thought she was too cool for school. overall, I would still return if in the area.
5	HIDDEN GEM ALERT!!! I found about this place last week when I made a wrong turn into the parking lot and was starving, so I decided to try it out. \n\nI've been back 3 times since. This place is awesome.  It's fast, fresh, cooked to order .  To be fair, I have only had the blackened chicken tacos on corn tortillas each time, but they are THAT good.  the serving sizes are no joke either, so be prepared to share or be really full.  \n\nThe horchata is pretty damn good too. \n\n My fiance has tried the bean burrito, the blackened chicken burrito and the fajitas and all have gotten rave reviews from him and he's pretty picky about his mexican food.\n\nThe prices are moderate, which makes it an even better find.  The service is always top notch, eager to help.  Excellent food and great prices, what could be better?
4	Solid 4 stars for The Living Room. Places like this are hard to find in South Chandler. Very welcome change from the monotony of chain establishments in the area. Don't come here expecting authentic Bruschetta. The bread is much thicker cut, and does not have the flavor of a toasted french bread. If you can put that aside, the toppings are excellent. I had the proscuitto and brie pressed sandwich, an interesting synthesis of French and Italian staples. \n\nOverall the ambiance of The Living Room is what adds to the charm. Even on an early summer evening, sitting out on the patio is a great way to relax and catch up with your co-diners.
4	"""Last night I went to the new El Chorro.  It's nothing like the old El Chorro and it pulled on my heart strings to tour the beautiful, yet unrecognizable, restaurant.  Nothing stays the same and I love change, but not when it involves my valley institutions.  Soon nothing in my life will resemble my childhood and I will have no attachment to this town.  When Avanti goes, that will for sure be the end.  Ok, I'm done whining.  Hey, I wasn't the only one.  I noticed plenty of others reminiscing... they did happen to be my grandparents age, but I guess that just means I'm wise beyond my years.  Ha.  \n\nThe new El Chorro is incredible and if you knew nothing of the Old El Chorro, you'll like it that much more.  It was a last minute idea to swing by for dinner and the place was packed.  So packed that we couldn't get a table.  I've never been without a reservation and I figured a weekday was a good time to try... think again.  Luckily, the bartender (where the old bar used to be) told us not to worry because she wasn't going to turn customers away.  She obviously wasn't working there the time my uncle threatened to burn down an umbrella because it was blocking the view... he did tip $100 to the guy for moving it, though.  His personality allows him to say things like that without causing anyone to feel alarm... or maybe it was the $100?  Anyway, El Chorro lacks nothing in the customer service department.\n\nSo we sat, my mother, her ex and me.  An odd group of three.  He is totally still in love with her, so I encourage these little gatherings.  Between the three of us, we ordered the filet, trout, and escolar.  All delicious, but I am still saddened by the menu change.  No beloved eggs benedict (that was served all day).  No chicken livers.  No jumbo shrimp (even though it's on their menu).  The only thing retained- the sticky buns.  Thank God for that.  \n\nHighlight of the meal was when the bartender made some after dinner shots when he overheard us discussing dessert.  I asked him, \what are these babies called?\""""  He responded, \""""wet dream.\""""  Great, I was having a shot called a wet dream with my mom and her ex.  Not awkward at all.  Actually, it was pretty funny and the shots were deliciously cinnamony.   \n\nEl Chorro, I still love you.  You're like a relative who got a facelift and although I no longer recognize you, you're still the same inside."""""""
4	I've been coming here pretty regularly since the spring, so I like to think I've got a pretty good gauge of what you can expect.\n\nIn terms of service, the servers here do pretty well. The servers are attentive and will come by at frequent but not annoying intervals with water or queries about your meal. Also, if they get your order wrong or forget something (which has only happened once in all the meals I've had here), they'll apologize, correct the error, and possibly send you a little something extra in apology.\n\nAs for the food, there's no place better for a sushi fix. It's not even a contest. The sushi nigiri is pretty standard-- I highly recommend the binnaga, if only for that savory fried garlic topping, and the spicy hotate [scallop]... I make it a point to get this every time I go. Their sashimi cuts are very generous by any standards. I would recommend the Chirashi C sashimi option, which includes two pieces each of sake, hamachi, and unagi, as well as other accompanying elements. For rolls, the Hawaii roll particularly stands out, and the Blue Moonlight's pretty good. \n\nNote: If the prices seem to be a little much, just think about how many kinds of fish you'll be getting.  And if you can't make up your mind, go during happy hour, sit at the bar, and have one of the sushi chefs pick for you. The chefs are friendly and polite, and in these moments of indecision (to which I am prone), they'll ask about what you like and figure out what to serve you.\n\nTheir general attitude is right on par with the decor: warm, friendly, and bright.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend Sapporos if you're in the mood for a non-casual, sushi-filled meal. It's not the end all, be all of sushi, but it's the best sushi you'll find near Scottsdale Airpark, hands down.
5	I've been to many other Cities (L.A, san Francisco, Sacramento, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Tucson) And I Love Phoenix Out of al of them. From the First Class Shopping, to the Desert Scenery. It's a Ahh Inspiring City. Its not as dirty as many other major cities, and the crime has gone down so Much. its not even on the top 100 list of dangerous cities. And the people are so nice, i go on hikes and bike rides around the city and (Im not exaggerating) Every person I pass says good morning. My only con is the traffic! Around rush Hour OMG! Its Busy. But other from that I love it here!
5	We just ate at FnB and loved it!  We had a ring side seat and was able to view the grill as the chef cooked...it was exciting...but a bit warm:)  We had a burrata salad(type of fresh gooey mild cheese) and a savory pana cotta salad...both were unique and flavorful.  For the dinner course...the past was excellent although not house made, had loads of fresh interesting mushrooms and house made ham and a pork chop over corn that was juicy and delicious.  We were pretty full but we ate the chocolate pudding with salty cream and enjoyed it.  Must have reservations...this place is small and fills up quickly.  The wine is nice as they serve all Arizona Wines.  Enjoy and support this nice local place!
2	It's a multi-plex. They are all about the same. \n\nThe reason for the 2 stars:\n-- How did going to the movies cost $32.75? (2 tickets, 1 large popcorn [which is actually very small] and 1 water).\n-- They don't have soda alternatives... like, let's say, iced tea. They have fruit punch with the large beverage free refill products... but that's loaded with sugar. Ewe. I had no option but the purchase a water. With no refills.\n-- The restrooms were a disaster.
4	"""I honestly can't tell if this business started up as a passion project or someone's idea of the funniest way to rip off the rich and convince them that they were being trendy.\n\nI'm always fighting an internal battle when it comes to Sprinkles. While they're ultimately VERY tasty and definitely the best cupcakes I've ever had, I still find myself thinking, \I'm paying that much for six cupcakes? Really?\"""" I've been eating they're cupcakes since a few years back when I lived in LA and these were the new \""""in\"""" thing in Beverly Hills. It's no surprise that their first move out of CA was to Scottsdale and besides In-N-Out, it's one of the best imported franchises they have to offer.\n\nTo be honest, as far as flavors go, you can't really go wrong with anything you pick here. They're super rich, so really think about if you want just two or a dozen. It makes sense as to why they give you a fork a knife to eat these things.\n\nWhen it really boils down to it, Sprinkles is a guilty pleasure. By picking up an order here and enjoying it, you feel like you should be at a party with the kind of people that dress their chihuahuas in juicy couture hoodies and drink only beverages that some how include hand picked wheat grass from Bali. On the other hand, the cupcakes are so good that you decide to suck it up and savor the taste."""""""
2	I was totally underwhelmed - and totally shocked given all the exceptional reviews from other trusted Yelp Elites.\n\nThe rice was WEIRD. There were frozen peas, carrots, and green beans in it, and I swear the rice was Uncle Ben's. \n\nThey don't really have chips. They broke up some tostadas and put them on a plate. How weird. \n\n2 stars for the authenticity and quality of the food, lack of chips, prices not in line with the level of quality of the food, and totally overdone vibe.\n\nOverall: Not great, over priced, overdone, and... weird.
2	"""\Hey Giambi, I've got money on you this year!\""""\n\nWhat kind of place kicks out 10 grown men from dinner that they've already ordered for being too obnoxious?  I mean we're hotel guests for Christ's sake.  Isn't it normal for a group of people to each have well over 10 drinks before the sun sets and then want to go have a classy dinner at a nice hotel?  Well apparently it's not ok to be piss drunk, cat call at women and stand up and yell stuff at the Oakland A's as they exited their team dinner, at least not at the Valley Ho.\n\nIn all seriousness we're lucky they didn't kick us out of the entire hotel.  I'll give Valley Ho 2 stars for that and nothing more.  Majorly overpriced for Scottsdale, the rooms seem futuristic in a cheap way and nothing stood out to me as cool.  The pool area is nice but what pool isn't nice in mid-March when you're coming from 50 degree weather?  It's obvious this place used to be a Best Western or some other cheap chain, you can dress a place up but the layout screams 2 star resort.  The best part of the stay was seeing the look on the hostess' face when we all showed up at the restaurant for breakfast after being kicked out the night before.  Get those bloody mary's ready bitch.  \n\nIf they cut your group off of drinking while dining at the Valley Ho I'd suggest not bypassing the waitress and ordering straight from the bar, it'll get you 86'd faster than trying to dry hump your date in an 8th grade dance."""""""
4	"""This review is for the pool and bar (as a non-guest) only.\n\nThe Clarendon pool is open to non-guests for a nominal fee ($10) payable at the front desk, and for an additional $2, you can get a hotel towel. The Clarendon's facebook page says that if you show your ASU ID, you can get free pool access!\n\nWe paid at the front desk, but didn't get any kind of receipt or wristband, so if you're wondering if you could get by without paying... the answer is probably yes. There are public restrooms inside the lobby (walk towards the restaurant and then left down the hallway).\n\nThe tasty Gallo Blanco restaurant and bar is right there for your enjoyment too. Tuesday is \taco tuesday\"""" where you can buy 2 tacos, get 1 free. Drinks are yummy and run about $8.00. Be sure to tell them you're at the pool so they can put your drink in a plastic cup.\n\nThe pool and hot tub are awesome... if you do any underwater swimming or floating, you can hear some retro-type music playing underwater!

4	Excited this place is finally open! The short rib dip was delicious, and the mac and cheese couldn't have been better. Definitely get the mac and cheese. \n\nAtmosphere is just what we need in this neck of the woods. The bar could definitely be a nice place for happy hour in the future.\n\nThe service left a lot to be desired, but I'm hoping that gets better with time.  \n\nOverall, great new place! Looking forward to going back to try more.
4	Finally got around to trying Caffe Boa.  After watching Payton butcher a pig at Devoured, I really had no choice but to see what kinds of food this guy pumped out.\n\nI was impressed with the giant paper cone of french fries that I ordered an an app.  They were quite good and the sauces that came with them were out of this world.\n\nThe calzone that I ordered was probably not the best advised decision I've ever made.  It was good and I enjoyed the strange flatbread that housed the innards but it just didn't give me what I was looking for in a calzone.  It was good, just a bit weird for my tastes.  That's not to say that everything inside the flatbread wasn't good - it was.  I just wouldn't order this again.\n\nThe service was good and I enjoyed the patio but the strip mall feel left a lot to be desired.  I hope rent is cheap.
5	I had to travel all the way to Phoenix for some good fried chicken!!  After a super hot day of walking through the Botanical Gardens, the only thing that got me through was thinking about checking out Lo-Lo's and the let me tell you that they didn't disappoint!  The place was packed at 5pm but we luckily got in super fast.  Our table tried a little bit of everything.  The Chicken and Waffles, Fried Catfish, Fried Redfish, Collard Greens, and the Gizzards.  Let me start with my favorite, the fried chicken.  Delicious!!  Perfectly seasoned and crispy.  It's hard to find a place where they put the right seasonings in the fried chicken, but Lo-Lo's got it just right.   A great balance of seasoning to give the chicken some zing and super crispy.  The catfish was great, with a similar seasoning.  Nice big filets and not greasy at all, same goes for the redfish.  The redfish was like a southern version of fish and chips.  I'm not a fan of gizzards, but Lo-Lo's got it right so that they were tender instead of rubbery and how can it fail smothered with gravy?  Let's also not forget the waffle, damn that thing was good, with some cinnamon or something in the batter so that it was just a good without the syrup.  \n\nI'm also an unsweetened tea kind of girl now, but Lo-Lo's brought back memories with their sweetened tea in big mason jars, just perfect.\n\nThe service was great as well.  Enjoy the ambiance b/c it was authentic and the people that waited on us were awesome.\n\nI'll be making Lo-Lo's a permanent stop on all my trips back to Phoenix!!
5	"""\OMG\"""" Le Chalet was fabioso... Entertainment, Great clean comedy for a Sunday evening. Food, sooooo delicious. Service was great!  Price, we split between a party of 6.

If you decide to give it a try you have to try a Crepe. One more thing; you get to watch the chef on a big screen TV prepare your meal. I have down loaded a few pictures hopefully they go through."""""""
2	We went there for a leisurely dinner at about 6:30.  We ordered an appetizer, salad, and a pizza.  Well before we could finish the calamari and before we could dent our salad, the waitress was trying to clear a spot for the pizza  Although she said she wasn't trying to rush us and would keep the pie warm until we were ready, not much more than 5 minutes passed and she brought it back again!  You'd have thought the were trying to close.\n\nThe calamari was good.  The antipasto salad was tasteless except for the dressing which was overpoweringly acidic.  The pizza crust was doughy. The toppings sparse and as tasteless as the sauce.  Thankfully, it's no place I'll ever find it necessary to return.
4	Amazing! Without question, the best hotel spa - scratch that, spa - I've ever visited!\n\nI had a vineyard facial (a summer special) and it was WONDERFUL! The facilities here are amazing - rooftop pool, fitness center, relaxation room, sauna - the list goes on!\n\nThe only negatives - I also had a pedicure and manicure, both of which were disappointing and extremely, extremely overpriced for what I got - the manicure/pedicure I get from the mall are just as good and half the price. \n\nStick with the facials, massages, etc. and you'll love Joya!
5	Outstanding Spring Training locale. Padres share this facility with the Mariners, and the folks who staff the place during spring baseball are some of the nicest folks you'll ever meet. Lots of practice fields, and access to players. If you're an autograph seeker, or just a fan of the game, this is a really unique (and at times surreal) experience. Great for young kids.\n\nThe fare at this park is the best of all spring training locations. They've got it all, and the layout is much more family-friendly than other parks. Lots of grass, shaded dining areas, and fun stuff for kids to play on/around.
3	souper salad's tagline: 'there is a reason we're way cheaper than sweet tomatoes.'\n\nthat said, i eat here about three times a week because of its proximity to my office. i like it just fine.  granted, i've mastered the art of cramming so much food into the to-go box that i can eat for two days. not bad for $4.41.  \n\nthe people are usually friendly. and they look the other way when i smash tacos on top of my salad and have trouble securing the lid. ha.\n\ni've also debated the merits of filling the to-go box with some of their 'pricier' bar items. i mean. i think i could probably shove more than $4 worth of pepperoni in there. i'll post a picture the first time i try that. ha.
2	I had high hopes as a Coloradan in Arizona after I read all the other reviews on Yelp. My husband and I ordered the tamale, taco combo plate with green chili. It was the blandest food I've ever eaten, and it was swimming in cheese. There was no flavor at all in anything on the plate. Even Chipotle is better.\n\nMy husband had avoided this place because its name is so stupid. Well, now we know the food is on the same level. We went because they offer a drive-through window if you call ahead. I think that's the best thing I can say about it.
4	"""Out with two buds tonight on a quest for some good BBQ and to zap a few other cravings. I've been here one or two times before but for whatever reason was never able to try a lot of things.\n\nFirst off I love the atmosphere and decor of the place. Upscale bayou? can that exist? seems like they were able to do it. Plus its nice and dark and comfortable.\n\nOne thing I recall is how great the service is EVERY TIME i go. Three different visits.. three different servers.. top notch each time.\n\nFood!\n\nAppetizers\n\nWings:\nDelicious! These are smoked, fried, and then sauced. I hate(strong word on purpose) baked wings. I thought I was going to hate these but the combo of the smoked then fried works amazingly. It allows them to only flash fry for crisp. This keeps the wings juicy and plump but with the fried crispy skin that wings should have.\n\nBrisket Fire-Pie:\nDon't bother :/ I knew this was risky but I had a pizza craving. Normally BBQ pizzas have way to much BBQ sauce. This was the opposite it had very little sauce.. so little that it had no flavor impact leaving you wondering what that funky after taste is.\n\nCornbread:\nStrong corn flavor.. not overly sweet. Could feel the grease/butter levels killing me not so slowly. But was good to the taste buds.\n-----------------\nBBQ\n\nPulled Pork:\nNice smoke flavor and good moisture content without being overly fatty. Not the best I've had but no complaints.\n\nBrisket:\nSame feelings as the pork. It was good and executed properly but certainly not the best I've ever had. None of the BBQ was overly salty but some of it was to far on the other end of the scope and could have used some more salt. There was no real bark on the brisket which was a little disappointing.\n\nSmoke Links:\nI didn't care for these at all. They were to fatty for my taste and needed more... something in your face. I think everyone agreed these were the our least favorite items.\n\nBaby Back Ribs:\nVery tasty ribs but surprisingly not my favorite out of the three offered. These are usually the safe best for best ribs at whatever place your at. There was something out of whack with the meat itself. It failed to really pick up the smoke flavor maybe? They were moist and tender and fall off the bone. But fall off the bone on the side of smoked to long.\n\nBeef Ribs:\nSurprisingly lean for beef ribs. Since they were so lean these could have used a little more time in the smoke unlike the baby backs. Beef ribs take a much longer time to break down to perfection.\n\nSt Louis Style Ribs:\nYUM! Best ribs on the menu. Next time this is all I will order in the rib category. Flavor was great., meat was great., still a little over done but it took nothing away from them. I would come back for this alone.\n-------------------\n\nSides\n\nMac & Cheese:\nDelicious but they went the fake cheese route. It is hard to make good mac and cheese the old fashion way. Its hard in small quantity let alone restaurant quantity. I would rather have them understand this and serve it with primarily fake cheese and be tasty then try and do from scratch and serve me curdled cheese fail.\n\nPecan Cole Slaw:\nAlso sexy! Crisp, cold, refreshing, and not soggy. The nuts were a nice addition but if they could have somehow brought it out more in the dish it would have been ever better.\n\nPotato Salad:\nMmmmmm. This was great and a tie for best side dish with the mac and cheese. Be warned.. This is HEAVY. Its probably 90% mayo but its potato salad.. its not healthy don't try and make it healthy. They did it right. It took a year off my life and I loved every bite of it. Its the bad years anyway! Creamy, perfect amount of mustard, great seasoning, lots of fresh dill.\n\nBeans:\nInteresting.. Sweet but not grossly sweet like some. Smokey but almost to a crazy level. When I tasted this I honestly felt like I was eating something with a liquid tobacco smoke flavor. It also had a lot of what was probably the BBQ beef in it. Not sure what I thought about this.\n\nPlanned Return Order:\nWings\nSt Louis Ribs\nMac & Cheese\nPotato Salad\nPecan Coleslaw\n\nGet these if nothing else and I would be shocked if you didn't leave grinning ear to ear.\n\nPros:\nGreat Service\nGreat Atmospheric\nAcceptable Great to OK dish ratio\n10% off for yelpsters!\n\nCons:\nAwkward Location\nAwkward Parking\nPricey\n\nFor those still stumped by the \how can fall off the bone be bad\"""" the best test for ribs done correctly would be ribs tender enough to pull apart with your teeth but ones you can pick up and hold by a bone and not have fall apart. If you pick up ribs by the bone and the meat stays on the plate and the bone comes up clean its been neglected. I know this sounds crazy to most but when you have enough ribs done properly you will taste and appreciate a rib that was on as long as it was supposed to be and no longer."""""""
4	Nice homey feeling at this family ran business.  Found it on yelp looking for a place to have some pizza on a side of phoenix I want familiar with.  The pizza was great with its big slices, im a big guy and was filled up after two, but the hot wings stole the show. Nice and crispy just the way we like them with just enough sauce. The service was warm and inviting and we will definitely go back if ever on that side of town again.
5	This place doesn't look like much on the outside and you'll have to disregard the white foldable tables and chairs as you walk inside....but the food is AMAZING.\nThis is Sonora Style Mexican food so keep that in mind.  \n\nHere are my ratings:\n\nMEAT:  I had the Carne Asada tacos.  The carne asada meat was perfect.  It had a slight mesquite smokiness and very flavorful.  The type of meat was Ranchera, which is the ideal type for asada tacos.  The meat was cut against the grain, perfect!\n\nTortillas:  The tortillas are the best!  They're made on site....flour tortillas.  Not that cheap stuff you get at the store with tons of preservatives.  This is the real deal...fresh and tasty.  \n\nSalsa:  The salsa is good.  But it could be great.  I favor the really spicy stuff so for the average salsa person...it will be good.\n\nExtras:  They line the inside of their tacos with Frijoles Puercos.  These are great beans that have ham, pork and a few different types of cheeses mixed in.  If you've never had these type of beans...you've never had beans!  I love how they just add a little to the tortilla and then the meat on top.  It's enough to add even more flavor to the taco but no so much that it overpowers the meat.\n\nThey have your basic cucumbers, salsas, onions and cilantro set up.\n\nYou have to try this place...it's the best tacos in Phoenix!!!
5	What a pleasant surprise!!!\n\nComing in for the birth of our grandchild, we were on a budget.  We\nOriginally booked elsewhere first assuming a golf resort would be out of our budget.  \n\nOur stay at our intended hotel lasted about 5 minutes due to disgusting room and rude staff. As we drove to meet friends for dinner we passed the resort and decided to check rates. To our astonishment the resort was less per night than the scuzzy dirty motel down the road.\n\nThe staff was AMAZING!!!!  From the front desk to security to wait staff I can't believe how helpful, kind and just pleasant every single staff member we met was!!\n\nThe rooms, while in need of updating, we're spotless!  We had a suite in the back with a front door facing a courtyard and a back door to a patio on the greens. The beds were comfy, the front room was complete with a very well appointed kitchen area and even had a stove top.\n\nIf you are expecting a Ritz or The Wyndham you will be disappointed. It is outdated and not stuffy or pretentious like those types of resorts  It is not a luxury resort. It is a clean, comfortable, working mans resort with a warm and comfy staff and stunningly affordable rates. \n\nWe will stay here again and recommend it highly.
1	"""I'm a big fan of Schlotzkys, so you can imagine my disappointment when I was confronted by a rude old man at the register about my signature being worn off the back of my debit card.\n\n\Eh, it's time to get a new card huh? Technically I shouldn't take this.\""""\n\nAs if I should feel grateful that he uses the same card that everyone else does to take money from MY account for MY lunch. It just went downhill from there. When I explained that I hadn't signed it, but written \""""See ID\"""" on it, he almost refused to take it. He was short tempered, rude and snobbish. And it was the same sort of attitude and snide commentary the first time I went here.\n\nI won't be going back. I don't need to be insulted and treated like an inconvenience with my lunch. Shame too, it's the only one within two miles of my home."""""""
2	This place looks nicer from the outside than it is. It's full of mainly low-end retail stores in the main building, as well as chain restaurants flanking it. For the frugal, this might be a treasure trove, as there are many outlets for cheap buys. It's hardly a destination and it's frequently a zoo. The strangest aspect of it is that it's just a stone's throw away from the 180 Biltmore Center. If you need clothes, you're on a tight budget and don't mind stores that are virtually torn apart from rabid shoppers, this is a destination. For tourists or people who want to enjoy a day out on Camelback Road, this is bypass shopping center.
5	Bought a 1/4 cow and was amazed with the quality.  I am an avid grass fed beef eater and absolutely give Date Creek Ranch 5 stars.\n\nThe steaks were tender, delicious and had a very nice color to them.  \n\nAdditionally they added some liver to our order as per request.  They weren't sure if they could do that but when we got home we were surprised to see 4lbs of liver in our package!!!\n\nSecondary bonus:  When we thaw the meat it didn't leak juice from the packages
4	"""OH I love this place! The charm of it is irresistable!! You have to get the little \finger sandwiches\"""" and the sundae's are yummy! They have so many to choose from!  Also..my very FAVORITE item on the menu is the banana nut bread with cream cheese in the center and then another piece of banana nut  bread on top..mmmmmmmmmmm OMGosh , it is soooo yummmy!! the best....and its just so cute...and a great place to cool off and get out of the heat of the day!"""""""
1	"""I need to preface this review with one statement. \n\nI used to love the food. I used to be a regular here and told just about anyone that would listen how good it was.\n\nHere is the bad. I was eating lunch here one day and broke a tooth on a bone or large piece gristle. I was not just a chipped tooth, but an actual break. I informed Dan Maldonado, the owner, before I left. He was seemed genuinely concerned and cooperative.  I went directly to the dentist and was informed it would need  a crown.  A few days later I went to Tacos Atoyac to discuss this with Dan . He was the exact opposite and informed me that his cousin was a lawyer (big deal) and that it was up to me to prove it happened there. Well, I gave Dan the benefit of the doubt and let him know I was not there to shake him down. Really, all I wanted was an apology and a little help with the dental costs, which amounted to over $1,000. I left my card and waited a couple of weeks for a call.\n I never expected him to cover all of it, or even half of it. I was looking for a little acknowledgement.  I never got it. I stopped by a couple of times and Dan was either \not there\"""" or too busy to talk. I expected more courtesy. To his credit, he offered to buy my burrito the last time I was there. Unfortunately,  it was was weak attempt to make amends. I did not accept, because this was never about money. \n\nAs far as the food, make your own choice, but be careful. It could cost you more than $4.00 and the owner could care less about the repercussions to his customers."""""""
3	I think Rito's is overpriced for what you get. The burritos look huge because they use an over sized tortilla that hides the tiny amount of meat they use so most bites are filled with tortilla not meat. If the green chile burrito I ordered was filled with meat then maybe it would be worth $8. The beans were above average and I thought their salsa was amazing even though they charge 25 cents for two tablespoons of it. I expected to be blown away by the food here but it tasted just like the food I grew up eating. It made me want to hug my mom :)
5	Ah-mayyyyy-zing food! I love this place. We were regulars at the Queen Creek location. We went once or twice a month and never had a bad meal. I would go just for their chips and salsa alone - they're home made and delicious. But everything else is great too. I'm addicted to the shredded beef tacos. And the nachos are incredible. And the restaurant itself was beautiful, especially in the spring with the scent of orange blossoms in the air. We were completely bummed when we arrived one night to eat and found it closed down. Then a few weeks/months later we happened to be driving down Elliot Road and we saw the El Rico's sign - woohoo!! Since then, we've been just a few times as it's a bit of a drive. But we go every chance we get, and the food is just as amazing as it was at their Queen Creek location. The new restaurant is quite nice, kid-friendly, with a patio and live music sometimes. And the service is friendly and welcoming. We're so happy to have found the new location. I would recommend El Rico's to anyone.
4	We stopped in for a quick breakfast on our way to Taliesin West.  My wife ordered an egg bagel with strawberry cream cheese and I opted for a breakfast burrito.  Her bagel was amazing, probably one of the best I've tried in years.  They had a great variety both of bagels and spreads.  The breakfast burrito was huge and quite tasty.  I wish though they had a half sized burrito as I ended up only needing about half of it.  It had a hefty price too at $7 but it was monster big.\n\nWe were disappointed in the coffee though.  My wife ordered an iced espresso mocha and it had a strong scorched taste.  I'm not sure if we caught them on a bad batch but it was enough of a disappointment to knock off a star for what is clearly a great local bagel joint.\n\nService was good and quick.  We were in and out in just minutes.  I definitely would recommend this place and would come back.  I'm certain the coffee is normally better.
5	"""Kick ass fries.   No more McCrappy meals for me ever again!!!\n\nWent through the drive through, got my food and started driving away. Started to eat the fries and went \hmmm something different about them\"""".  They were perfect! Potatoes, oil, salt, that's it. Not the tiniest bit of grease on my hands or the bag and cooked perfectly.\n\nThe burger was the best fast food burger I have ever had, seriously.  Again, they keep it simple.  Toasted bun, tasty meat and not greasy at all. How'd they do that?\n\nPeople, next time you need fast food, and I know you all eat it don't lie, go here and see for yourself.   The chains are crap, this place does it right, and it's a cool find your friends don't know about."""""""
4	I went with my partner and I to this Gay owned restaurant where the service is superb.  E-san in Thailand is the poorest district of Thailand but the food is superb.  Since I know the owner, he gave me the spicy Indonesian Chili which is so hot neither my partner and I can eat it but it was a special treat for both of us.  It is as Authentic as it gets.  The price is rather high but every penny is worth it.  They also give money to various of charities which is a big plus which few local restaurant do.  You will also find the Thai selfless service here which is does not exist in the west at this place.  That said, the decors is very strange but I was treated like a VIP.
4	Went to Eddie's House last night to celebrate my dad's 70th birthday.  Overall a great experience.  We arrived a little before our reservation time but were seated promptly.   We were quickly greeted by the server and she was able to answer any questions we had about the menu.   There were four in our party and the items we ordered were:  mint pesto lamb chops, hummus platter, iceberg wedge salad, diver scallops, meatloaf, new york strip, chicken with the asiago creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes.  We also had a great bottle of cabernet suggested by the server (I forgot the name, however, but it was one of their specialty wines).    We also had pre-dinner cocktails and I had their Mai-Tai.    It was one of the best I've ever had.  The food was very good quality and not too salty.   The only complaint by some of our party members were that the lamb did not have enough mint flavor (I don't eat lamb so I did not try them).   The iceberg wedge did not have enough carmelized onions or blue cheese dressing and crumbles.  We had to ask for extra blue cheese and were charged an extra fee.   These are the only reasons for the four stars.  Overall a good experience.   It would have been better if Eddie visited our table.  He was there and visited with most of the tables but not ours.    We're not sure why.   We were in a corner, maybe he couldn't make it over that far.   Overall a great place and I would go back.   Nice atmosphere too.
3	This review is for Sidewinder.  When I play Dinosaur Mountain later this summer, the rating is subject to change.\n\nThe Sidewinder golf course itself is probably worthy of four stars.  The course was interesting enough, but there were a few quirks about the place that drops its rating a bit.\n\nFirst, the practice facility was a bit odd.  Next to the clubhouse is a driving range with mats, with no drivers allowed, and the putting green has targets, and not holes.  By the looks of the aerial view a la Google Maps, however, there might be a *real* practice area on the opposite side of the driving range.  If so, they should probably have advertised it.\n\nSecond, the greens were a bit slow and bumpy.  It looks like they were plugged only a couple weeks before we played.  An aerification warning would have been nice.  Besides that, the course was in great shape.\n\nFinally, and this is my biggest complaint, there was NO WATER ON THE COURSE.  In ARIZONA.  During SUMMER.  I consider this utterly absurd, and almost dropped it to two stars for this unfortunate fact alone.  I have played some pretty crappy golf courses, but this might be the only one I've played without water on the course.  Even municipals usually have gross water fountains.  You can BUY water, of course.  And they'll give you tap water at the turn if you ask for it.  But this is ridiculous.
4	Went to Furio for Martini & Manicures on a Monday night.  Awesome concept and great hook price.  I honestly loved it and will totally go back again for the event.  A couple of things to keep in mind before going: 1... you need to plan to spend the entire night there.  You just don't walk in and get a martini while having a manicure and walk out, you sit down and get a number and wait for the manicure (we waited about 2 hours).   2...  plan on having dinner.  They have a reasonable dinner menu special for Monday night and it's good to pass the time while waiting for the manicure (and to sober you up while drinking the martini's).  3... Bring a couple of singles for tip for the manicure.  \nDefinitely would recommend the event to anyone looking for a fun girls night out on a Monday!!
2	"""This place is pretty ridiculous.  A friend scheduled an appointment here without doing any research as to what he was scheduling.  I didn't realize it was on the Waterfront... had I known this... maybe I would have assumed the following.\n\nAll of the frames are ridiculously overpriced as they do not stock anything that is not designer.  The cheapest frames ended up being Prada frames, if that tells you anything.  Further, the selection is really limited, not providing a lot of choice for different styles.  \n\nThe Sales girl was a typical optical sales person- trying really hard to pitch stuff that, after 17 years of wearing glasses, I know is not necessary (anti-glare lenses ... had both anti-glare and regular... really no difference other than a $75 mark up).  I understand it's her job but even after realizing we were on a budget, she wouldn't give up.  Further, she pulled the doctor back out of his office to make him try to help her with the pitch.  Salegirl: \Doctor, is he going to need these for driving?\""""  Doctor: \""""Oh, yes.\""""  Salesgirl: \""""See, you're really going to need the anti-glare\""""... etc.  \n\nIf you're okay with all designer prices... how about not being able to try on any lenses without having the salesperson get them out of the glass case?  They try to add to their \""""prestige\"""" image by keeping everything under locked glass but it's really just not very user-friendly as you feel awkward asking them to take pairs out again and again if you're stuck between choices.  \n\nEven with full VSP vision insurance that covered the exam and a base rate on the frames and lenses (which couldn't cover anything in the store), we left spending $300 out of pocket.  \n\nWouldn't recommend this place to anyone... too expensive, limited selection, too much of a hassle, too pushy.  They get 2 stars instead of 1 because the doctor was friendly and professional."""""""
5	This is MY store. Not yours, or your neighbors, or her mom's, but MINE. \n\nI love shopping at Trader Joe's. They carry plenty of bagged meals for two people that you can just heat up and eat. They aren't full of awful chemicals like at the grocery store, either. The people who work here are very friendly, and I don't get stressed out shopping here like I do at Safeway or Fry's, plus most things are cheaper. They seem to constantly run out of the Thai Chicken Noodle Salad though... not sure why they don't order more. Every time they get it in, people buy 5 or 6 boxes of it.
4	This is one hell of a grocery store...if you can even call it that. It's more of a grocery mall. \n\nThey have practically everything here and they make it look good too. Is this a convenient and easy place for a quick stop? No, but it certainly is impressive. \n\nSome of my personal favorites so far:\n-fresh bread from the bakery\n-quite the cheese selection\n-sushi made on the spot (Chris loves it anyway)\n-their produce just looks pretty (and tastes fresh)\n-the neatness and organization of the store\n-the premade fresh meals (chicken and veggie kabobs made for me!)\n\nIt's not going to be a regular stop for me (a bit too far from my place and a bit too large), but it certainly seems to have it all. Good work Fry's people.
4	Fun to hangout here during Sunday football! Also fun place to watch baseball games on TV. It can get pretty busy before the PHX teams have home games, but other than that it's pretty decent. They have great specials on Sunday morning/afternoons on beer, Bloody Marys and Mimosas. Sandwiches are great. If you haven't tried the Traverse City wings you haven't LIVED! Service is decent, not the best downtown, but certainly not the worst. I find if you sit at the bar you'll get more attention than at a table when it gets busy.
4	I really liked this place, and haven't had anything quite like it. \n\nWhen my colleague first suggested it - a place that combined Chinese & Mexican - I was intrigued. Then he mentioned it was featured on the Food network. Sure, I was in. \n\nSince I had no expectations going in (how could I possibly expect anything? I had no idea how you could combine these two cuisines), I was quite pleased with the result. I got the Jade Red chicken and the Pollo Diablo, and loved both!
4	i love, love, LOVE fro-yo! this place is smart in that they keep the sample cups behind the counter. they have a handful of different yogurt flavors...including red velvet. however, i thought it was a bit too chocolate-y. my favorites were the original tart flavor and taro flavor. they have a variety of toppings as well including cookie dough and cheesecake bites! i'm a creature of habit and always get my fro-yo with fresh strawberries, mango, and mochi. its the perfect snack on an excruciatingly hot day. =)
5	Love my Ring! Great Job on resizing it. Patrick was not there when I picked it up, be he called me on the date when they said it would be done, and he told me it was ready to be picked up. The quoted me $50 and that is what I was charged. The quality and craftsmanship seem outstanding so far. I am very happy with my decision to go here. It was a great recommendation for me from a friend, and I am and will recommend them to others.
4	My wife and I dined here for Valentines Day 2009.. Our first visit here. We have both dined at Bloom another of Fox Concepts places.. The menu for V-Day was a prix-fix... I had the Winter Squash Soup (basically was a butternut squash soup), perfectly seasoned with Chive Creme fraiche on top.. My wife enjoyed the warm Brie.. For our dinners she had the Pork Chops in merlot demi and I had the Beef tenderloin with a Green peppercorn demi.. Very good and cooked and seasoned to perfection.. \n\nThe deserts is where I am negative.. I had the Boca Negra Cake which should be left of the menu.. It is a 2nd rate chocolate cake that my 4 year old nephew could do better.. It was heavy and dry and lacking in real flavor..  My wife enjoyed the Lemon Sorbet with Pistachio biscotti.. \n\nI had a glass of of the Madrigal petite Sirah.. For a $15.00 glass of wine, which was good, not outstanding, the price point should be lowered to $10.00 a glass or even $8 or $9.. $15 is too much!! \nMy first overall impression is the food is cooked to order. Taste is great.. For the first time in awhile, I didn't reach for the S & P... We will try it again, so we can sample other offerings on the real menu.
1	I had a coupon for another place that apparently closed, so we wound up here.  Oops.  We thought other names for the place might be:  China Minimum.  China Don't.  China Ridden Hard And Put Away Wet.\n\nThe service was nice enough but nothing else was.  The lipstick on the spoon that came with my daughter's egg drop soup pretty much set the tone.  The veggie chow fun and the veggie fried rice were sub-unremarkable.  The baby corn was overly large (we called it toddler corn) and had a musty flavor.  Ug.  The chow fun tasted mostly of soy sauce.  The veggie fried rice was OK.  Oh, we started with crab puffs.  They were overly oily and had no crab flavor.\n\nJust call it China Don't and leave it at that.
4	In a million years, I never would have stopped here on my own. A coffee shop in Chandler Municipal Airport? No way. But my dad is a private pilot and was visiting from San Jose. To appease him, I agreed to try it for breakfast, fully expecting to get a plate of grease. (He loves to east at McDonald's)  He said he goes to coffee shops at small airports all the time and he loves the food and opportunity to watch the planes takeoff/land.\n I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. Except for the hash browns being a bit greasy, the eggs and bacon and toast were really good. The service was friendly and fast and the atmosphere was actually pretty fun. Cozy (crowded) but fun. They even have some great souvenirs you can buy. I am shocked to be saying this, but I will be back.  I am not a huge plane fan, but the food is worth returning for.
5	Gravy to my train. Bow to my wow. Meow to my mix. This place is awesome! Just ask my dog. \n\nI brought Lucas here as a referral and because he needed some tests, he ended up staying until I was able to pick him up at the end of my work day. The vet techs [and all the staff] who work there are crazy sweet - two brought him up to me when I picked him up and both were telling me what a great dog he is. And my boy Lucas, although always preferring to be at my side, is happy here. He does not turn to run. He smells, he gets love and has gotten treatment from Dr. Newland that has literally brought him back to life. \n\nDr. Newland explains the treatment options and any potential affects. He follows up and calls when he says he will. On one occasion I asked for a different medication for a rescued cat and he called me to discuss my options. In my previous experience, the vet wouldn't call, they'd give another prescription to the front desk and have them call. No matter. Pick an experience here - they've all been great. I am so grateful to be able to be confident that my animals are receiving the best possible care. As another reviewer points out, its what we'd want for ourselves as well. \n\nThank you too Kristi and Kimber especially, for always being so so kind no matter what kind of morning frenzy I'm having.
5	Every time I go to Scottsdale, I have to come here for dinner.  Since it is only about once a year, I HAVE to have the BBQ Salmon!  It is consistantly awesome, I promise.  We start with the queso dip and the iron skillet corn bread but honestly that salmon is a star and believe me I usually choose steak over fish.  This is a winner.  Where I live we have Houstons and I have pleaded with them to have the corn bread, cheese dip and BBQ salmon put on the menu.  They have declined...pity.
5	These guys are great. Ever since O'reilly took over the service is awesome.\n\nI know almost nothing about cars, except when they break it costs too much. The guys at this store have helped me find what I need, & even helped me find a great deal or two.\n\nTonight was the pinnacle of fabulous service. I stopped for gas across the street, & my car refused to start. What a piece of crap huh? It's like 30 degrees out. A great friend's husband came & got my battery charged so I could drive over to O'reilly. They tested my battery, determined it was a goner, & then offered to install the new one after I bought it. The guy stood out in the cold with my friend's awesome husband & they replaced my battery. They do not charge for this at all!\n\nWhat a great business model, they have actual good customer service!\n\nThe logo is a disaster, but who cares with such great service.
4	Me and my wife have a membership to the zoo - and well - would totally recommend it to everyone.  we use it all the time - heck i would go every week if she would let me.  there is just something about sitting at the zoo - in the weather - with the people  - enjoying the day.\n\nnot all animals look happy there, or comfortable for that matter, but some really do look like they are oblivious that they are at the zoo.\n\nit is a huge zoo - it would take most the day to see all of it.  it is so relaxing to just go for a coulpe of hours and then leave.\n\nwe have been where we didn't see anyone for 20 minutes, and on the busiest day and never felt that there were crowd problems.\n\nthe zoo does does seem to do too much to just want your money - you pay a good fee to get in and then there are places everywhere to take more money from you - opportunity cost eh.\n\nmy current favoirtes are the big horn sheep up in the corner - and just sitting and watching the movement at the savana.  it is like my crack.\n\nsome people sit by the pool and relax - i site by the savana and relax
4	Odd place. But, they nicely do the job and that's what is important.\n\nThe staff is nice. Place definitely looks like a hole in the wall. Despite the hair all over the place it's pretty clean. \n\nThey follow your instructions with what you'd like done to your dog. \n\nPrices are cheap, and that is why we switched from petsmart. For $30 less we are getting the same grooming service for our dog.\n\nYou drop off in the morning around 8-9 & usually the dog is done by 1. They don't necessarily call when the dog is ready, but that's ok for me. I'm so busy I usually stop by at 1:30 or 2 and our dog is always ready, and looking and smelling nice.
4	I used to eat at the lone Baja Fresh in Raleigh, NC before it closed, so I was excited to finally be able to eat some of their fish tacos once again.  They were as good as I remembered them being too! I got a grilled and a crispy fish taco.  Both were good, but the grilled was probably the better of the two.  The atmosphere is pretty standard fast food style with fairly plain decor, but don't let that make you think the food isn't worth it.  The service was friendly and the food came out quickly.
4	The service is pretty standard for a cheap vietnamese restaurant - not particularly friendly.\n\nIf you can deal with that, the food is incredibly cheap and delicious. I order the ca kho to (carmelized catfish) - my boyfriend said this smelled and looked awful, but I love fish and this was really tasty. It was also like 2.5 meals worth for under $7.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the veggie rice noodle dish - he wasn't a huge fan of the veggie mix (cabbage, onions, bok choy and carrots) but I thought it was really good. The gravy/sauce they stir try it in is really tasty.\n\nDefinitely will be back!
4	Roka was pretty good, i recommend getting sashimi here based almost soley on the fact that they give you fresh ground wasabi with it!!! i have a love affair for horse radish so um, yeah i enjoyed the wasabi from that.\n\nVery good food, but to be honest it better for being at the price range it was at.\n\nThe server was good and friendly. This place has a more laid back atmosphere and so there really isn't a server breathing down your neck all the time trying to bombard you with service. They show up at the correct time and always are willing to help you if you need it. \n\nWe had a spider roll, dynamite, the korean pork belly with kimchi, and yellowtail sashimi.\nThe spider roll was the better of the two rolls.  They gave us an aioli sauce with the spider roll, that really had no benefit to the dish at all. It was there but didn't add anything special.\nOn the Dynamite it was actually dissapointing. The Scallops were sliced soo thinly ontop that it was virtually not there. Couldn't taste it and it ended up just being just an EHHH type of roll. I'd pass on that next time.  The Korean Pork Belly was really good, it had a nice and might i say beautiful char on it which not only provided a great smokey flavor (not burnt flavor mind you), but also gave it the characteristic we all wish for... the melt in your mouth. I'd definitely would want to get this dish again. Putting a piece of the home made kimchi on it with a bite was a winner. Home-made kimchi was impressive because i wasn't expecting too much from it. Definitely was NOT my favorite kimchi, but it was a lot better than i thought it would be. \nLastly as i eluded to earlier the sashimi was not only cut beautifully and fresher than other places i've had, but it was served with fresh ground wasabi. should i say more? too bad i will, I LOVE fresh ground wasabi. I seriously just started eating it by itself, don't regret it at all. Honestly an amazing experience on the sashimi part. \n\nI'd come back definitely and hope to some time.
4	Any review of Delux requires an obligatory mention of the Los Angeles landmark restaurant Father's Office, whose concept was all but completely plagiarized by Delux. I always say, though, it doesn't matter who came up with the idea, it matters who executes it. And, I like how Delux executes the concept. High-end burgers, delicious craft beer selection and great service in a cozy (and hip) location.\n\nOf course, I have to be the weirdo -- I am also a vegetarian, so I can't have a burger anyway. Instead, I grabbed the amazing grilled cheese, which they grill panini-style, cut into quadrants. The baguette, as usual, was perfectly toasty, firm, yet chewy. There is a great variety of craft beers -- everything from Alaskan Amber to Stone IPA. The service is always good, although this time our server was particularly flirty. He actually sat down with my dining companions and I to chit chat. It was charming and fun and certainly added to the fun (and enjoyment) of the meal.\n\nAnother mandatory purchase at Delux is the fries -- available in sweet potato, regular, or half and half. The fries are served in a mini shopping cart (familiar to anyone who has been to Father's Office). They are perfectly seasoned and served with a delicious aioli dipping sauce.\n\nDelux is a perfect place to have a sandwich and day drink on a warm afternoon, and I am looking forward to the temperature cooling off so I can waste a few Sundays there. And, of course, Delux is open till 2 a.m., so it is a great option for late nights as well.
4	Funky, lots of personality, friendly service, and good food at the restaurant.  Is a little broken down, and as such is not really worth the $250 a night we paid for it.  I've stayed at the Standard (LA & NYC), and in Townhouse (Miami) and many kimptons at similar rates, with much more polish.  And by polish, i mean, as others mentioned, no cracked paint, clean bathtubs, toilets that work, etc.  But, it really does have personality, and we were very happy there.
5	I love Steve's.  Having been here twice now, I feel safe with my conclusion.\n\nSteve's Espresso is tucked away on the side of an obscure strip mall in Tempe.  Most don't even know it is here, which is perfect for an increasingly anti-social nerd like myself.\n\nThe atmosphere is a little bit different, too.  While it is like most coffee shops, it is a bit simpler and the music is a bit different.  All of which add to my liking of this place. \n\nLet's not forget the coffee.  While I can admit I may have had better coffee at other places, the espresso at Steve's is very delicious.  And for some reason, I have noticed their Mocha tends to give me a bit more motivation than most places.  \n\nI thank @bwilley for having a meeting with me here, because it is now a new fav.
5	Vegan breakfast have always been available to me at this friendly coffee shop upon request, but now they have incredibly tasty options on the actual menu! Their vegan cupcakes are one of my motivational tools, when I need an extra push forward I allow myself one after the goal is achieved.  It can get busy so if you are in a hurry, don't panic at the line, the friendly and efficient service staff will get everyone's order taken and made before you can absorb all the local color on display.
2	I am a HUGE Chipotle fan! I go all the time and really enjoy the convenience and quality meal I can get on the go. With that said I will tell you that this location has definitely scarred me. I still love Chipotle, but I don't think I can ever eat at this one again. I know stuff happens, bur I've had 2 incidents here. \n\nThe first was about a year ago... I was enjoying my usual chicken burrito bowl and as I went in for another bite I noticed something moving. YES MOVING! Their was some sort of green creature enjoying  lunch with me! Needless to say lunch was over for me. I took the bowl up to the counter and showed the manager and they immediately apologized and offered me a new bowl and a gift card for a free burrito. I will say that I think the manager was very attentive and handled the situation well, but I couldn't bring myself to come back for a few months. \n\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago. I was grabbing a quick dinner with a friend and as I reached for my next bite I realized the chicken didn't look quite right...It was not fully cooked! I began to inspect the meat and decided my meal was definitely over. It was the same situation, the manager was nice and apologetic, but I was seriously grossed out. \n\nUnfortunately this Chipotle was super convenient, but I don't foresee any meals here anytime soon.
5	I LOVE this place! From the moment you walk up to the door, it is spotless. Sometimes you will be approached by an employee asking if you need assistance, majority of the time, you won't talk to one employee, which is great! I just want to go in, get what I need, and peace out until next time without the small chatter. \n\nTheir hummus is AMAZING, along with a few of the prepackaged meals. Their Creamy Cilantro Salad Dressing is OMG AMAZING!!\nSweet tea... LOVE IT!!
4	"""Guys, skip applebees, this is where to take a lady. It's not expensive, there's delicious bruchetta and salads disguised as \trendy\"""" \""""light\"""" food, and great drinks. It's very laid back and the service is very accommodating and fun. Here you'll see small groups of girls/women dining, and a multitude of couples. I definitely recommend the bruchetta and grab a glass or two of wine. \nThey have a large screen playing movies (last time I was in it was playing Lebowski...so PLUS!) and the whole ambiance/design/decor what have you is relaxing, rustic, and unique. A great place for lunch or dinner. They also had some good tunes playing. Very urban rustic casual...if that even makes sense. check it out!"""""""
5	"""Sens+Friday Night=Good times!\n\nSo my girl and I figured we would walk to dinner this past Friday to one of the many new hip, downtown spots...couldn't have been a better choice for us to make!\n\nSens was excellent, our waitress (don't wanna try and spell her name for fear of butchering it.) was amazing, wonderful knowledge of the menu...you could tell she adored the food, so we went with it....we didn't order a single thing....just said \bring us more\""""...and boy was that the right call!!\n\nSIDE NOTE: I LOVE small plates....I think more places should take this route!  I mean come on....why settle for tasting one or two items when you can have six?  Yeah, I thought you'd agree :)\n\nAs I sat there...admiring the beautifully appointed decor...drinking my signature chile infused \""""Hot and Dirty\"""" martini (yes it is hot...and quite dirty...very tasty!)  I realized wow...this is the best duck I've ever tasted...really, \""""must try's\"""" here include (besides the hot and dirty martini) Ginger Mint Duck salad...and my favorite of the night...the Soup Goyza, an amazing, melt in your mouth dumpling with a mixture of pork and cabbage in a broth...absolutely amazing!!\n\nSIDE NOTE #2: ANY joint that's not afraid to play a little Puscifer is ok in my book...DJ's a great call here!  Oh....and not for nothing....the red light in the bathroom is kewl and make sure you DON'T miss the painting on the right as you pass through the red curtain...very HOT!!\n\nConclusion....run, don't walk to this one, you won't be disappointed!!"""""""
3	I have been by this spot many times and I needed a place to eat lunch so I stopped in... I entered the restaurant and was seated right away. But then I sat there for a good 10 minutes and watched the workers walk around  then I got to see the owners little kid decide she was going to sit with the consumers in the booth a head of me... Then the kid started crying and it just does not need to happen I was kind of shocked please leave your kids at home if they are not working at the restaurant.  I ended up getting up and asking the staff if I could just get the lunch buffet. I got a bit of everything to try I enjoyed the rice and the chicken dishes... The fish dishes on the other hand not so good the fish puffs were cold and not good and the one fish dish super fishy tasteing. The bread was really good that came with the meal... So all in all I would say I will not be going back anytime soon nothing to write home about.
3	As a fan of Nordstrom Rack I thought I'd check out Last Call after a fruitless night at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Last Call isn't really a bargain store but the items are heavily discounted. If you walk in expecting to pay retail prices than you won't be disappointed.  For example a hoooot pair of Christian Dior  f*ck me high heels in fuschia were discounted from $600 to $275.  While that's  half off I wouldn't call that cheap.  There are plenty of  beautiful housewares that made me wish my cats didn't destroy everything. Designer handbags are also aplenty at this store, including Cynthia Rowley, Gryson, and a slew of other trendy designers.
5	Beautiful resort. Beautiful restaurant. Beautiful company.  And, of course, beautiful food.  My experience at Wright's was nothing short of perfection. Starting off with the service: attentive and professional, exactly what I would expect.  I ordered the Chef's tasting menu with wine pairings; a 3-course menu that somehow turned into 5.  The amuse was poached shrimp with a smoked corn and tomato relish, it was perfectly balanced and the smokiness of the corn complemented the sweetness of the shrimp.  Next was the asparagus soup.  I love asparagus anyway, but I LOVED this soup.  Thick and creamy, with pieces of asparagus and bacon, and a nicely poached egg sitting right on top.  The egg yolk added so much richness and depth to the dish.  Following the soup was probably my favorite dish of the night: a seared duck breast on a bed of prosciutto, tangelos, and a salad of petite greens tossed in a tangelo vinaigrette.  This dish was amazing; beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.  My entree was a heaping bowl of lobster rigatoni with green onions and English peas. Everything in the dish worked; the pasta was al dente, the lobster was rich and tender, and the sauce was delicious.  Dessert was the only disappointment of the meal, albeit a small one.  A macaroon tasting plate.  It was good, just not what I would expect from a restaurant like Wright's.  I left Wright's feeling fat, happy, and a little tipsy; everything I hope to get out of a meal when I go out.
5	I don't write many reviews, and I generally don't like letting my favorite secret places out of the bag, but I love linda's on osborn breakfast!  I eat breakfast every weekend, all over the valley, and this is one of my favorite simple spots.  If you want to be at Daily Dose or Breakfast Club (not that the food isn't good there) to people watch and 'be seen', this is not your place.  If you want incredible value and delicious food - jackpot!  As a Texas transplant, this is some of the best chicken fried steak and eggs you will find in AZ (I actually discovered this place after Ranch House Grill burned down). The breakfast potato's are the icing on the cake, best in town hands down, but be careful, they're addictive!  Linda is a very nice, hardworking lady who is always there.  For great homemade food, you will NOT be disappointed!
5	This sushi place was designed for me. Really affordable sushi all the time (why do rolls have to triple in price because it's not between 5-7pm). Good quality sushi. Great drink prices all the time. \n\nMy girlfriend took me here recently, again one of those places that are facebook famous for me, as in I've seen friends check in and post pics of plates stacked high but I've never gone. Our check in even got 2 comments of why we didn't invite them! \n\nWe had about 6-7 plates between ourselves and were stuffed. Also we ordered a sakibomber and for $5 (yes five dollars!) we got a large Sapporo beer and saki. Needless to say I had to give up my keys after finishing that. \n\nOur total bill came up to about $25 with tip. I actually can't wait to come back again and you're all invited next time I promise!
4	I haven't been in an FYE for a long time.  I enjoyed having the time to look around in this one on the way home from Phoenix. They have all the CD's and DVD's very organized and are very helpful and knowledgeable.  They also have a lot of tie-in merchandise from movies.  I found a Broadway CD with songs from various shows and one other CD (blanking on the artist).  Both were pretty inexpensive. \n\n I was looking for a certain used movie and they had it but it was $14.99 so I decided to pass.  It was one I'd probably only watch once so I'll just rent it or wait for it to come on HBO.
4	"""Really good ribs and brisket. I like them best without the bbq sauce. The ribs are meaty and moist. The brisket melts in  your mouth and their red potatoes could be considered comfort food. Their regular bbq sauce is a bit to spicy for me and their \sissy\"""" sauce is too tangy. I prefer a sweeter sauce or just a dry rub.\n\nIf you go, plan ahead because there is usually long lines at peak meal times. It's a stand in line, order at the counter, food served in a paper wrapping then in a deep tray type of place. Picnic table style seating.\n\nThere's plenty left to take home and the leftovers are even better!"""""""
1	You know that feeling you get when you wait for something all day? That's the feeling we got as we waited to get our white pie from Rosati's. You know that feeling you get when you finally get it and it is a major disappointment? That's the feeling we got after we got our white pie from Rosati's. \n\nWhen we got it home, it turned out to be on a crust similar to melba toast, very dry and crumbly. We thought it felt kind of light when we picked it up, but didn't check, as we should have. We never ordered the cracker crust, but that's what we got. The pizza had nearly no flavor, and was quite oily. Strike one. \n\nYou have to have a degree in mechanical engineering to get the box open. When we finally got the box open, we found that the pie was cut into little rectangles instead of regular slices. Not a huge deal, but strike two. \n\nHere is the worst part of this whole fiasco. Rosati's charged us $22.15 for this mess! There is perhaps $4.00 worth of ingredients in this pizza. They felt that it was good business to tack on an $18 profit! Of course we knew how much the pie was before we ordered it. But we figured that a place that trumpets how long they have been in business, and has the incredible audacity to charge nearly as much for a pizza as dinner for two at Ruby Tuesdays, would make a pie that was spectacular. That did not turn out to be the case. An awful experience which we will never do again. Strike three.\n\nYou will do much better going to Fatman's (Chicago style) on the Trail, or Ray's Pizza. Far better pizza at prices that are not comically insane.
3	So much has been written about Pizzeria Bianco that we had to give it a try, regardless of wait time. Fortunately, we decided to go there during an off hour, around 3:30 pm on a Saturday. The wait we were told was still an hour. We killed time next door at Bar Bianco but then I wondered why wouldn't they use this space to serve more patrons? Anyways, the wait ended up to be a quick 30 minutes. \n\nThe Wiseguy was what was recommended so I had that (fennel sausage, mozzarella, and onions) and added mushrooms to it. We also ordered the Margherita for the table. Overall, the menu is pretty short and simple. Pizzas came out pretty quickly. The combination of flavors on the Wiseguy was good, but it seemed a bit too oily. The Margherita was a bit more traditional and was good. \n\nStaff was friendly and the ambiance was nice. I liked the waiting area Bar Bianco next door. It was like you were sitting in someone's home. The restaurant itself is small. If you have a large group, good luck.\n\nSo was all this worth the wait? Ummm, not sure 'bout that.
2	As much as I want to love this local restaurant, I just don't.  The staff is wonderful, great selection of drinks, but the food is just...eh.  The American Potato Chips are delicious as are the fries.  But when you venture past that, it gets hit or miss.  The Garlic Chicken Pasta was so greasy I could hardly eat it.  The Classic Philly is great, but the French Dip is (according to my hubby) really doesn't have much taste. \n\nWe'll try again, hoping that they've worked the kinks out of the place.
5	BW'S is a family favorite. That's not just a slogan. My kids are Gluten free and there are not a whole lot of places I can take them for dinner. \nThey can eat the chicken wings no sauce and we are all addicted to their fries. \nI know Gail the owner. She used to have a play kitchen in her restaurant for the kids but unfortunately corporate made her remove it.\nShe tries to create an atmosphere where parents can bring their kids and they don't have to stress out about making them behave like 70 year old ladies. It makes it a little more relaxing for us. \nAnd besides the food I love being able to watch sports while I'm with my family.\nGood Stuff, Thanks Gail
4	I have been going to Tarbell's for years and have never been disappointed.  They have an excellent wine list.\n\nThe food selection is diverse and uniformly excellent.\n\nWhenever I go to Tarbell's I cannot help but remember the time I ordered an Australian Shiraz.  I think the food server got confused when he heard me remark to my companion that the Penfolds Grange was one of my all time favorite wines.  By mistake he brought the Grange, which was selling for $450 a bottle. After I told him he brought the wrong bottle, he started to walk back to the wine cellar and dropped the bottle of Grange, which shattered, spilling all that great shiraz over the restaurant's floor.\n\nI hope he did not have to pay for his accident.
4	I was super excited when I heard sprinkles was coming to town!  But I was a bit disappointed after tasting and tasting and tasting!  I tried just about every flavor they had when they first opened over a period of a month (it's a surprise my pants still fit after that).  And I just felt like their cake was too dry, OR too oily.  \n\nBUT, recently I went back to give it another try since I now work so close by.  Oh my god they have improved!  Whatever kinks they had they worked them out!  I LOVE almost all of their flavors.  The chocolate marshmallow, banana, coconut (my favorite) chocolate coconut, mocha, black and white, etc etc.  I die.  \n\nBut I will say I wish they would go a little lighter on the frosting.  Some frosting still tastes a little like plastic, but their chocolate and cream cheese frosting are to die for.
5	I bought a voucher for my Boyfriend to have laser hair removal on his neck.  Went with him to his first appointment, with Sabina, and was so impressed I purchased a package for laser hair on the back of my neck to get rid of those unruly frizzy hairs and also purchased a package for brazilian laser hair removal. \n\nMy Boyfriend has had two treatments on his neck and already noticing the difference, I have just started with one treatment and will update again after a couple more times.\n\nAfter telling my Mom how much I liked this place we set up a consultation with Michelle and are going this Friday (August 24th) to have our first Pixel Laser treatment.\n\nSo far I have met  Sabina, Kaye and Michelle and all 3 of them have been wonderful.  I have had laser hair removal treatments in the past and always felt like a number, not a customer.  The ladies at Skin Gravy treated me like a friend and made us all feel welcome.\n\nI highly recommend this place.\n\nKim B.
2	I was made aware of Mickey's Hangover in Scottsdale when I first moved out here because my husband and I are both Ohio State alums, and Mickey's is THE bar to watch Ohio State games on Saturdays.  It's almost like being in Columbus, but with blue skies and warm weather.\n\nThe waitstaff is very pleasant during the games, but not extremely fast or attentive. The food is just OK and pretty greasy.  I do enjoy the onion rings, as it compliments my $8 buckets of Bud Light very well.  I 100% do not recommend the sampler platter...we made the mistake of ordering it the first tiime we went to Mickey's. I do believe they have the grossiest mozzarella sticks this side of the Mississippi River. Sorry, but I don't want my mozzarella sticks to come shaped like an eggroll.  And I don't think I've seen anyone drink PBR since my days at Ohio State, but it flows aplenty at Mickey's.\n\nThe decor is laid back with comfy couches up front. The catch during Ohio State games we learned is that you have to reserve the couches. Seriously that is lame.  Our experience at Mickey's during the Ohio State/Michigan game completely turned us off to the establishment and I am not really sure we will be returning in the future.
5	Remember when you were little and you came home to fresh baked cookies?  Me either.  BUT, when you walk into Chocolate Star Bakery's adorable shop, you are immediately transported to that idealistic scent that makes it almost feel like you are 8, waiting for your mom to pour the milk so you can eat the delicious cookie, fresh from the ovens.  \n\nI love anything they make with chocolate and mint, and my kids love the pink clouds--a delicious sugar cookie.   I also love that I can send these as gifts-- I love supporting local businesses--especially one as cute and friendly as this one!
3	I've been debating on whether or not to give this spot two or three stars.  I used to be a huge fan of everything about the Vig.  Great Patio, Great Bar, Great Food, Great Laughs, but the one thing that was never great was the parking.  They have a valet, but it always seems to be full, so you started to park across the street, well that parking is now always full.\n\nThe Vig has been struck from the list of places that I frequent, because I hate to wait for a table at a neighborhood grill, and because I hate to park a half mile away for a chicken sandwich.\n\nThe Vings (get it...Vig WIngs...Vings) are very good to start off, and every single meal that I have enjoyed is excellent.  They have a rotating beer tap that is usually something delicious, and very enjoyable.  The cocktails are strong, but not too strong.\n\nThe patio is one of the best in town.  They did a great job of giving it character and limiting the view of the crap shopping center across the street.\n\nThis is another great Phoenix establishment in the likes of LGO, Chelsea's, The Parlour, etc, but the parking has turned me off to the point that I don't even think about it any more.  It's such a shame that a great establishment has to be ruined by those in Scottsdale and Tempe that make the drive to our neighborhood grills!!
5	It took a little doing to find a parking space, but when I entered the salon & shop, it was oh-so-worth it.  Shauna made me feel like I was such a special customer, and took my friends' general suggestion of a hairstyle to the next level!   After the wash & condition (what WAS that, my hair has never been softer or more flowing), she worked on my hopeless hair.  And performed a miracle.  My millenial cut has been now brought into the teens, and I could not be happier.  It is superb --  it's now two weeks later -- and it still rocks!\n\nI did not have time to look at the vintage selections, since I was hurried.  But I think they add more to the ambience than the usual stacks of People and RedBook magazines one usual finds.  It would be actually nice to shop while I waited, if that were necessary.\n\nAs for now, though --  I've found my new stylist!
4	"""Dear Pugzie's, \n\nI am going to have to change your name to \Granny's\"""" because your warm bread, soft cookies and delicious homemade soups remind me of a little hug from my miniature pill-poppin' granny. When I'm feeling like I should have packed my own lunch, I'll come see you. The only thing missing is a sweet note written on my lunch napkin.  \n\nToday you made me some brocolli cheese soup, and I snagged a magazine from the community kiosk (US Weekly - summer bathing suits hot-or-not issue) and had myself quite the nice little lunch. \n\n\nThanks for keepin' it real grandma, I'll be back next week for another visit! \n\nLove,\nMIchelle"""""""
2	Beware for cake ordering: \nI ordered a custom cake, and when I arrived for pick up I could not believe the unprofessional appearance of the cake- apparently teenagers decorate these cakes and no adult supervises or checks. The cake had 6 or 8 1/2 oreos on a large rectangle cake, and big block letters with the message with one of letters visibly corrected, so it looked like a brown lump with sparse cookies and ugly lettering- no nice borders around edges like in the pictures online.\nThe manager was not on site and took it 2 days for me to call to reach her; the staff is nice and the kids on staff redecorated a little better, and manager was apologetic.\nEveryone loved the taste of the cake but I would recommend just getting a predecorated cake from the store and write in message yourself since your handwriting is likely better than the decorator on hand.
3	Food- 2.5 Stars\nService-.5 Stars\n\nThis place is great for that Saturday or Sunday morning cure for the hangover.  Their Sunday special for endless bloody mary and memosas is fantastic.  You used to be able to pay $10 for the bloodies and $15 for the memosas however now you have to purchase a breakfast ENTREE as well as the $10 or $15 for the drinks.  I think this is a bit steep, I know you are in Scottsdale but either discount the fee for the booze if you have to buy the breakfast or allow a customer to purchase breakfast entree and drink.  The bloody marys however are very cool...they put all the original fixings but then throw a piece of dried bacon in the center of the glass which is especially helpful if you are trying to cure that hangover we talked about earlier.\n\nThe ambience of the venue is cool very Scottsdale with limited amount of D-bags (except fo your servers which I'll cover in a moment).  Great place for happy hour or to catch a game and can generally find an area to hang out.\n\nThe reason I have not been back to RnR in a while is because the service is absolutely terrible.  I have gone at least 15 times and keep telling myself that next time the service will be better and that I'll try it again however I keep ending up disappointed.  Every time I have been (which is on Sunday for the endless booze) my waiter or waitress walks around pouting and unresponsive the entire time we are there.  I know you were probably out partying the night before and the last thing you want to do is be at work with people ordering booze and booze and breakfast, but if you hate your job so much quit.  I will probably give this place another try simply because their blood marys outweigh the terrible service, but if any MANAGEMENT is reading this they need to do a complete clean out of all their employees and start fresh or this place will eventually close.
4	"""I think I'd really love this place if I came for happy hour or even dinner. I joined a few friends for lunch, and while I liked Cheuvront, I didn't love Cheuvront. And as we all know, there is a big difference between \like\"""" and \""""love.\"""" I think it would take me a few dates and some convincing to fall in love with Cheuvront.\n\nI chose the turkey sandwich for lunch, which had turkey, gruyere and cranberry sauce on grain bread. There was a little too much bread for my liking, but the flavor was good. Overall, though, I thought the choices for lunch were ample. Pizza, sandwiches, pasta, etc.- truly something for everyone. However, I think Cheuvront is probably best enjoyed when taking advantage of their wine selection. I also appreciate the nice parking lot adjacent to the restaurant.\n\nI'd come back to Cheuvront for sure, but I'm definitely not ready for a committed long term relationship yet. And don't even think about saying the \""""m\"""" word."""""""
5	"""Jason's Deli is one of the reasons I regret moving out of Arizona.  The food quality and value are very good, and their service is stellar.  Today as I took a \to go\"""" order out, I glanced at the ice cream machine and the manager came by and said \""""here let me get you a to-go cup for some ice cream.\""""  Great service.\n\nPros:\n+ Great variety of fresh food, always tasty.  I recommend the Smokey Jack Panini and the Turkey Muffalletta.\n+ The sides are also very good.  3 bean salad, soups and a robust salad bar.\n+ Free garlic toast, corn muffins, bran muffins and soft serve ice cream.\n+ Always superior customer service here.  They make me feel like a valued customer every time I come in.\n\nCons:\n- The french onion soup can be oily sometimes.\n- The line at lunchtime can be 20+ people so try to avoid \""""rush hour\"""" if you can.\n\nOverall, I'd give this place six stars if Yelp let me.  A truly great deli restaurant."""""""
5	Only sad part of lunch was that it wasn't the full dinner experience.  We found this place on Yelp while in town for a conference and got to have a deliciously awesome lunch for under $30 for 2.  \n\nWe had a roasted veggie crostini and shrimp+polenta.  Both were perfection. Again, only issue here was that we wanted to sit there for the rest of our vacation and eat everything Chef Chris makes.  Nonstop.\n\nThe space is truly special, as if you are eating in your friends rustic house while they are cooking you up a culinary masterpiece.  The lunch was unforgettable, and we'll have to make it back for hours of evening eating.
3	"""Being partial to Olive&Ivy and Blanco, Sauce and True Foods we decided to embark on a culinary journey to reach the other restaurants within the Fox empire.  Our next port of call was Bloom.\n\nWe went on a fairly quiet Saturday evening and were greeted with good service, enjoyed good drinks, had a good salad, and made our way through good entrees.  Do you see a trend forming?\n\nEverything about the restaurant was good.  Within the very competitive Scottsdale corridor \good\"""" gets you lost in the shuffle.  There really wasn't anything that really stood out.  Even within the Fox family this gets lost in the mix. Therefore we will probably pass on a return visit in favor of something new."""""""
3	Let's talk value.  Their full sized subs are enormous!  Forget a foot long.  These are at least 16 inches.  \n\nService is prompt.  Quality is consistent.  The inside and limited outdoor eating areas are kept clean.\n\nThe food, well....  Ok, so far I've only gotten cold sandwiches and while they've been ok, they aren't anything special.  I always get the wheat bread and it is wonder bread soft every time.  If only I liked that sort of thing.  I prefer a bit more substance, but for some folks I can imagine this would be awesome.  I will say that one of these days I'm going to have to try one of their pastas.  Maybe on a cold day.  But as a devoted al dente girl, I'm hesitant to try pasta from a sub place.  \n\nAt $8 for a whole and $4.50 for a half, I'll most likely be grabbing lunch here more in the future as I work in the area, but if I didn't I wouldn't be going back any time soon.
4	"""This was the perfect place for a lazy, Sunday brunch. Ample light coming through the big windows, the easy-going duo at the register, and the self-service water station (?) with copper mugs hanging on hooks all contributed to the calming, relaxing effect that permeated the relatively small joint (it sits maybe 20?). I had the OMG - prosciutto, mascarpone, and fig on Ciabatta bread. The combination of sweet & savory with the layer of creamy mascarpone and honey to blend the flavors was fantastic, and the texture of bread was really incredible. I would have been happy with just the bread and some soft butter on the side. I wonder if the bread is baked in-house? In any case, I'll definitely be returning for more \wichcraft.\"""" Looking forward to trying their dinner menu too, and supporting a local business while at it. A couple of things I think it can improve on: Unkemptness - it adds to that \""""hanging out at a friend's house\"""" vibe, with crumbs hanging out here and there...but it was a little off-putting for me. And no, I'm no neat freak - I used to troll around east bay eateries all the time, and God knows they're not the cleanest of establishments to say the least. Oh, and the temperature - a tad bit cooler, and it would have been perfect. Maybe it was because the to-go window was being open and shut constantly, but I didn't feel cool enough to want to stick around."""""""
5	What can I say about Slice of Sicily? It's amazing, that's what I can say. Anytime you find a pizza joint that also serves real Italian dinners, and the owners actually operate the place, you are in for great food! They are capable of making a truly mean New York style pie. I typically like sausage on my pizza, but their seasoned hamburger has replaced it as my topping of choice.\nSuffice to say, I have forsaken pizza chains due to the superb quality of the food at Slice of Sicily.
4	I probably wouldn't come here nearly as much if I didn't live right down the street. In all honesty, the food is pretty mediocre. \nHowever, I've found a solution that works pretty well for me: get really drunk, then eat. Four stars for Prickly Pear margaritas and being able to stumble home. \nThe flour tortilla chips are pretty damn good and addicting. However I've noticed a suspicious discrepancy in torilla chip ratio lately, they seem to be hiding more flimsy corn chips in with the flour. Very sneaky and lame. \nAnd Fideo? Yuck. Uh no pasta with my mexican food please, I'll stick with the rice. \nIf anything, get drunk and enjoy the wonderful patio on a nice day. I still haven't tried their brunch yet but they had me at Chocolate Fountain.
3	For a chain, Famous Dave's is pretty good. I'm so anti chain that i would never have gone here..... but we needed something close, and we wanted to terrorize my friend's son who was there working there at the time. There is joy in teasing teenage children, even if they aren't your own... so I went. \n\nThey serve meat, meat and more meat.... with some potatoes and a hunk of corn. Seriously... you get a trashcan lid full of brisket, ribs, chicken parts and a couple of sides... I like the cole slaw and the french fries, but i have heard that they have great mashed potatoes. \n\nPrices are cheap for the quantity, and the quality is good. I've been there 3 times now and i always end up taking some home.. For a chain, this place is pretty good.
2	"""I feel the Days Inn Tempe is best described as \a place where you can purchase the right to sleep for awhile.\"""" \n\nI booked my 10-night stay on Travelocity for a non-smoking room, yet when I entered the room I almost choked. It was disgusting. I've never had a smoking hotel room before and I will make sure I don't again. They said they couldn't move us to a different room.\n\nMy local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew. No big deal, I thought to myself, as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew. Nope. Coors Light it is.\n\nThe towels felt like they were made of cow tongue, and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about $500.\n\nI'm awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days, and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby. The dollar store had a corkscrew."""""""
3	I have some mixed feelings here but am still going to give this place a good rating, mainly because of their breakfast...\n\nThe positives:\n-Really good and not that expensive breakfast\n-The building is designed and decorated in a cool fashion\n-The patio seating with the TV's is really nice.\n-Great central location\n-Lots of pretty girls\n\nThe negatives:\n-Tons of douchebagery... almost overwhelming. By douchebagery I mean Ed Hardy wearing loud mouthed wannabe flashy type people who think they are too cool for school.\n-Service is pretty bad, mainly this blonde dude who I swear to god must have drank paint thinner as a child. I did have 1 out of 3 experiences there with reasonable service but the other 2 were pretty horrific as the servers just sort of hang out at the bar and don't come check in very often.\n\nIf you want a bloody mary and some good breakfast, it's a good spot, but I am not a big fan of the happyhour/dining/bar side of it.
5	We walked in and were completely impressed by the ambiance and the overall look of the entire place.  We stared with the shrimp cocktail - which had Fresh gulf shrimp, chunky avocados & pico de gallo in a spicy cocktail sauce.  I can say, this was the best shrimp cocktail I have ever had.  We also split a ceasar salad which was perfect.  For dinner, I had the Mahi blackened over dirty rice .  The fish was fresh and spicy - all their fish is flown in daily.  My date had the Pasta Mardi Gra - Linguine tossed with crawfish, andouille sausage & crimini mushrooms in a marinara cream sauce topped with jumbo grilled shrimp. . .  This dish was quite spectacular... We thought we were in New Orleans...  For desert, we had NY Cheesecake - with fresh strawberries in a sauce - topped with fresh whipped cream - I can't think of any cheese cake I have ever had that was better than this...  The desert plate they bring to the table has all the deserts on there - they all looked amazing- quite a difficult choice... WOW - the entire dinner was perfect!  AND on top of it all, our service was top notch.  SAM was excellent - he talked with us and explained the items we had questions on, cleaned the table in between courses, and gave us fresh silver ware - along with always keeping our drinks full.  And he had a great attitude - he acted like he wanted to make our dinner very special.  The manager came and talked with us also, and thanked us for coming in.  Quite impressive.  This was one of the most memorable dinners we have had, from the time we walked in the door until we walked out.  We were completely impressed with Pappadeaux - and can't wait until we return.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would, it is worth it.
5	Udupi is one of the best Indian restaurants that I've ever been to (and I've been to a lot). The Gobi Manchurian (noted by several prior reviewers) and the Chole Peshwari are to die for. I also recommend their Sunday brunch even though it costs more than ordering off their menu. The only downside to Udupi is that it received some bad press for the cleanliness of their kitchen and dining room. I must admit that I saw a cockroach once at Udupi-- but, this was a year ago and they seem to have cleaned up their act. Nonetheless, the food is amazing, well priced, and offers a welcome treat to a veggie-lover's tummy!
5	Shawna is a god-send! She has helped me curb the barking in my house and reinforce obedience training that was lacking. I have also attended Rally Obedience classes with both dogs, they had just as much fun as I did! It's amazing to see her interacting with the dogs and seeing them do exactly what she asks of them. If you've tried other training classes without the desired results, give Maverick a try, Shawna will teach you how to get the response you want from your dogs!
2	"""This location has a much bigger seating area than other locations, which is a big plus in the morning.\n\nHowever, their quality control is severely lacking. I love the smokehouse sausage breakfast sandwich but the last one I got  was from here and it was terrible. The sausages tasted uncooked, the egg was about twice the size of the english muffin, and the english muffin itself had been cooked way too long (not burned, but hard).\n\nAnother small plus, since theyre bigger, they tend to have more than one box of each flavor of KCup packs available. But if you purchase one, you have to deal w/ their register guy who is really not the brightest bulb in the box. Thats mean, I know, but its unfortunately true. Ive had the same guy 4 times and ive experienced slow service, having my order voided 2-3 times because wrong buttons were pushed, a reply of \Huh?\"""" to every order Ive made....super frustrating."""""""
4	"""I am smiling as I walk in and walk out , so you know this has got to be a good place.   The vibe as my oldest and I walk in is \good morning \"""", lots of happy Barristas  serving up  big globs of happy. We were hungry and not quite awake but quickly after eyeing the menu and the sunshine vibe , we got our happy on and we too were ready for the day. Love the bright retro  mood as you walk in complete with Upbeat old school music \n( Abba, Issac Hayes and the theme from Happy Days, I am not joking ) \nI had a tall cooling caffeine laden glass of pomegranate, green tea that made me smile, along with a nice made to order pile of eggs and fruit . The taste was filling and just what I wanted ..that's I went with the made to order eggs.    Jessica had the egg burrito that looked so big I was afraid for her. It was tasty and actually way too much food.  Mmmmmmyummmy.    \nClean , Neat well organized, and a little health food mini mart to boot. Wish  I lived close enough to make this place my go to local market...\nI will be back with Mom in tow ..and next time I am getting a wicked pastry ....thanks Luci."""""""
5	Our company held our fourth annual user conference here, and compared to our previous venues, this one was a smash hit in terms of facilities.  It compares particularly favorably with the doudy, sour old St. Francis in San Francisco, a venue I hope we never book again.\n\nThe standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service.  Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes, including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done.  The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable, attentive, extra-mile oriented staff.  They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy.\n\nThe event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days.  Where at the St. Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy, uncooperative, disinterested staff, here at the Fairmont, the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event.
4	So much food to pick from...When I want to pack on the pounds and feast on good ole meat and potato's this is on top of my list.  When I go out with the guys its almost a competition of who can eat the most plates.  \nThe rolls are excellent, the selection is great, yes you can pound down fresh salad and fruit if you are on a diet.  Or go all out and eat sweet potato mash with marshmallows and turkey and gravy....Thanksgiving everyday :)\n\nGreat tip: Arrive before 11, I would go at 1030 eat some bacon and eggs and then after 11 they serve lunch items.  Great breakfast items also.....Enjoy :)
5	"""DROOL. \n\nEvery time I want Middle Eastern food (and I am today but Seattle sucks for such thing thus far)....I think of Haji Baba. Introduced to me as one of the first restaurants I ate at when I was a freshman at ASU (wow that was 6 years ago-- I'm old). \n\nWhat I miss most is the chicken shawarma plate that I would order with salad instead of tabooli and hummus (no offense to tabooli-- it's great here but I'm not a fan). Their hummus is good because it is made with the right ingredients and it's simple. Hummus should be kept simple.  The shawarma garlic sauce with the sririacha-- is a true delight.  \n\nWhat else is good: EVERYTHING! Falafel, gyro, shawarama salad, all their appetizers. Their lemonade is homemade and not too sweet. It has a weird flavor that gives it a \ what is this?\"""" appeal. Also in AZ when it's hot, drinks = must because the water sucks. \n\nDon't  forget to get a baklava. They have like 6 or 7 diff varieties and they are all delicious. You can also check out their small market which is a part of the restaurant and has a wide variety of middle eastern random goods and spices. \n\nBig portions (I always had lots of leftovers), cheap food and a simple approach. I MISS YOU HAJI BABA and I promise I will go back to you every time I visit."""""""
5	We went to the Grand Opening of the WINCO up on Bell Rd and 7th Ave and it was a madhouse. But the prices were better than other grocery stores overall. We have been back a few times afterwards and the huge crowds have gone down. Prices on fresh produce are great! Just picked up pineapple for 98 cents each! \n\nI like the fact that they don't allow credit cards. It keeps the prices down for the consumer :-) \n\nWe have been bringing our own bags for use and I like the feature of the cashier lines to allow you to easily bag your own groceries. I like the earth friendliness of the store.\n\nIt's open 24/7. \n\nIt's probably one of the reasons the Safeway on 19th ave and Union Hills is closing.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful. I haven't had any issues with questions I have asked of them.\n\nOverall - a pleasurable place to shop :-)
2	I went to BF a while back & thought the food was just OK. The way my friend & I were treated when we showed up a few minutes before our reservation was a true slap in the face. They were completely rude & told us to wait in the hallway near the bathrooms until our table was ready. What was interesting is that there were only a few patrons in the restaurant. I'm a huge foodie and recommend many establishments to my clients and this one is definately off the list.  I don't care how good your food is but if the service is bad, I will never return.  There are too many great restraunts in the Phoenix area with great service and great food to waste my hard earned money at a place like Bread Fruit.
4	I love the cornbread!  I love how it has nice whole kernels and that it comes to your table warm.  My husband ordered the special, which was the duck tacos.  OMG!  I hope it stays on the menu permanently.  They were sweet yet spicy.  I love that.  The dish wasn't too big or too small.\nI ordered the Chicken Jerk Salad.  I order this every time I come here.  I ask for the dressing on the side and asked for Caesar dressing instead of sesame ginger dressing.  I love it.  I can never finish it though, so my husband has no problem helping me.  \nService was great!  Hopefully I can make it to happy hour one day.
4	I've been here twice and both times enjoyed my food and service.  It seems the people most disappointed were the ones who saw the place on TV or had a coupon.  Maybe that's why I liked it so much.  Neither one of those applied to me so I wasn't expecting to be served golden eggs on a silver platter for half price.  I just expected a good breakfast and they delivered with great service both times.  \nI've had an omelet and the jalapeno cheddar biscuits and gravy.  Both very yummy.  The biscuits and gravy is a very large serving and I prefer mine with eggs.  It was waaaaaay too much food.  Both times I had the iced coffee and I thought it was great iced coffee.  To those comments about just asking for coffee and putting ice in it.... wouldn't that make an iced coffee?  If you want an iced latte or frappucino, you should go to Starbucks.  If you want an iced coffee, rather than hot, with your delicious breakfast, order the iced coffee at Over Easy. \nI can't wait to try so many other things on the menu.  Like chicken and waffles, waffle dogs, brioche stack, or the chilaquiles.  I'm pretty certain I won't be disappointed by any of them.
5	Holy crap this is some good BBQ.  \n\nMy wife and I love BBQ and are always looking to try new places.  When we saw this place was just down the street from us we decided to give it a try.  My wife and I both got the smokin' meal, which comes with brisket, pulled pork, sausage and two sides.  The meats were each equally fantastic and the BBQ sauce was really, really good.  I also really enjoyed the baked beans and cornbread I got with my meal.  \n\nThe price was pretty reasonable and we got our food super quick.  The place is located in kind of a weird place but it's worth looking for if you have to.  Seriously, some of the best BBQ in town.
2	Returned to Tao Garden for the first time in a while. I was so bummed.\n\nThis used to be our go to Chinese dinner spot. As I mentioned my dad is from Canton, China & good Chinese food is an important thing in our world.\n\nWas just underwhelmed on so many levels. We had a series of dishes (Chinese fried chicken, roast duck, salt & pepper pork, tofu/bak choy dish, greens, veggie chow fun, beef chow fun, seafood soup). \n\nDidn't think anything was stellar and so many of the dishes paled in comparison to previous experiences.  I'm a big fan of chow fun. Just didn't really make an impression. We've also had great fried chicken & roast duck here in the past but they weren't executed well. \n\nCould just be a bad night but didn't feel like it. Not sure that we will be racing back soon. : (
4	"""Wow I guess checking in here 2 times makes me a regular umm ok. well I came here once on a Sunday evening the place wasnt super busy.

My salad was pretty decent. the waiter reccomended the fez salad but of coarse i didnt pick it. stupid, overall left full the small salads are huge!! not sure what the larges look like. \n\nSecond visit we went for Sunday Brunch can't beah three dollar bloody marys.

5	"""I have been to this store several times over the last few years, Sami and his guys are the best!  I expected all Sprint Stores to give the same sort of customer service that the guys at Queen Creek & Alma give.  Boy, was I mistaken.

I was \educated\"""" on the difference between the 2 stores by 3 employees at the corporate store.  They \""""corporate store\"""" should be embarassed at the lack of customer service.

5	I have been eating at this Nello's location for the last 15 years. The pizzas here are awesome and always piping hot. The owner Brian is friendly and willing to make your experience better if it is lacking which it never is at this Nello's. They make the salads fresh to order and the house dressing is SO good! it is even good to dip the crust of your pizza in! I have had every pizza on the menu. I have had the pizza in thin crust and deep dish. Either way you prefer the crust is tasty. I like too that they offer a wheat crust for those of us that are trying to avoid the bleached flour. NELLO'S YOU ROCK! Keep up the good work Brian!
2	"""After reading reviews that \this is the best chinese food in the valley!\"""" my boyfriend and I decided to get some takeout tonight from them.  Their website doesn't have a menu, so I sent the boy away with orders to get me a garlic chicken dish.\n\nI want to give this a single star, however my bf claims his food was better than mine so I'll up it to a two.  Mine was plain terrible.  I have had far better, and in fact had to add some black bean sauce from my fridge to add some flavor to it.  Literally no flavor OR spice in fact.  Ben got chicken fried rice, and the pan fried shrimp.  He said the fried rice was terrible, shrimp was average.  Steamed rice was kinda crunchy, just your average quick cook rice.\n\nNow we are used to east coast takeout, so maybe we've been spoiled but I certainly won't be eating here again.  Bummer because I was really hoping to find a kick ass chinese take-out place close to home.  The search goes on..."""""""
5	Crimpers Salon is definitely the best salon in the valley!!! I have been going to various salons over the years trying to find one I LOVE, then I received a coupon in the mail for Crimpers and decided to try it out.  When I left Crimpers, this was the first time I had ever walked out of a salon not completely hating my hair!  My experience at Crimpers was so nice, the Salon is very clean and the staff is incredibly friendly.  I would request Frank-- he was very nice and did a fabulous job with my hair. (the owner of the salon)   I am planning to go back to the salon again this week to get my hair done again.  I highly, highly recommend Crimpers!
4	This is a cute lil Italian market on N Scottsdale Rd.  It's a lil hidden but has easy parking.  If you go there, you can pick-up some pre-made lunch and desserts from the deli section or store up on imported groceries for your house.  \n\nThere aren't many tables for eating so if you're going to have lunch and eat there, I'd suggest going a lil before or after normal lunch rush hours.\n\nI'm a fan of their lemon bar.  It's very tart and lemony!!\n\nMight see ya there!
4	fun, relaxing little tavern.  The menu is limited but interesting.  Had the cheese plate that was really nice - 3 different cheeses, locally made bread and crackers, dried cherries, dates, apple, some kind of nuts, and honey -  and the big fat pretzel.  Definitely want to try other items next time, particularly the chips & dip, grilled cheese, and tomato soup.  It seemed like they had some interesting beers too!\n\nOur server was extremely attentive, happy to help with the menu, and seemed to know the featured wines.  It was very quaint with tables lit by candles - a wonderful place for drinks and conversation.
2	"""...the Saturday Market is awesome - except for the baked goods from Vincent's.  A $2.50 Almond Croissant that was 1/2 the size of my palm, lacking in flavor, and ice cold?  No.  Sorry.  No.  As a matter of fact, it was the worst almond croissant I have ever eaten.\n\nThe bread pudding was slightly better and the duck and pork tamales are actually quite good.  The overall \Saturday Market\"""" is a nice place, but the products from Vincent's Market Bistro only make me wish I'd have just gone to Tammie Coe, La Grande Orange, or so many others instead."""""""
5	Harkins Theaters are the best mega plexes in the West bar none.  I haven't seen movies on the east coast but when compared to NV, NM, CA, UT, OR, and WA, there is no comparison.  \n\nFirst, their theaters are always clean and fresh looking.  Tickets are reasonably priced.  There are always plenty of movies times.  And my favorite, the concession deals.  Buy the souvenir cup and T-shirt for savings year round.  This is seriously the best deal in any entertainment venue.  Free medium popcorn and a drink refill for $1.  I always upgrade my popcorn for $1.50 to a X-Large.  No other place in the country can touch this value.  \n\nThis particular location has the Cine Capri which is a replica of the old original in Phoenix.  I grew up watching blockbusters there and go here every time I'm back in the Metro Area for a great flick and some nostalgia.  Hit up Harkins anytime and if you're not enjoying your experience, customer service is top notch and will resolve any issues.  Great job Dan Harkins!  Bring some theaters to Las Vegas!
2	Probably the worst Spring Training site in the Valley.  Time has not treated this place well and it really begins to fail as you compare it to the competition.  It is too bad considering the great location.\n\nGetting to Phoenix Muni is pretty simple.  You can take the 202 and get off at Van Buren or you could probably take the light rail if you didn't mind a bit of a walk.  There is a ton of parking around Muni and it is hard to find any that is free.  It does exist, however, along the North-East side of the stadium in the dirt areas.  If you park in the lots, be prepared to walk a mile over the hideous pedestrian bridge.\n\nOnce you get into the stadium, you are bombarded with concrete.  There is literally concrete everywhere you look in this stadium.  The only things not made of concrete are the field and the wooden signs that make up the outfield wall.  All of this concrete, combined with the numerous metal seats, make this one of the hottest ballparks in the Cactus League.  \n\nAccess to the players is not that great either.  While you can catch most of them coming in from right field, their practice field is difficult to get to and secluded.  Pitchers do warm up down the lines which gives you a seat just a few feet from a fastball.  \n\nIn all, Muni is a failure.  The City of Phoenix must improve the area greatly for it to continue to host Spring Training.  It would be nice to see them convert the parking lot into a multi-story entertainment development but, right now, the Zoo is the only other thing over there.  There are no grass seats which is really part of the fun of spring training.  There is little shade.  There are few reasons to go to the stadium and that is unfortunate because the A's are such a good team to watch.
3	In the past year, sadly, my husband and I have witnessed the closing of a few different BWW locations. Our favorite was just across the street from Fiesta mall and conveniently on my route home. I used to come to this location years ago when it first opened. \n\nMy hub and I are big BWW fans, so I took him to this one and he liked it. It's only a few minutes from our house. We're big chicken enthusiasts, so we hit it up once a month. When my in-laws come into town, we go with them. My 2yr old LOVES their mini corn-dogs and french fries. She likes to watch all the tvs too. \n\nLet's talk service: Back when they first opened, service was spectacular. Barely any waiting, quick on the refills, and very friendly. Years later, the friendliness is still there, but that's about it. Sometimes we wait up to half an hour waiting for our wings. That's just too long for wings. Seriously! Also, wouldn't you think in a place that serves spicy wings, the refills would be continuous. Not so much. There have been a few times where I've stopped eating because I refuse to continue without my beverage to cool off with in between wings. \n\nSo-so service, loud restaurant, but REALLY good wings. We'll be back soon, always hoping for better service. :)
4	Sadly, but this location of Oakville Grocery has recently closed. \n\nI've been coming to this Oakville Grocery since they first opened when there was little else opened in the Quarter, and now they are closed.  There selections were great as was their food items behind the deli counter.   It was one of my weekly rituals to come here and shop for something for dinner.  \n\nHey, I would have made the trip just to purchase their pretzels!  I guess I'll need to make the trip to downtown Phoenix to shop at that location.  Sounds crazy, but I did enjoy Oakville.
1	I had been wanting to go to this restaurant since I moved to AZ. I love the FOX restaurants so my boyfriend made reservations for valentine's day. I had my hopes up but I wasn't really impressed.  We were squeezed into a corner table, the service was decent, and it was quite noisy . I didn't feel that I was able to experience the vibe of the restaurant being in the corner. I order pasta w/breadcrumbs/mushrooms, and I ended up returning it. It just didn't taste right. Desert menu was a disappointment as well. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the restaurant.
5	"""I visited The Grind on a Thursday a little before noon. We had no problem getting a table right away. The service was great, we were in and out on our own timeline, not theirs. \n\nI ordered the \Grilled portobello sandwich / fried zucchini, ricotta salata, wild arugula / $10\"""" and \""""Half and half fries / $5\"""" (half sweet potato/hald herbed fries), and water. I was disappointed that fries do not come with the burgers, but I know that their product is supposed to be supreme, so it comes at an extra cost.\n\nThe burger was amazing! I have never had a better mushroom burger-it was somehow juicy! I would order it again in a heartbeat. The fries were good, the sweet potato fries were my favorite.\n\nThe servers were really nice and checked on us several times. \n\nI will definitely return here in the future!"""""""
4	Read about it and saw a number of good reviews so I thought I'd  gave it a try. Clean, fast and efficient.  Service fast but gruff..so know what you want before you order....they like to move things along.  Good quality of the food and good value....nice menu, big selection.  Had Chicago hot dog and fries...dog excellent, fries OK, not great.  Greek salad; very good.  Will go back to try 3 or 4 other items.  Wife (picky) really liked it, too. Lots of things that woman like; humus, salads etc.
1	"""I'm so disappointed in the decline of this restaurant. I once loved the food here. But my last experience was so bad that I haven't been back. We came for lunch and the place was nearly empty (that should have alerted me. Normally it was at least half full a few minutes after opening.) We ordered. I'd brought a friend who loved Indian food and hadn't discovered this place. She was very excited about coming and the free Chai. After ordering we walked over to the Chai station and drew  two cups. Ugh. It was watery, milky and bitter. It tasted old and not at all up to their normal standard. I mentioned the poor quality to the server, who was really trying to be helpful. I even went over and got her a cup and she couldn't drink it. She went to the back and come out and said, \The cook's don't want to make a fresh batch.\""""  Whaaa?  So we dumped the chai and waited for our food. I ordered  the Chicken Tandoori with garlic Naan and my friend had the Chicken Tikka Salad and we waited. And waited. And waited. You could hear arguing for the kitchen. Not a good sign. The server avoided us. After 45 minutes I called her over.  She said the food for coming.  I drank a lot of water while waiting so off to the bathroom and on my way I pass a staff member leaning over a counter eating his lunch. They just opened!? They had customers!? When the food finally arrived it is...meh...not the quality I was accustomed to and not the place I'd bring anyone else for sure. This visit was on March 15, 2012. I haven't been back since to a place that was once a regular once a month stop.  Oh yeah. And my friend hasn't been back either.  I honestly think it has a big management problem."""""""
5	Il Mio Dio.\n\nAccording to Babelfish, that's Italian for Oh My God.\n\nAccording to me, this is the Best Italian. I've had. In the US. Heck, even better than some Italian I've had in Italy. Do you really need me to carry on, especially considering all the reviews listed here? Pizza A Metro has to be doing something right.\n\nThat something would include incorporating fresh ingredients (and dough tossed in front of you after you order a pizza or calzone), tasty arrangements (the calzone was magnificient), and very decent prices (lunch for two w/tip was under $30) into a tiny but efficient establishment. \n\nThe only drawback is that my ass probably couldn't expand enough to accommodate the amount of food I want to eat from here. But Mio Dio, I will put it to the test.
4	This review is long overdue.\n\nI like it, I'm not in love with it, and I certainly do not think any meal is worth waiting for hours, here or elsewhere.  When I have been it was always with a reservation (they will take them for parties of 6-10). Even with the reservation we wait 20-30 mins (sigh.).....\n\nAnyway the pizza is pretty great. My favorite is the Rosa. Pistachios on pizza? Yes please. 5 stars for that. 4 stars for the Margherita and 3 for the Biancoverde. I cannot attest to the meaty varieties, sorry. Love the crust here too, this is good, simple pizza.
2	I have no idea why people are raving about this place. It is extremely over-priced for what you get out of it. There are so many better restaurants in this area that are less expensive.\n\nLet's start from the beginning, shall we? The croissants. People rave about their croissants. Yes they were tasty, no they were not amazing. Go buy Pilsbury croissants in those tubes at the grocery store and throw them in the oven, it'll taste the same.\n\nNext for our meal, I ordered the rack of lamb which I asked for medium rare. When it came out, I didn't even see a hint of pink. I didn't want to send it back because how can you uncook meat?? Do I want to take the chance of someone spitting in my food? I think not. So I figured oh well, maybe it's medium and I'll just eat it as is. I take my knife and cut into the meat, and I'm literally sawing the meat because it's so tough. The sauce was good, but I eat a lot of rack of lamb and I'd say this one fell way below average.\n\nMy date on the other hand asked for the chef to create something special. We were both surprised when the dish came out and it was just simple garden salad with a filet of steak. That was it. That was the chef's SPECIAL creation. \n\nI'm giving this place 2 stars because the atmosphere is romantic, service was great, and the wine was delish. Sure there are dirty restaurants that I would give 1 or 2 stars to, so is it fair? I don't know. I think 2-stars are just about right since I would never go back to Vincent's.
5	I love this place and take all my out of town visitors here for a taste of the Southwest.  The only downside to it being a small place is that it can get very busy and can mean a long wait if you don't reserve a table.  I love that the bar seats are right in front of the open kitchen so you can watch the chefs do their thing with all of those enchiladas and carne dishes.  Their smoked turkey enchiladas are good but if you like spice, go for the rellenos.  Those are some hot roasted green chiles and I love the beef filling and the duck option.  Goes great with a glass of Stella on draught.  Very dark swanky chocolate brown interior with a fireplace and wine bottle walls.
3	Bottom line here.... you get what you pay for. \n\nThe best thing about this place is the location. You're steps away from the light rail, super close to good food, and a few blocks from freeways. \n\nThe breakfast isn't wonderful- but pretty basic. You have choices between 2 cereals, a couple mini muffins, and white bread. Free breakfast is in the restaurant, so if you want to order something more substantial, you can order from the kitchen. I think a 2 egg breakfast was $4.99. But Denny's is so close, you might as well walk there, or take the light rail down to Matt's Big Breakfast in down town.\n\nThe bed was reasonably comfortable and our room was clean. The hot water takes a while, so let it run while you're brushing your teeth so that you can take a nice hot shower. \n\nService was very friendly and welcoming. I wouldn't mind staying here again.
5	I purchased a buywithme.com coupon to get my first ever shellac polish.  Glenda (the technician) is located in the Salon Boutique in suite #32.  When you walk in, you think your inside a mini mall, as each suite is set up as an individual work station for hair stylists, nail technicians, etc.  \n\nUpon meeting Glenda, I was offered a glass of complimentary wine, which was delightful.  (She sure knows the way to my heart)  I opted for the black shellac polish as Halloween is nearing, and my nails look so happy!  They are literally smiling at me!  She took her time doing my nails and made sure they were perfect!  \n\nI would highly recommend coming here because she delivers quality service at a great price.  (623) 329-9443.
5	"""First heard about about St. Francis on local TV show \Arizona PBS ei8ht\""""\nhttp://www.desertsmokebbq.com/blog/tag/st-francis-restaurant/\nand wanted to try it for a new date.  \n\nParking is tight, forget the local street possibilities or the strip mall across the street and resign yourself to their valet.  Ms. D was late in arriving but we still got into their Happy Hour -(thank you Yelp'ers, this was a great tip).  I was early and at my asking The Hostess had saved us the one available outdoor seat which I knew she would want, so they accomodate special requests with ease.  We were cheerfully greeted by server Lonnie who was on top of it and got us exactly what we wanted in two flights of food and twin drink orders for a fantastic value in record time before the happy hour clock struck end.  \n\nI had been before and sought out their Grapefruit 'tinis but they weren't available, so Lonnie recommended the Ruby Reds which we selected and found to be quite good too.  The interior has a wonderful atmosphere, not too loud, pleasantly decorated and be sure to notice the architecture cable ceiled which add a modern tone to the place.  The goat cheese was wonderful, pork verde delicious and Ms. D said her onion burger was fantastic.  Total was just under $45, added 20% tip so it hit the value mark well in the bullseye.\n\nWe were never pushed, politely attended too and had the perfect scenario to focus on our conversation. Wonderful for a first date, casual business meeting or possibly even an anniversary.  I don't hand out Five Stars easily but when I want to impress picky foodie Ms. D and then it all goes well, I pull out the props.  Service, food quality, variety, selection, portions, drinks, and value were all spot on.  This is not the first time I've been to St. Francis and it has been consistent so I'm calling out the rare 5 star award based on dependability and repeated service.  \nThank you"""""""
4	Another Yelp gem... Sonora Mesquite Grill is a place you'd easily drive right by dozens of times and never notice. Inside, it's a cute, clean little restaurant. The guy working there was super friendly and helpful. \n\nWe shared the guacamole, very good. It wasn't the think and creamy type, but the flavor was great! \n\nI ordered the platter, which came with two barbacoa tacos, rice, and beans. The rice was delicious and perfectly seasoned. The beans were excellent, some of the best I've had in a while. The barbacoa was pure smoky deliciousness. The tacos were topped with cilantro and red onions. I cleaned my plate. \n\nMy boyfriend got the carne asada burrito. It was a perfect size, generous, but not so big it was difficult to manage. The beef, tortilla, and other fillings were all very good. \n\nMy horchata was a little too strong for me (I guess I like it to be more watery), but was still nice to have to drink after some spicy salsa. \n\nDefinitely would recommend this place if you're looking for tasty, authentic Mexican food.
1	I am Turkish and Med Fresh Grill does not do a good job to represent Turkish food. Their doner (gyro) is not good at all. Their Adana kebap was ok when they started their business but now it is disaster to eat. It was only choice to eat some Turkish food in Valley. Luckily, now, there is a new Turkish restaurant (called as Turkish kitchen on Warner Ave -between Arizona and Alma School Rd in Chandler) opened last week. If you try their food, you can definitely understand how Turkish food should taste. I hope with this  new Turkish restaurant, Med Fresh Grill can reconsider their menu again to find the true essence of Turkish food.
1	"""My son's request for his birthday was \Old McDonald's\""""  so since my wife refuses I sucked it up and came here Saturday.  I am not a fan of McDonald's or a fan of what it represents, I have respect for Ray Krock but that is about it and I am not sure he would be proud of what he serves today either.  I hope the franchisee doesn't hate me for this review but since McDonald's targets kids with its toys (I know I used to love to go to this place too as a kid) then it gives me no choice but to speak the truth because I am a loyal Yelper that has kids.  My children of course ordered chicken nugget happy meals so they can get the stupid toy.  I made them get the apples and apple juice.  I had not been here in so many years that I noticed an Angus burger that was now on the menu and looked good in the picture.  Of course it was dry and bland, the fries here are always good but I have since learned that they are not exactly 100% potato so there you go.  I pretty much felt like crap when I left but I wanted to not keep my kids always wondering about this place with the desire to go inside.  Next time if he makes the request I will buy a slice of pizza from Barro's across the way and just eat that while my kids eat here.  Sorry McD's your food doesn't do it for me."""""""
5	Alright seriously if you rate AJ's less than 5 than you're a buffoon.  Seriously think about this for a minute.  AJ's offers top quality products and specialty items that you can't find at your typical supermarket.  IE. Langoustines.  Is the store pricey? Yes, but you're paying for top quality products so I don't mind.  Their cheese selections blows any main competitor away as well as their prepared food.  I could go on forever breaking down each department, but I will not bore you.  Shell out the few extra dollars and shop here, you won't be disappointed!
3	Due to the extreme cold INSIDE the building I dropped a star from my previous visit :( I understand having to keep the place cool but I'm pretty sure that I had signs of frostbite, lol. \n\nOnce again, my seat was great, the show was wonderful. \nThe bathroom situation is unlike any other. Seriously, don't drink a whole lot before arriving here. If you do you have to use the lavatory I would suggest making sure that you don't wait until you can't wait any longer due to the fact that you will be faced with VERY long, long lines.
1	"""Very disappointing.  I was looking forward to a lox breakfast, but I don't eat farmed salmon.  So of course I had to ask if the lox was from farmed or wild salmon.  The server checked with the kitchen and it is farmed!  No lox for me.  I then asked about the chicken livers; \are they organic?\""""  I thought the waitress was going to burst out laughing but she quickly composed herself and just lightly shook her head.  Okay, I'm a fuss bucket, I just can't eat nitrates, hormones, preservatives, etc.  I ordered a bagel and wished I had just gone to TJ and picked up some wild Alaskan lox, organic eggs, organic bread, organic butter and I would have gotten it all for the price of their lox & eggs breakfast plate with plenty of quality food stuffs for 4 other meals.  I think this place is past it's due date, old school, no growth and just getting by on low grade food stock and laughing all the way to the bank."""""""
3	I've been meaning to write my review about this place for about 2 months, better late than never I guess... \n\nA friend of mine posted picture on FB, and I was super excited that a Cambodian restaurant had opened in Phoenix!!! I wanted to go ASAP! \n\nThe first time I wanted to go, I called and was informed they were closing at 9, no biggie....2nd time I went by on a Monday afternoon and they were closed.... We were on our way to the Thai place on central when I decided to try this place instead...3rd time was the charm... \n\nSO, if you blink while driving you will miss it!! Make sure you know where you are going or you will be stuck in u-turn hell in the middle of the day. \n\nWhen we arrived we almost ended up in the kitchen! If you had ever been to Fellini's that used to be the main entrance. Anyhow, we we directed to the dining area by the lady in the kitchen. \n\nWhen we walked in, there was no one there to greet us or direct us, we sort of just stood there looking around, it was kind of an uncomfortable feeling b/c all of the Asian diners looked at us like we walked into the wrong part of town....anyhow a young girl finally came out of a door and let us to a table, she asked if we would like some water, we said yes, we saw the menu and asked for the french pressed coffee as well. Off she went to get our drinks....or so we thought.... \n\nWe FINALLY got our drinks about 15-20 Mins later. The coffee was amazingly great, it looks like you will get 2 sips and be over, but once you pour it over the ice it loosens up and fills the cup.. \n\nI had the chicken and rice lunch special, it was actually alot more flavorful than it appears. My gf had a noodle dish with beef and a spring roll. \n\nThe spring roll (the fried version)  that comes with the lunch special made its way out to me about 20 mins after my meal...it was definitely the worst part of the meal....the filling had a questionable taste and odor....definitely seemed spoiled to me. when I told the waitress I would not be eating it because the filling had turned, the owner (?) came out and apologized, he said he would taste it. He came back about 5 minutes later and told me that's how they were supposed to taste. He said I was probably not used to the flavors...and they used dried mushrooms in the mix... he even said that its not like a Thai spring roll, but more like a Vietnamese springroll...I explained to him that I was in the food service industry and I had had Cambodian food, and Vietnamese food in NYC a million times, and this spring roll had gone bad...anyhow, he comped the $1 item and off we went. \n\nI am undecided if I will go back, the coffee is worth it, the service is definitely not.\n\n\nI also felt slightly offended by the guy's opinion of me not knowing the difference between a spoiled spring roll and a spring roll with fresh filling....\n\nThe prices are good\nThe food is flavorful\nThe service is not great, not the worse service in the valley (think mrs. whites golden rule)\n\n\nI'm sure with time the place will get better.
5	Omg laulau. That really could be this whole post. It is one of the few things I miss from living in Hawaii. They only have it on saturdays, and call ahead to make sure they haven't run out. I had the platter, and ate the whole thing, which is not a good idea, because you will explode from being so full.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty low key, and I absolutely LOVE that this is a real hawaiian place, not some asian fusion, we put a pineapple in it so its hawaiian wannabe place. \n\nOn top of the absolutely awesome laulau, they have hawaiian specialty take home stuff, I got a frozen bit of kulolo which I can't wait to steam and enjoy. They also have poi, but I've never gotten into the stuff. \n\nOh, and canned guava juice like I used to get in hawaii too, like biting into a real guava.\n\nI was in hawaiian heaven, a pleasant reminiscence of when I lived there.
4	The Lather boutique in Kierland Commons is a place where nature meets nurture. As soon as you set foot in this store, you're hit with a calm simplicity that manifests in their skin and body products, packaging and atmosphere. On the many occasions that I've dropped by this store, the sales people have always been welcoming albeit a bit too enthusiastic on occasion to help. But they back off and let you quietly trip through the store, sniffing here and sampling there. At the back of the store is a sink where you can sample their scrubs and soaps. Their body care kits and candles make great gifts and as far as must-have items, Lather's yuzu and bamboo body washes, scrubs and lotions are classic hits. If you have sensitive skin, their skincare lines are gentle and nature-based. You usually will get a few samples with purchase (if you don't, just ask!). The store is tucked at the far end of the shopping center near Tommy Bahama's and Anne Taylor Loft. Let your nose point you in the right direction!
4	My husband and I went there during their progressive happy hour (50% off 5-6pm, 40% off 6-7pm, 30% off 7-8pm) where EVERY ITEM on the menu are discounted.  What a great deal!  We loved everything we had- especially the tuna taco- so much that we ordered that item twice!  It was topped with buck wheat soba noodles that has been infused in lemon so it was very zesty- delicious!  We enjoyed our dinner immensely.  The best part?  It was on a Saturday night!
3	I've been wanting to eat here since it opened and had high expectations from the new chicken joint on the block.  I was underwhelmed:\n\nThe strips themselves seem to be of higher quality than other places but the overall flavor just isn't there.  The fries, cole slaw, and toast are all pretty ok and nothing special.  Standard stuff.  The dipping sauce that some people rave about is also just ok.  It tastes almost like thick Italian dressing and marinara sauce mixed with a hint of ranch.  It is ok at best and is just weird with chicken strips.\n\nThe price is a bit high.  I got one of the meal deal things and it was almost 10 bucks.  Not horrible but not a stellar value either.\n\nOn the other hand, the drive through line was pretty fast during the lunch rush and the workers were friendly.  Anyway, the next time I feel like eating a junk-food-heart-attack for lunch I'm going down the street to Churchs.  Just give me some overly fried strips of cheap chicken with some ranch and I'm happy.
2	"""In five bullet points:\n\n*Good service. The waiter was attentive, and delivery was awfully quick. Their decor is also kinda tasteful too.\n*Really bland food. The menu is one of the shallowest I've seen from a real chain restaurant in years. The minestrone in particular had an issue, being spiked with some spice that way overpowered the flavor and made it horrid. The toasted ravioli appetizer was better than their \signature\"""" cheese-butter pasta.\n*In hindsight, should have gone to CPK or somewhere else instead -- if you want real Italian, there are local and better chain places from which to get it -- Olive Garden (of which there is one across Chandler Blvd, north of the mall) and RigaTony's both come to mind. This is a restaurant for large families that need cheap, fast food. (This is probably why their meals are \""""complete\"""" meals.)\n*The previous occupant of the OSF space was a restaurant called Garduno's, featuring Mexican food. They did better at food than OSF. \n*How has this chain not only been in business for 42 years but expanded throughout the West and into select markets east of that? (St. Louis, Indy, Minneapolis, Louisville)"""""""
1	Let's just say that it's a pretty cool place that based on service won't be open long. We stopped in for MNF and had to beg to be served! Then they took the meal order for my girl friend, but didn't take mine. One meal came out and they finally put 2 and 2 together and figured out what happened.\n\nNext, we had to actually reach over the front of the bar to get silverware. Most restaurants automatically give those to you.\n\nNext, the ice in the drinks is so small, you have to use a straw, whether you want to or not. \n\nCan't rate their food becasue they never asked if I wanted to order but the service was awful and I won't be back.
4	I love it here. We eat here all of the time. I usually get a Brisket, cheesy potatoes, and beans- All are very flavorful. On the weekends there is always a line out the door but it moves pretty fast. They have a side window so that you can order food to go. You can also call it in and pick it up at the window for faster service. It still tastes great when you get it home. If you haven't eaten here I would definitely give it a try.
5	I loved this place. I can't believe I hadn't checked it out sooner. The concept is hilarious and the food is really good. I got The Kind (bacon, turkey, swiss, and mushrooms) and it was delicious. The guys that worked there were really warm and friendly and joked with me. They even have Kool-Aid which I think is awesome. The sandwiches don't need mustard or mayo; the oregano and oil and vinegar give it enough flavor. This has easily become my favorite sandwich shop in the Tempe area and I look forward to eating here again as soon as possible.
4	Came here for the lunch combo, which is a lamb gyro with fries and a drink all for like $7 (I can't remember the actual price, but that's about right).  The fries were crispy on the outside, somewhat flaky on the inside, and neither fat nor skinny, right in-between.  The gyro was in a warm pita with a BUNCH of delicious lamb, some tomatoes, and a good helping of their tzatziki.  I love tzatziki, and this was pretty good, but it could have been a bit more cucumbery for my taste. \n\nCheap HUGE delicious meal.  Definitely great for lunch!
2	"""You would think with the economy being what it is today, it would be easy for any establishment to hire semi-intelligent people to run the register. \nI went into sprinkles to taste some of their fall specials and I walked into a scene that was beyond depressing. My first experience with Sprinkles is when I lived in LA. You couldn't get a cupcake without waiting in line at least 30 minutes. Scottsdale, you have 4 perky girls greeting you, with their cupcake themed baby tees the minute you walk through the door. \nThe trays were empty and the selection was bare at best. I ordered 4 cupcakes. NOT rocket science. 1-2-3-4 \nThere was one other woman waiting for a large order, a couple dozen at least. The dingbat ringing us up tried to charge me over $80 for 4 cupcakes!! Whoa! \Are you sure those are mine?\"""" \nHer response was \""""is your name Susan?\"""" No it is not. She gives me a blank look like she saw a ghost. So this is uncomfortable. I kindly nudged her by saying \""""I think my total should be in the $13 range, I only got 4 cupcakes. \"""" \n\""""The tag says you got 4 dozen.\"""" (i can't remember the exact qty) \nNow Red Velvet (remember the themed shirts?) is testing my patience. Is that still Susan's order? \nOh duh! Now we get it! \nAfter all that I get the cupcakes home, and they are dryer than a popcorn fart. Disappointing."""""""
4	"""First impression, this place rocks!! It's in the space that used to house Palette.. the space has a very \breezy\"""" sort of Caribbean plantation feel that's easy to relax right into.. not to mention the moment you walk through the gate you're greeted by friendly smiling faces. \n\nLB has a massive outdoor patio complete with tables, well appointed outdoor sofas and chairs where you can leisurely sip a cocktail or beer. While their grand opening isn't truly until Tuesday (12th of May) they seem to be ironing out their kinks pretty quickly with only a few minor hiccups mostly due to computer errors rather than human. \n\nThe menu is made up mostly of burgers, salads, lahvosh pizzas and a few entrees. We ordered a few starters, the LB Favorite (bacon and roasted corn lahvosh pizza, half $9) as well as the Queen Creek Olive Oil (kalamata, tomato, fresh basil and feta lahvosh, half $9). You know you can put bacon on just about anything and have it taste awesome but paired with the right flavors the good becomes great! The sweetness of the roasted corn with the savory saltiness of the bacon sent me into piggy heaven! Was so good I didn't want to share but alas, I'm a good guy like that. The Queen Creek Olive Oil lahvosh was very tasty, the lahvosh being crispy and light but sturdy enough to hold the ample toppings. I love olives and olive oil paired with cheese and the feta was a great idea. The cheese being strong enough to stand up to the kalamata, the tastes were right on.\n\nMeanwhile we were all sipping on Nimbus Brown Ale ($4) which was ice cold, rich and complex. Nimbus is certainly one of my favorite craft beers and at 4 bucks, nice! LB also has a full bar and while cocktails around 8 bucks they pours are generous. We didn't have wine service but the manager Eric used to be the sommelier at The Grill at TPC back in the day when it was one of the best steak houses in town. He knows his wine so I look forward to next time when I can enjoy a glass or 6. \n\nI ordered the Fire Island ($10) which is one of several classic Pischke dishes on the menu that made it over from the old days. Oh yes, the owner Sid Campbell was a cook at Pischke's Paradise for over 12 years before it was ruined by new owners. The Fire Island is a pizza with chicken breast, red onion, green chilies and a cream cheese sauce that is absolutely finger licking tasty! Be sure to ask them to add 2 over easy eggs on the top, outrageous! \n\nThe Mr ordered the Roasted Green Chile Cheeseburger ($10) which is served on MJ's Breads giant English muffin. The beefy flavor combined with the soft texture of the English muffin was excellent, you can taste the quality and the smokiness of the green chile. An order of house fries comes with the burgers and sandwiches and let me just say, they were seasoned so well that you could have chowed them down plain. However, the bread and butter pickle ketchup is simply amazing with its dice of bread and butter pickles, never knew ketchup could be elevated to another experience! \n\nFirst impressions last nearly forever and this one was great! I think LB has a bright future in front of them. This will be a great place to hang out on the patio after work with friends, drinks and cool conversation. Excellent addition to the neighborhood."""""""
5	"""$22.95 for your deliciousness? SIGN ME UP. Can I get frequent diner points or even a fast pass so I can get seated sooner? \n\nEvery time I go... you do not fail me. Amazing service, stellar food (hey, I'm vegetarian... it's yummy!) and a fun, dynamic atmosphere.\n\nWhen we went the other day, it was Saturday night and we were seated right away which impressed me. \n\nIf able to be seated outside... you should. The people watching alone is priceless. And while I am not one of \those\"""" pretty people, I think that is what I appreciate about here--I can come in my bermuda shorts, flip flops and polo without shame.\n\nOur waiter the other day was hilarious and didn't rush us to complete our meal despite the extensive pile up outside. And while yea, it's a Fox restaurant, I don't care. They offer classy vegetarian (no, I don't eat fish) dishes not found elsewhere. For me, this matters."""""""
1	After moving to Phoenix from Japan in 2007 I was instantly looking for a good Japanese restaurant and after talking to my Japanese next door neighbor we went to Tomo's and were pleasantly surprised how good it was.  BUT, slowly after the past few years it has been a downward spiral until now, and after my last experience a few days ago I will not go back.  I don't know if they are under new management or new cooks but it is nowhere as good as it used to be.  My last experience I ordered my food my phone is picked it up like I've done countless limes before.  I came in and was not greeted, which is odd, then I stood in front of the counter for pick up while everyone just looked at me and walked by. Finally I had to grab someone from the sushi counter to help me. Then I waited for 30 minutes after the 45 I had already waited before arriving after my call in.  By the time I got my food it was cold and wrong, all I wanted to do was leave.  The Tomo special roll, which is normally amazing with its razor thin jalapenos had huge chunks of them just thrown on top.  The BBQ chicken was nothing but a grilled, cold chicken breast, minus the BBQ, they forgot the Miso, and the rice was undercooked.  This experience is not the first from Tomo, just the culmination of a few years of bad service.  I will not go back again, and are currently looking for a new Japanese restaurant to call mine.
5	Mmmm, just thinking about Los Dos makes my mouth water. If you like it hot, hot, hot, this is the place for you!\n\nTrue, it's strangely located in a dumpy Mesa industrial building and true, the food is not for the faint of heart (or faint of taste buds). But, the enchilada-style green chile burros here are among the BEST this native Arizona gal has ever tasted. Try one with a dollop of sour cream to cool the burn!\n\nService can be a little sketchy - the last time I was there, our server was a Mexican with a NY deli attitude, if you can imagine that. But don't let that stop you from experiencing an Arizona original.
4	"""I came in to the Joya Salon and made an appointment for a Polish Change since the manicure I had gotten the day before did not last and my polish was already coming off. \n\nRebbecca (Becky) was my Nail Technician, she was really nice, offered me Ice Tea which was Delicious Hibiscus Raspberry (China Mist). \n\nThe Salon was very nice and relaxing. Once I decided on a color she took care of my nails, did an excellent job and they are still looking pretty after 3 days. \n\nThe spa/salon offers a 15% discount on all services to local residences. \n\nUpon checkout I realized I was charged for a Petite Manicure, no wonder I got a little massage and the whole works. \n\nMy service was excellent, however, when I made the appointment for a polish change I feel I should have been told \we do not offer only polish change, however we do a petite manicure....\"""" \nLike I said I had a manicure the day before I didn't need another one I just wanted my nails painted and that would have been nice to know. \n\nI enjoyed my visit though and can't wait to return to try some other services."""""""
3	"""The looks of the place is pretty cool they have music blaring outside as you walk up. I hate the line set up as if your waiting to check in to a hotel, plane, or waiting for a ride at an amusement park. The staff was totally friendly and attentive until we needed something like another drink or ketchup. \n\nThe desk seating w office chairs might be ok if you're a tall person but for a shorty like me or kids this won't work if you want to actually see a movie! Being a parent here to see The Muppets w the kid I noticed this problem immediately. Its not a good view the desk part comes up too high. We had to opt for the theater seats they are big and roomy but you def lose closeness here. Forget watching scary movies and hiding your face in your boyfriends shoulder. Forget a make out session w your secret lover! No cuddling here either! Heck you'll be lucky if you even get to hold hands through all this! If you are more than a party of 2 say goodbye to everyone else because they will be too far away to even see although they're just 2 seats away! \n\nThey claim you press the button and someone will be with you immediately and before the movie starts I totally agree. I REALLY like how right before the movie started they prompt you to turn \OFF\"""" your phones AND if your child becomes disruptive to step out of the theater! How many movies have you sat through wishing someone would say that??? \n\nI was not shocked at the price of food, it is Scottsdale after all. I ordered the Margharita pizza, the man ordered Cesar w grilled Chicken, and the little had a cheeseburger meal. The beer was cheap I thought so why not some Shiner Bock on tap. Our pints came back w no head idk about you but who doesn't like a little head?!?!?! \n\nThe food didn't take too long and wasn't so quick either which I didn't mind so much it made me tink they were cooking my food at least. The kid devoured her burger and fries so that got her approval but let's be honest kids will eat anything even McDonald's! Am I right??? My pizza came out piping hot and it was good to go in my belly. I would have liked a little more tomatoes and basil and a little less grease just my opinion. Take it or leave it. The salads are GINORMOUS keep this in mind and ask for extra extra dressing so you don't run out and have to sit there looking at your salad for 15 mins waiting for someone to bring you more! Assuming your options for your salad are either fried or grilled chicken you may think you are getting some kind of HOT meat on it. Well it's not the grilled chicken was cold and while there was a lot of it looked like shredded chicken that's prob not so fresh if you catch my drift. \n\nIt is kind of annoying people walking back and forth the whole time and while there is more space between you and other people it still gets distracting. I'll blame my last issue on Mercury being retro, when the check came and they doddled off the pen did not work. I scribbled for 5 mins and gave up. When the movie was over and we got back into light I realized my hands were covered in ink in fact I still have some 2 days later. I wouldn't go here for a good movie that you really need to get into. For family time it's ok I suggest eating at home and ordering some some popcorn, dessert, and drinks!"""""""
3	"""Vietnamese food had never even crossed my mind before, so after someone mentioned Pho Thanh I was interested in trying it. I've been there six times as of now. \n\nThe first time I went to the Pho I didn't have time to eat my meal there so I got take out. I got the number 133, which is a charbroiled slab of beef with steamed rice and veggies (posted a pic of this). Although for me it was more like charbroiled fat and bone; it hardly had any beef at all. My friend ordered the same thing, but he actually got a slab of beef. Maybe I was just unlucky and got the bad part of the \beef\"""". \n\nOn my second trip I got the number 42, which is vermicelli (cold noodles) that come with a pork shrimp sliced egg roll, sliced grilled pork patty, and veggies all in the same big bowl. The pork patty was very good; juicy and tender, the egg roll was good too, and the vermicelli was kind of bland by itself until I mixed it with the veggies which where hidden underneath it, and added a little salt. \n\nOn my third time there I got the number 12 beef noodle soup / pho tai. To me, the broth was just OK but nothing special. Thinking that the broth was just a fluke that day, I got the shrimp pho at a later visit and again I wasn't too crazy for the broth. But I've been to the nearby Da Vang and I loved the pho there. I've ordered it twice and both times it has been great...a little on the salty side, but still better than Pho Thanh's for my personal taste. \n\nI've also ordered the number 123, which is beef and a salad, with either rice or bread. I chose mine with rice; it goes great with the beef. The salad was OK. The beef was very juicy and tender. I put some beef in the rice a little at a time. They bring out the beef cut in small cube bite size pieces on a metal plate still sizzling loud enough to get the attention of the other diners. \n\nAlso, I've ordered pork shrimp egg rolls as an appetizer, and a banh mi sandwich for take out my four times there. The egg rolls are great; they also come with a plate of veggies and fish sauce to dip the rolls in. I've tried all four sandwiches and my favorite is the number 75 grilled pork sandwich; the patty in this sandwich and the patty that comes with the number 42 are just so juicy and tender! (posted pics of the egg rolls and a sandwich, tho it's the cold cut sandwich) \n\nInspired by Da Vang's delicious beef stew / bo kho, I decided to try the beef stew with rice noodles here at Pho Thanh. It was a disappointment. The portion is only half of what Da Vang gives you, and the pieces of beef are not tender and are studded with chunks of fat, and there weren't many noddles to speak of, the opposite of Da Vang's. I ended up leaving all the pieces of beef because they had so much fat on them it was impossible to eat around it. It wasn't very filling In the end it wasn't a very good meal. If you want a generous amount of good beef stew I recommend trying it at Da Vang. \n\nDa Vang may have the better beef stew, but Pho Thanh has the better bahn xeo crepe. At Da Vang it's really greasy, rock hard, burnt, and very little filling. Here at Pho Thanh it's perfect; not much grease, pliable, and a generous amount of bean sprout, shrimp, and pork filling. \n\nHaving been to both Pho Thanh and Da Vang, I personally prefer Da Vang. Like most Vietnamese places, the prices are great; about less than $10 for a meal, and you will get more than enough food. (Unless you order the beef stew at Pho Thanh lol)"""""""
2	The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars is because the beds were very cozy and the food was yummy.  They also kept it clean, but that's kind of a mandatory basic.\n\nThe service is really what brings the rating down.  They gave away my suite even though I pre-checked in and they said it would be ready soon.  Not to mention, I had my reservation in place for a good 5 months in advanced.  It wouldn't have been so bad at that point.  Hey, mistakes happen.  I get it.  However, they did a poor job at rectifying the mistake.\n\nThe front desk had horrible communication problems.  Even the one nice girl who tried to be helpful didn't seem properly trained and kept throwing her co-workers under the bus for the mistake instead of taking responsibility (poor team work, come on people) and just making it right.\n\nIn the end (after WAY too much negotiating on my part) they gave me a different room, which I had to pay over $100 extra per night (which they tried to tell me is the best discount their manager will allow). I said I should at least get free breakfast for this crap and they FINALLY decided they could let me have 1/2 off (gee thanks).  This whole process took at least an hour and a half of talking to them and getting on the phone with their manager etc.  After a day of traveling and a HUGE wad of money that I put down expecting a luxurious care-free vacation, it's kinda the last thing anyone wants to have to deal with, ya know?\n\nI had a great trip in the end but would not stay here again in fear of what could go wrong the next time.  I'm still a fan of marriott in general but here, the manager needs to better train their front desk staff.
4	Definitely like others said, try the breakfast burrito! They are definitely worth it, they are huge and can fill you up. Looks can be deceiving, because they look small on the menu board, and they will look small when you get it. You may order two because you feel hungry, but trust me, you will barely be able to finish HALF of one! They are very fulfilling at all times of day, especially when you're  just looking for something quick and cheap.\n\nThe minute you order, they will immediately begin cooking your order in the back, which means, yes, there will be a little bit of a wait. But the wait is worth it. \n\nOTHER THINGS I RECOMMEND  YOU TRY OUT: \n\nRolled Tacos- DELICIOUS\nNachos\nCarne Asada w/ beans!
1	"""From the beginning the service here was so-so, the boutique is open by appointment only and whenever I attended appointments for my friend who was the bride we ended up waiting for our consultant to arrive. The store in itself is limited in selection and not in the greatest shape. I tried on a few dresses myself which were stained, had broken zippers etc... When one of the sample dresses was too large I had to be \clamped\"""" into it (taking in the excess fabric from the back with a spring loaded clamp). Unfortunately this took with it a chunk of my flesh. I understand mistakes happen, but seriously... Ouch!\n\nMy experience as a guest of the bride was mediocre but my friends experience as the bride in question has been horrific! I've encluded her side of the story.\n\n\""""I picked out my dress in January 2012 and got measured for it in September. I got a phone call a month later that they can't find a manufacturer to make my dress. Ok,disappointing, but I was offered a refund or the opportunity to pick a new dress. When I arrived at the salon again, there was the dress I picked out, still on the rack (and not the rack designated as sample only; the rack of dresses available to be ordered.) I asked about it and got something of a brush off answer, no real explanation. A lot of questions I asked needed to be directed to the owner, who was not answering or returning phone calls. I ended up requesting a refund as offered, but no one seemed to know how to issue one and, again, no response from the owner. I was also told they had no record of how much I needed to be refunded as my receipt was with the unreachable owner. Fortunately I had my copy with me, but still walked away with no refund. It's been a week and still no word from anyone at Iris D. Unacceptable.\"""""""""""
4	In a place where chain restaurants and fast food joints are king, Pita Jungle (only a local chain) beckons - even though it's 7 miles away from the hotel I stay when I'm here for work. I gladly drive (yes, I used 'glad' and 'drive' in direct relation) the 15 minutes to eat here (or carry out). \n\nThe menu is diverse, fresh and healthy, and there are tons of veggie options. I've been twice - last time with a friend who was living here (thanks, Dave!) and this time on my own - and have had the veggie wrap and tonight had the black bean burger. The veggie wrap was HUGE and had the most unique combo of ingredients - brown rice (like a soft burrito, mmm), broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, carrots and I think a saffron seasoning. It was AMAZING. They were out of the black bean burger that first time so I had to try tonight and was NOT disappointed. Came with sliced roasted red peppers, lettuce, tomato and onions and on soft multi-grain bread. Delicious home fries on the side. YUM. \n\nI also recall that their trio of hummus is fantastic. And they have a good selection of bottled beers, including a local organic brew. \n\nAs a side note - their Web site is rad! Very neat design and artwork throughout. Props for that, for sure! \n\nOh - and I almost forgot to mention their dirt cheap prices! This place gets a San Francisco thumbs up, for sure! :)
2	First, I love Teppanyaki restaurants. It is always a fun time introducing new people to those type of restaurants. Benihana was my second choice, but Option A was closed. Being a chain, I knew I had a good shot it would still be in business. I prefer the smaller restaurants - typically more entertainment and lower cost, but Benihana is typically good and it is open.\n\nThere were 3 chefs working yesterday and we got the white guy. He was nice, but he wasn't as good as the ones at the other tables. This isn't him, because the other chefs didn't do it either, but there was no volcano like every other teppanyaki place does and no big flame to clean the grill. Probably being a chain they are more worried about law suits resulting from fire. Instead of volcano with flame, it was a train with smoke. \n\nBenihana is more expensive than other places, but considering it is like dinner and a show, it isn't bad. The show part was not as good as it could be. The chef was okay and for the first timers with me, they thought it was good. The flavor of the food was okay, but not the best I have had. It was just kind of ho-hum for me. Interestingly enough after he was finished with our table, the chef went to another table that was all Asian customers. I wondered to myself what they must think getting the one white guy in the place - then the loud clanking noise of him dropping the cart and the food on the ground told me they probably weren't impressed. \n\nFor 2 people ordered one of the standard combos and water, it was $65 ($80 after tip). A little expensive for the lackluster performance and average quality of the food. I would recommend finding a smaller local establishment. At least they usually throw shrimp at you and douse you with saki if you catch it.
2	The flavors were okay, tasted like any other yogurt shop I've had. \nIt was clean but not as clean as everyone was bragging on here. The thing that I didn't like about the place is the girls that working their weren't really friendly, they act like they didn't like their job. When my boyfriend and I walked in to the shop, the girl was getting her own yogurt. And acted like it was so rude of us to interupt her. None of the girls had uniforms on, nor aprons on so it was hard to tell who was, and wasn't working. Anyhoo, when we cashed out, I just couldn't believe that it was almost 11 dollars. .42 cents per ounce is kind of a lot. When we were about to leave another girl asked me if I was ready to be rang up and I said we already paid for it. And she kept on insicting that we didn't pay for it. So I had to argue with her about it until she asked another employee if we were telling the truth. Its kind of irritating when I had the recipet in my hand too, about to show her.\nI'm definitely not going there ever again.
3	3.5 stars - overall pleased, would adopt as a happy hr. standby, rated downward b/c food was decent, not raveworthy.\n\nQuite pleasantly surprised to discover this airy, spacious resto-lounge in Scottsdale Fashion Sq. Stopped in during happy hr. on a Thursday, decent mix of patrons. Overall space is versatile and occasion-friendly, great alfresco feel as giant oak doors were opened to the outdoor patio.  Lounge is perfect for small parties with low couches and leather sofa chair seating.  Great happy hr. specials (M-F 4-6pm) $5 small plates, well drinks, house wine, sangria. \n\nProsciutto bruschetta w/crescenza cheese, arugula & fig preserves was perfectly balanced. Italian sausage flatbread w/pequillo peppers & goat cheese - the peppers and goat cheese made this flatbread, the sausage was overly crumbled and didn't add much flavor. The cheese plate was fine - a mild blue and a mild Spanish cheese, plated with thinly sliced apples, marinated in a fruit jam.\n\nApparently, they're serving a $20 3-course prix-fixe w/several interesting options through 10/31. Menu here: http://www.foxrc.com/downloads/menus/O&I_Prix_Fixe_Menu.pdf\n\nCons: White (pink) sangria was prettily presented sugar-rimmed, but served sans fruit (odd). Have had much better sangria. Service was spotty but potentially b/c bartender was doubling as our server, other servers ended up busing our table and were helpful.\n\nLook forward to checking out other Fox concepts True Food Kitchen and Zinburger.
1	"""First off, the misters that great you as you buy tickets is a much needed relief on those hot summer days.  The beverages and snacks are expensive as all get out but you already knew that.  Movie theaters treat themselves like airports.  No outside food or beverage.  What a crock.  I still sneak in a can of Mr. Pibb and Red Vines, cause like Andy Samberg said, \They're crazy delicious.\""""  Next we have the bathrooms.  (MEN) Do Not take a dump here!  The floors are sticky and not just by the urinals, but the sinks as well.  Have people been that desperate that they try to hit the sink?  They should clean up more often.  Now we come to the viewing chamber.  Meh.  Stadium seating is here, but that's not really much of a plus is it?  They are everywhere.  It's as if there are still people saying things like, \""""Your minivan has TWO sliding doors?!  No way!  That's like the coolest thing ever!\""""  The floors were sticky.  Maybe the guys going in the sink are tracking it back into the theater...nah probably soda.  Now the screen size.  Small. I previously lived near a theater that had those mega screens.  I guess I've just gotten used to it.  There is a review here that mentions kids in Rated R movies.  I offer a new MPAA law...\""""R\"""" = No children at all in theaters.  I don't care if they are teenagers.  That's fine with me I'm talking 0 to 12 year olds.  There are other people here you know.  Being an adult.  I hate when little tykes are running up and down the aisles.   Or kids trying to talk to there buddies.  Case in point I saw The newest Harry Potter this summer with my gf and two kids sat behind us.  Apparently only one of them had read the books and/or saw the movies.  The other had done neither.  I had only seen the movies so I had no idea what was happening.  It's hard to watch a movie when you have one trying to explain the previous 34 books.  Then having the other kid get confused.  This is where it got unbearable the turd said, \""""Don't worry I read the book, I'll tell you what happens.\""""  Meanwhile this 4 or 5 year old is running up and done the aisles and out of the corner of my eye I see that horrid glare of a cell phone screen and not an ordinary cell phone screen but one of those big ol' dingleberries.  I prefer downloading now.  If you go on a date Do Not got to Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville.  For some reason I thought it would be a good idea (I'll wirte a review on that later...maybe..if I get good reviews on this one) Sorry this review is so long.  I just have a lot to say.  I wanted to be really thorough, but I think I might have rambled a bit.  But bear with me folks I'm almost finished.  Okay I'm done."""""""
3	Great concept my nephews requested I take them there when I was visiting from out of town. We really had a wonderful time, I just wish the staff was a tad bit more friendly for the amount of money we paid for being there. I get it, its annoying explaining how the process works for each person that walks through the door but, I never done this before so I was asking questions.. seemed the employee was a little frustrated which was annoying. But, I stuck it through because that's what my nephews wanted. Other then that this place was fun for adults and the kids. Very therapeutic, quiet and allowed your inner creative side to shine through. Great amount of colors to work with and supply. I would do it again with them but, hopefully the person at the front desk could smile more often!
2	I'm astonished that Bell Cleaners has survived the recent Recession let alone the last 30 years. The pickup and drop-off experience, which they tout in the About narrative on their web site, is non-existent, and was only memorable due to incompetence. \nToday I waited 15 minutes, in the dark, while the only attendant on site searched aimlessly for my order, stopping five times to check her incoming text messages no less. Once she finally located my 11 shirts and 2 pair of khakis, she offered no apology or explanation and simply stuck her hand out, in silence, in what I deduced was a request for payment. What's worse is that they wanted nearly $15 for two pair of basic khakis. When I asked about the high price the attendant looked downward and mouthed something incoherent, again sticking her hand out. \nI will say that $22.55 for 11 shirts is reasonable, but not so great a deal that I won't go elsewhere. If you have money (and time) to burn on martinizing, be my guest.
4	This place is about 2 miles from my house, I have driven past it at least 100 times in all the years I've been living here, yet I have never stopped...until they offered a Groupon.  I LOVE YOU, GROUPON!    We walked in the door, and the hostess greeted us immediately and sat us.  What an adorable place, very clean, low lighting, but not so low you can't see anything.  And the food, oh my, the food.  I had a stuffed chile rellano, so good.  And pumpkin flan, even better.  This is an adorable place with good service, fantastic food.  A little expensive for Mexican food, but definitely worth it.
3	We use the softball fields here for 12-yr-old's baseball practice.  I know nothing about the racquet side of things.\n\nThe softball fields are OK.  Three fields are well lit but one (the SE field) is terribly lit.  It's unevenly lit and it's not OK.  All the fields are typical of other public Glendale city fields - they are hard with a little dirt spread around every day or so.  They are overdue for some new infield dirt and the grass outfields are simply unimpressive.  I'd probably score them lower but the fact that we have lit fields at all is a good thing.
4	I love steak. It's my favorite food, my dying wish, my best friend and my version of PMS Ice Cream. I really, truly love steak. Some people (my mother) attribute it to my O+ Blood Type, others to my very outdoorsy/hunting family, and my vegetarian friends just think it's because I'm nuts. But no matter the reason, it's the best thing since The Big Bang. For this reason, I feel uniquely qualified to review a steakhouse, and even more so because I once worked at one of the best in the state.\n\nAs a college student who has a discriminating palate and a thin wallet, I take advantage of good deals when I find 'em - and The Keg has an AMAZING deal for you. For your birthday and/or anniversary, they send you an email redeemable for a free entr\u00e9e of some type. Last year was Caesar Salad, Prime Rib,  and your choice of side. This year is an 8oz Sirloin with the same accoutrements.  So sign up for their birthday/anniversary club, you definitely won't regret it.\n\nThe steak I had last night for my birthday was really pretty good! I'm not much of a sirloin lover - I prefer Rib Eye because of the juicy flavors from more marbling, but this Red Meat Lover would never turn down a steak. The Top Sirloin was tender, moist, and had a really good flavor. AND they cooked it to my perfect Medium-Rare specifications. As my side, I chose the Twice Baked Potato; I wish they had brought me three more, they were so delicious! The Caesar Salad was pretty good, but the dressing wasn't anchovy-ey enough for me. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't kick The Keg out of my bed, and I would probably invite it in. I only go here once a year because it's all I can afford at this point, but if I had the $$$, I would  definitely go back more frequently!!
3	Back East is, well, not back East quality as I know it. I really do detest New York (except for the Metropolitan Museum of Art), but I have to say that the best bagel I have ever had was there. Back East is at least better than the limp sticky things from Einstein's, IMHO. \n\nI worked very near here for many years, and I would have to say that their lunch fare was better than breakfast. Their eggs are microwaved in a disposable plastic container, and I always pictured tiny little carcinogens gleefully nestling into my morning protein. I swear that the majority of the time, the early morning staff was in serious need of a caffeine jolt. Mmmmm, how I loved having some slitty eyed college girl yawn in my face and not cover her mouth. Wake up, bitch, and get my order right, for once!\n\nLunch was far better with a wide variety of quality bagel sandwiches, so satisfying and filling I would never be tempted by the snacks in the breakroom for the rest of the afternoon. The BLT was super yum, with cream cheese, sprouts, and cucumbers as well as the B, the L, and the T.\n\nDrinks are are a little pricey, and I always found the coffee to be just alright. The best cup in the immediate area is Gold Bar, but in the direction I came, it was a bigger pain to get to most mornings. You have worse options in the AM on the corner of Southern and McClintock than Back East Bagels.
4	I'm so glad I saved room for dessert while walking around Old Town. Sugar Bowl looked like an old soda shoppe. There were clips of Family Circus in their menus and autographed copies on the walls and at the cashier station.\n\nI didn't try the food, I came in strickly for some sugary goodness. I went with the desire me banana split, and let me tell you- It will not dissapoint. Strawberry and vanilla ice creams, sliced banana and strawberries, whipped cream and a cherry. Yum!!\n\nThere's also an arcade attached to the restaurant, it looked like it had tables as well, so it'd be great for visiting with kids.
4	Tiggos is a relatively new bar in downtown Phoenix, close to Chase Field. It's a decent place to get a beer before a game. I've never been here when there wasn't a game scheduled, and I've never eaten off their menu either. Candidly, I would only take someone here pre-game because Majerles was too crowded (which, if you're not there early, will always be the case). But in fairness the atmosphere, tv views, and the crowd here are all amenable to a big group of people looking to get a few drinks before walking to Chase. And it is closer than Majerles.
1	"""I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND\n\nWe were excited at first to have Ben become our pool guy.  Unfortunately, he was not able to keep up with our pool and it now has calcium deposits around the entire pool and algae growing in the grout.  \n\nI emailed Ben at the beginning of the week and asked that he come take a look.  He told me he would be out the next day.  After noticing that evening that nothing had been done, I asked Ben to call me.  He said he would swing by the following day. Ben finally came over to look at the pool.  He said that he had brushed it; however, the algae was still there and so were the calcium deposits.  Again, I emailed him and asked for him to call me when he was on his way to service our pool.  \n\nInstead of trying to correct this situation that he caused, Ben emailed me and said \It appears that I am unable to clean your pool as well as you need it to be cleaned on a weekly basis. I think at this point it makes sense to look for another cleaning service for the pool. I'll go ahead and clean it to the best of my abilities today, which will finish out the month of our service. I wish I could do more for you. Thank you for your business.\nI took pictures and emailed them to him.\"""" \n\nI took pictures of the algae and calcium deposits and emailed them to him.  He responded by calling and asking if I still wanted him to come by that day to clean our pool.  I told him that yes I would like for him to come by to get rid of this since we will have to take some time to find a new pool guy.  \n\nSeverely disappointed!  I had to go up to a local pool store to get advice.  After bringing in a sample of our pool water, I was told that there were several issues.  Ultimately, the pool needs to be drained at the end of the season.  I went to a 2nd pool place just to double check that the 1st place wasn't trying to sell me a lot of chemicals.  I didn't tell them about the first place and they had very similar results after doing a water analysis.  \n\nOn Ben's website, it says they do chemical analysis on a weekly basis.  HA!  If he did, he would have know that the alkalinity and pH were way off balance.  So were a few other things.  \n\nAgain, we couldn't believe that Ben left us to clean up a messy pool after being under his company's care.  \n\nBe careful and test your water!"""""""
5	Wow.  It's really intimidating to try to write a review of Noca.  Honestly, it was a culinary experience that I find hard, even now (after some scribbling of notes) to sum up effectively in words.  It was wonderful, unquestionably 5 stars.  I'd recommend it to even my most picky friends, were they in the Phoenix area. \n\nBut how do I explain just *how* enjoyable my food was here? I think that the best I can do is be extremely descriptive:\n\nNow, a disclaimer: I came here with other dining companions, so not everything I sampled did I eat all by myself.  I am neither that gluttonous, nor that flush in the pocketbook!  But, I truly did enjoy every bite. \n\nStarted off with a nice, dry Anselmi Pinot Grigio, and a tempting little morsel that combined mushrooms with a light, flaky pastry. I sampled the spinach mezzaluna. It's silky ricotta melted on the tongue. For my main course, I selected Alaskan halibut. This was some of the best fish I've had.  The flavor of the fish came through, but I think the beurre rouge was\nreally what accounted for that flavor -- while a cinnamon froth added just a slight kiss of sweetness.  The halibut was served with baby fennel and onions in a salsify tart.  The tart crust was wonderfully soft and flaky.\n\nFor dessert, we indulged: The first thing that came seems to be a fun sort of Noca signature -- a large cloud of ultra-fresh cotton candy. We each grasped a nibble or two, but couldn't resist some of the other items on the dessert menu.\n\nThe apple risotto is not risotto *with apples*. Instead, diced apples are cooked in a way that resembles the cooking of risotto.  A dollop of salt and butter ice cream (!) on top balances out the sweetness just right.  We also shared an order of doughnut holes -- cinnamon and sugar with a slightly crispy outside.  Three accompanying dipping sauces added a little extra to our sugar buzz -- my favorite was the dulce de leche. \n\nAll throughout dinner, the restaurant was extremely busy (particularly for a weeknight), but our server didn't skip a beat.  Owner Elliot was making the rounds, telling us more about the restaurant and making recommendations. It's obvious that his heart is in this restaurant completely, and it show (and tastes) accordingly!
1	"""The armpit of my local grocery stores. Freak show central. How many people actually have to grocery shop on those little \Scooter\"""" things.

5	This place is one of the best sushi places (if not the best for their variety and made to orders) we have ever been to.  Each visit, we order something new (and we've been coming here once a week for several months now).  The cut and quality of the sashimi is consistent, the rolls are always prepared immaculately.  The miso soup is perfect.  Do not believe the negative reviews.  Believe the reviews of those of us who come here on a regular basis to enjoy fine quality sushi.  I have never seen this place short staffed, nor have I had a roll that fell apart because it wasn't prepared properly.  We have never waited long for our food, ever.
5	My boyfriend & I went on Saturday, Aug. 4th at around 4:30pm. We were greeted as we walked in & told to take a seat where ever we felt comfortable. Most of the seating is high top tables or at the (high) counter, but there was one table in the corner we found that was perfect (I'm short & not comfortable sitting up high). \n\nOur waiter, Andy, came over right away, a very charming and personable young man. I'm not much of a wine drinker (or a drinker at all!), but was in the mood to give a sweet (inexpensive) wine a try. He recommended a delicious Riesling, a bargain at $12. The food was excellent, fresh & full of flavor. You could taste the quality of ingredients they used. We will definitely be coming back here.
5	I am a movie WHORE. I've rated 2500 movies on Netflix. I used to wait in line for the midnight premieres. Camelview holds some very special memories for me. if it's sheik but not on the AMC, daddy warbucks studio fatheads' approved list, it might get a chance at the Camelview.

5	I am writing a review after having participated in a 3-Day convention at this resort.  I thought the service was top-notch in this area of their business.  The meeting rooms were clean and cool.  The staff was *excellent* ... the management team always smiling and happy, waited on us hand and foot, gave me a tour of the grounds when I got there, and left me with their personal cell phone numbers if I needed anything at all.  I even got a free amenity in my room just because I helped organize the event.  I ate 7 meals total at the event, and I thought they must have a great chef working on these events because the food was *way* better than I expected, even at the saloon bar.  I would go back just to eat.\n\nAs far as my room went, I will say it met my expectations for a $99 room.  There were certain aspects that were a little more rugged, but to me it definitely matched the Arizona old west feeling.  Free Wi-Fi was available with no hassle throughout the rooms and lobby.  The cleaning staff and room service folks were all super nice!  I want to note that I left my keyboard at home by accident and needed to do a bunch of typing during the three days.  I told the front desk expecting they would either shrug me off or want to charge me some kind of A/V fee.  Nope, they let me borrow an extra keyboard they had overnight! \n\nThe only area I wish I could change was connecting to internet in the meeting rooms.  They only offered paid Wi-Fi there, and the price was $200 per computer.  I assume it's surely not something they sell very often at that price point. We went without, so to check email quickly between meetings I had to go all the way to the lobby.  Understandable policy, but wish there was some way around it.  Still I am giving the resort overall a strong 5 stars.
4	Went with my husband to Richardson's/Rokerij for the first time. He raved about this place. We went on a Wednesday night, with no reservation. The wait was about 1 hour. Luckily there were 2 bar seats that became available, so we took them. We ordered the 3 cheese flatbread appetizer and it was delicious. I had a large salad for dinner which was perfect, as I was not very hungry. My husband had the chicken enchiladas that I tasted and were very good. The food is cooked to order so it did take a while to get our meal, but it was worth the wait and service was excellent. While waiting, we chatted with several people at the bar, and one couple offered us a taste of their appetizer. We returned the favor, when flatbread came. One more thing, do not leave without getting the decadent truffle dessert. Heavenly, but not over done in any way. All in all a great experience. I do recommend reservations.
4	This review is long overdue. Partially because I keep telling myself that I'm going to write a review after the next time I go to Khyber Halal. So, after our 4th dining experience there, here I go!\n\nThe first time we tried to go to Khyber Halal, we were able to go inside the restaurant but they told us they weren't doing dinner service because they were catering a banquet dinner off site. No problem, we made arrangements to go back a few weeks later. Our next visit was during Ramadan. We didn't know that until we arrived to see a big sign on the door saying that they were observing the month long holiday. \n\nNot to be deterred, we came back a few weeks later and were seated by a friendly, young man (presumably, the owner's son?) and we waited. and waited. Finally, about 10 minutes later, I was able to call someone over to take our order and get waters for the table. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, mantoo, samosas and brown rice. The samosas were a bit dry and the chutney that was served with them was nice but in styrofoam containers. I have absolutely nothing but positive things to say about the rest of the meal. Fantastic, flavorful and probably impossible to beat for the prices at this restaurant. Our waters weren't refilled throughout our meal but we almost didn't notice because the food was so good. We didn't need to order extra naan as they make sure you get enough bread to feed an army. With an appetizer, a few sides and three entrees, our meal was less than $40. \n\nOur next 3 visits were a bit more of the same. Lackluster service, outstanding food. It's why we keep going back. I keep saying I wish someone would nominate Khyber Halal for a Restaurant Impossible or Kitchen Nightmares type show. They need a visual makeover and the sons could take a lesson in service. Again, they are super friendly but have probably never worked in a restaurant before. This place would be a 5 if they could get their skills up to par a bit. \n\nDon't let the service keep you away. If this place was around the corner from me, I'd be here a few times a week for lunch. See you soon Khyber!
2	"""As much as I like the service here, it's the unabashed lies and endless waiting amid gaggles of shrilly giggling Xavier girls that has chapped my ass to the point where I'm done with this place. They have a handy trick of popping you in the pedicure throne with your feet in the water without telling you how long the wait is, and by the time you've realized it's going to be forty minutes' wait, it seems like more of a hassle to get up and dry your feet. Clever me started asking how long the wait was as soon as I walked through the door, at which point someone inevitably looks around and lies through their teeth when they say \10 or 15 minutes\"""". Multiply that by three and maybe you get the truth. Once I even made an appointment, trying to avert frustration, but my payoff was that I \""""only\"""" waited 20 minutes. C'mon, people, it's plain old rude to lie, so as much as I love the neck and shoulder massages, I'm done..."""""""
5	"""I'm giving Tea Light Cafe an extra star (well deserved) for being an independent restaurant in the middle of corporate-eatery-Scottsdale. But rest assured, the food, value and experience merit a solid 4 stars if not higher. I dine here often and every meal has been spot on. Ethnic food is a staple of mine and Vietnamese dining is always a treat; I think it's healthier than other varieties, but what do I know. I'm still eating off value menus.\n\nI've had the Pho several times, and it's very good; but I'm not a big Pho fan. It's soup. I don't care how big the bowl is... soup is not a meal. It's an appetizer. If I want a light meal, I order their Spring Rolls. They're loaded with shrimp and some other meat (I think it's pork) and the wrapping is see-through. I can see what's inside the roll.  I love them. Yes they are appetizers too, so if you follow my philosophy, they should not count as a meal either.  But they are shaped like hot dogs, which are a meal. Are you following this?\n\nMy favorite dish is \The Number 3\"""" which is a huge bowl filled with rice noodles, grilled beef, lots of veggies and it's topped with an awesome egg roll. See the pic uploaded by Renick T. That's my dish and I'm sticking with it. This dish is featured at many Vietnamese establishments.  Tea Light does it very well. When I eat this dish, the entire world comes into balance and I feel an inner connection to the universe.  The Buddha statutes in the shop come to life and smile lovingly upon me, my meal, my table and my pals.  OOOOOHHHHHMMMMMM."""""""
4	It was very good.\n\nChicken was tasty but a bit overcooked.\n\nWaffles were phenomenal with a hint of cinnamon.\n\nMac and cheese was perfect along with the home-style fries.\n\nI liked the fact they used mason jars for glasses. That is something I do at home also. \n\nI am still wondering why people are putting up pictures of another location.  Check out my recent upload for what it really looks like outside. It is a tad scary but that just makes me want to investigate even further. \n\nI expected it to be cheaper than it was. Oh well!
3	"""We went to Beckett's Table the first night of AZ Restaurant Week.  The atmosphere is a little like Chelsea's Kitchen, but I really liked it.  My husband and I started with the chopped salad and the chicken meatballs.  The salad was super fresh, really nice.  The meatballs were amazing.  The sauce was very smokey, which actually tasted better the longer it sat, the meatballs could have been served \naked\""""...they were delish!!!  We both got the green chile stew for our entrees, my husband enjoyed it, I thought it was a bit on the sweet side, especially as it cooled off.  Dessert was the s'more with chocolate covered bacon, a dish you definitely have to try to appreciate.  Took a few bites to get used to it, but it was really tasty, the marshmallow was fantastic.\n\nI look forward to going back and try some other things on the menu."""""""
5	I have eaten here over 200 times. So as you read you can see this as a regular's bias or as an Oregano's expertise opinion.\n\nFirst of all, don't ever waste your time with the sandwiches. They are too big, the bread is too hard, and you can find something better down the street at Cheba Hut. The meatball sandwich is ok, however you would be better served to simply order a side of the meatballs. \n\nAs for what you should order, let's start with pasta. There are four or five pastas that will change your life. The first is the Big Rig. It is rigatoni pasta with a creamy chipotle tomato sauce. It has a good amount of heat, but that can be countered by ordering it with grilled shredded chicken. The Big Rig is my favorite dish. The Bollo Pasta is excellent (with chicken or meatballs), the Ziti is good (although the bread bowl is gross and kitschy), the alfredo the dark is also nice and lighter than most of the other pastas. I would also recommend the big ol' ravioli if you are in to ricotta but make sure to order it with the sausage or meatballs. Mmmmmm. The chicken lasagna is also amazing...but it takes 25 minutes and is often over cooked.\n\nNow to the pizza. The thin crust is great. The pan is average .The deep dish is special. I have had Giordano's, Uno's, Lou Maltati's, even Pacxi's in SF...none of them compare to Oregano's. It takes 45 minutes, but grab some boom dip, a beer, and enjoy the AZ heat while you wait for pizza heaven. I recommend just getting sausage and peppers. Classic Chicago.\n\nYou must end all meals with a Pizzookie. This is not a BJ's quality pizookie. This is perfectly undercooked cookie (PB, chocolate chip, or white chocolate macademia) topped with a generous portion of vanilla ice cream. The best part is the crusty edges. Yum, yum, yum.\n\nA warning: portions are HUGE. You will be better served to split something or you will exit this restaurant like you are 5 months pregnant. \n\nI have been to all of the locations, including Flagstaff and Tucson, and the Tempe digs are definitely the best and most consistent. Go early or expect quite a wait. Especially during the school year.\n\nEnjoy!
5	"""Have been here twice and both times a fantastic experience.   Have had several things on the menu and here is what I recommend.   To drink:  Cosmo Fresh.   I had never had a cosmo before.   Decided to try this and it was one of the best drinks I have ever had. The Smoke and Ginger Margarita is great also.  Definitely very smoky.  Would not recommend the \New Fashioned Old Fashioned.\""""   Entree:   Trout, Halibut (when they have it for a special), filet.   I have had the wedge salad and it was fantastic but they recently have changed the menu and it is no longer available.   Would not recommend the Pear Salad.   Not enough pears or blue cheese.  Crab cakes and brie are great for appetizers.  S'mores for dessert.  Don't miss the pretzel bread.   The service is great and the decor is beautiful.   Great place for a special date."""""""
1	My sister recently took her '98 VW New Beetle to First Class Auto in Scottsdale, AZ for an overheating issue.  I'm normally the one who does the maintenance on the vehicle but I was ~600 miles away.  She described the symptoms as follows: overheating light came on while she was stuck in construction traffic and went back off once she was moving again.  I immediately suggested that the radiator fans may not be coming on for some reason.  Since I wasn't around to look at it, she took it to First Class Auto.\n\nShe relayed the symptoms to the guys at First Class and also SPECIFICALLY requested they check  radiator fan functionality.\n\nThey told her the water pump was cracked and leaking, needed a new thermostat and also replace the timing belt and serpentine belt while they were in there (water pump is driven by the timing belt on this engine--2.0L 8V 4 cyl AEG code).  Well, a) I personally replaced the timing belt, water pump and serpentine belt about 10,000 miles ago as preventative maintenance.  What's more is the car hasn't lost any coolant since the job.  So the water pump being cracked is highly unlikely!  I did not replace the thermostat, though.  Once she called me to tell me this, I told her to decline the work and either take it somewhere else or wait for me to make a trip out.\n\nI had a job to do that brought me almost half way to the Phoenix area so I decided I would make the trip the rest of the way to have a look for myself yesterday.  FIRST thing I did was check the radiator fans.  I turned on the AC and the fans didn't come on at all.  I pop the cover off the strip fuse panel that resides on top of the battery and found a melted 30 AMP fuse.  Guess what that fuse is for?  The RADIATOR FANS!  Imagine that.  Being a car that lived most of its life in Michigan, some of the fuses and the fuse panel itself had become corroded and caused the one fuse and part of the fuse panel to melt.  The coolant level was exactly at the max level, right where it was after I did the maintenance on it 10,000 miles ago, not to mention I checked it before her recent trip to Scottsdale (didn't have to add anything.  The car doesn't leak a drop of coolant).\n\nLocal dealer had a new fuse panel in stock, I swapped it out and replaced all 3 of the 30 amp blade fuses as they were all corroded pretty badly.  The larger strip fuses were still decent.  The radiator fans now work as normal and the car does not overheat.  The hose coming off the thermostat also becomes pressurized and hot at the correct temperature as well, so that's definitely not a problem!  Fans also come on automatically once the coolant temp hits 99 deg Celsius like they're supposed to.  Problem solved!\n\nI drove down to First Class Auto today to give them a chance to explain/defend themselves, but there was only one guy working in the shop who she didn't recognize and no one at the counter.  What great customer service!\n\nSo she COULD have spent the quoted $800 and STILL had the same problem!  She just got dinged for a ~$40 diagnostic fee... for an incorrect diagnosis.
4	MMM Chicos. I have been coming here for years and it has consistantly been delicious. It is one of the places we bring out of town guests to.\n\nThis is a pay-at-the-counter type place, but much much better than any type of ____bertos. \n\nThey have lard free beans and a salsa bar with several different types and they give you chips to munch on before your meal.\n\nThe portions are extremely generous, especially if you get the california burro. I weighed it and it was literally a pound.\n\nThe tostadas come in a shell, and are kind of a mix between a tostada and a taco salad, but the veggie tostada is my favorite. get the guac and sour cream and you have the best mexican food around.\n\nThe California burro and the quesedillas are also really good. My boyfriends mom will drive from Apache Junction just to get the steak quesedilla.\n\nThe restaurant is brightly colored and has upbeat mexican music playing. Good location with lots of parking, and its right next to a Starbucks.\n\nAnd if my review wasnt enough to convince you, I can almost guarantee that you will see cops eating there if you go. I think that says something :)\n\nPS I think they are closed on Sundays
5	I was a boba virgin, so to speak, so I really can't compare this to any other boba joints. Either way, it was a wonderful experience! I went with the chocolate peanut butter milk smoothie with boba. My husband got a fruit smoothie mixed with strawberry, kiwi, and mango (plus boba of course). We tried each other's, both were amazing! My smoothie was very filling, I had to save the last third for later! They are also very generous with the boba. \n\nThe cafe itself is very hip. There are various graffiti-like drawings all over the walls, and a cupboard stacked with flyers for things like other Asian restaurants, spas, anime cons, raves, and other miscellany. \n\nWe went in literally a minute before they were about to close, so it wasn't busy at all. We were the only folks there. \n\nI plan on being a regular here! I'm glad to know they have punch cards.
4	My boyfriend and I love getting Breakfast at local owned businesses. We try to go almost every week. Lately, we've been a little underwhelmed with our selection in Tempe, and have been haunting Denny's. No bueno. We looked to Yelp to see what we may have missed and found Mark's. And I think we now have a new default place! Great Hollandaise, just like previous reviewers suggested. Tangy, sweet awesome! I had the French eggs benny on a croissant with prosciutto. Holy taste buds!  BF had a spicy version, the Southwestern eggs Benny, and he loved his too. His only beef was wanting more of the potatoes they serve on the side. Compared to some of the humongous waffles and pancakes we saw coming out, eggs Benedict was a really tasty, but smaller portion. Especially after our Grand Slam slumming at Denny's. Overall - Mark's Cafe is delicious, local and full of friendly staff and patrons!
5	"""First off, if you're coming from the West on Indian School pay attention to the sign that says Milagro Grill is in 400 yards or feet or whatever it says.  Otherwise it's sort of hard to find. The address is 4280 E. Indian School.  It's right across the street from another of my favorite spots, La Fontanella's if that helps!\n\n First thing in the door, we were greeted enthusiastically by the Host.  She welcomed us and seated us with a terrific attitude.  Then Katie, our server greeted us and took our drink order.  Water was brought out right away.  We decided on Iced Tea, as opposed to an alcoholic beverage.  It was eleven in the morning and I don't want to appear to be a total lush!  The Iced Tea was nice and strong, the way I like it.  Black tea and plenty of it!\n\nThe manager Jared Johnson came over and introduced himself. We discussed my gluten free status and he said he was trying to learn very quickly about gluten free eating.  He said that the kitchen was very good about knowing how to prepare gluten free foods and he was trying to make sure they do things right.  Everything is made fresh onsite, which should help with that!  They seem very concerned about making their customer's dietary needs a priority.\n\n While we were talking, my husband commented that I loved guacamole and he'd read that their guac was amazing so Jared sent their homemade guacamole out, which is made fresh, with home made chips and their salsa de la casa, made with cascabel chili.This House Salsa was so smokey and flavorful without having a \traditional\"""" salsa taste.  It was kind of a nutty flavor which just has to be tried!\n  \nLooking over the Brunch menu did have it's drawbacks.  The names and descriptions were sort of baffling.  Something they MIGHT want to think about changing.....but Katie was great about explaining each one!  I had the Enfrijoladas, which was basically chicken enchiladas with a white bean and tomatillo sauce....topped with an egg (I opted for scrambled).  I was blown away by the smokey taste of the chicken.  It also had some cheese but what I loved was the bean and tomatillo puree.  There was definitely a smooth hotness factor but it was so subtle and appealing that I really enjoyed it.\n\nMy husband opted for the Chorizo Con Huevos which was a flatbread with a very mild Chorizo, some charred tomato, potato and cheese with an egg on top.  He really enjoyed it and thought that the flavors went very well together.  He said the only thing he'd change is maybe have the egg on the side.  But who doesn't love pizza for breakfast?\n\n We were really blown away with the quality of the food as well as the super efficient staff.  They have a smokin' hot terrific happy hour as well, which we are going back for specifically!  I want to try a Milagro Margarita!\n\n  The gorgeous Retro '70's feel to the decor and the large, easy to sit in chairs impressed me!\n\nOh, did I happen to mention they are the 2012 AZ Taco Festival Grand Champion's?  When you go in just take a look at all the awards they have received.  Quite impressive and I know WHY!  These people know how to cook and how to serve a customer. .  I am impressed!"""""""
3	A couple years ago, I hated this place and stayed far, far away.  But, my beloved India Palace on 27th Avenue and Bell Road was randomly closed so off to Indian Maharaja Palace we went.  I was very surprised.  It was actually good.  I liked the vegetable korma, garlic naan, papadum (spicy chips), vegetable pakoras and mango kulfi (ice cream).  The owner was very friendly.  I would give this place a try and not automatically dismiss it, like I had for several years.  I'm glad I did and will be back.
5	"""Everyone knows that Tony Soprano didn't die, HBO merely made the ending ambiguous so that America would be shielded from the awful truth that he was planning to move away from the East Coast to none other than Scottsdale, Arizona. Why you ask? Because where else can you carry on business dealings in a strip joint, be involved in \waste management\"""", act out of control all the time, philander, defraud the government...and fit right in? But for he and many other recent transplants from Jersey, the truth is part of Scottsdale's allure rests with places like DeFalco's Italian Grocery.\n\nSitting in a worn strip mall in an older section of town, the scene almost evokes a little hint of the Garden State. However, the good news is that I've never seen anyone whacked in the spacious parking lot...or wearing a Members Only jacket for that matter. Upon entering, there's a claustrophobic sensation as you see the grocery aisles creating a slightly labyrinthine path to the deli counters, which are separate based on ordering prepared or raw food. Upon reaching the prepared food aisle, you'll invariably see a microcosm of Scottsdale, ranging from senior citizens to high schools girls using platinum cards to buy lunch for the whole family. (Luckily though, no sign of Carmine Gotti just yet.) \n\nThe menu? It's a pageant of sumptuous meats and cheeses, and they even offer I-talian soda to go with. It's so good, you might think like many a famous eatery it's a front for the local outfit. While I don't believe that to be true...(it is Arizona after all) the owners certainly make purists and old school Italian food fans happy with its inclusion of more traditional meat choices like capacollo. The food also will seem dry, but that's only because they are careful not to drown out the meat's character with too much mayo or other condiments. Some may not like it.\n\nPrice-wise, this place is pretty much a steal. It's a shade more expensive than Subway, but not much more-so. But as Scottsdale goes, it's almost unbeatable. They also accept plastic and have a loyalty card, so as you can imagine, you'll want to come back often if you know what is good for you.\n\nSince it's a deli, there's no waitstaff. Still, service is total class. People are friendly, and professional so that it still feels family-owned and not corporate. The tables are usually clean in the seating area, and spaced evenly enough that you won't feel like someone just broke your legs.\n\nBut then there is the one detraction to this place: the supposedly endless wait for your order. I've never been on a weekday, but weekends I have found are pretty manageable. For some people it won't  be like Jack-in-the-Box, but if you order ahead you should avoid some of the hassle.\n\nOf course, part of the allure going to an Italian restaurant in the cultural attitude about savoring life, food and a slower pace than our Anglo-Saxon roots ultimately prefer. Unless, that is, you have reservations to Buca di Beppo...but that's another story entirely."""""""
5	This is the best facility of its kind that I've ever encountered -- so good that I have bought its stock, assuming lots of Boomers will find their way to the top-of-the-line fitness experience. I've been a member for more than a year. The trainer I work with is extremely competent and professional. The equipment selection is vast and well-maintained. I get my hair cut in the salon, and I use one of the massage therapists (although this is the facility's only weak spot; staff skills here are mediocre to poor).
3	I guess they were okay for a CHAIN, in a MALL.  Service was quick and even gave us free endame, I know, that's not much but it's something.  Just had a few rolls all of which were fine.  3 of the 4 rolls were about the size as a coffee cup, way too big for a humans mouth.  So what's a person do with rolls that are too big?\n\nDo you: \n\nA) Push the entire roll in you pie-hole and hope no food falls out when you start chewing.\nB) Cut up the roll with a knife and fork.\nC) Use your chopsticks to pick apart the roll into small bite size portions.\n\nHave your answer ready before you visit this place.

2	"""Yelp Mobile App...you have steered me toward better dining opportunities.\n\nOn searching out the location, we were not impressed with the location...located in the corner of a nearly dead strip mall...we thought this was the hidden gem in the Tempe italian world.  We were somewhat embarassed after we ordered, especially with friends from Milan in our party.\n\nOn pulling up to the restaurant, we walked in and waited at the 'seating stand'.  The waitress came after about 5 minutes (she was working to deliver orders to the folks at tables), asking how many were dining and where we would like to sit.  We let her know we were ordering to go, and she motioned us to the bar.\n\nOn arriving at the bar and not sitting, we were asked if we were ordering to go or to eat in.  We let the person requesting our order know that we would be ordering to go.  She brought up her pen and order pad and asked what we would order.  We ordered a mushroom/pepperoni/sausage pie sufficient for 4.  Waitress asked if we would wait for our order, and when we said we would go to Big Lots in the same mall, she said we would wait 35-40 minutes for our order.  \n\nWe walked out and down to Big Lots, finding a few items we could not pass up.  Leaving Big Lots at 30 minutes after we placed our order, we proceeded to put our purchases in the vehicle and headed back to the restaurant to pick up dinner.  When we arrived, the waitress advised we were early, and would we like a beer or glass of wine while we waited.  We declined and stood waiting for the pizza we ordered.\n\nWhat was delivered 10 minutes later was a 12-inch pie.  While we anticipated a pizza that was sufficiently loaded to take care of 4 people dining, we were sadly disappointed.  We took the pizza we ordered and drove a mile to the homestead.  When we arrived and opened the box, we were all underwhelmed at the toppings.  There were 2 strips of sausage, 5 pepperoni slices and 5 mushroom slices.  \n\nWhile I was reminded that we should have opened the box at the restaurant, I replied that we should give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.  Was I mistaken?  ABSOLUTELY!  Being hungry, I resisted the normal 'check it out before leaving' concept. \n\n$19.25 for a 12\ pizza with such minimal toppings, I was directed to return to the restaurant with the insufficient pizza.  On arriving back at the restaurant, I was told that since I left before lodging my dissatisfaction, nothing would be done about the order I placed, as I might have \""""peeled toppings off to express my dissatisfaction\"""". \n\nIf you want to spend too much money for a pizza, this is the place to go."""""""
5	My father in law took us to this wonderful place when we were visiting him and it made such a great impression on us that we decided to have our rehersal diner here! (We had destination wedding.) The food is fantastic and the ambiance is classy but not stuffy. We felt very comfortable and taken care of here. When organizing our rehersal dinner, the communication to and from the restaurant was prompt and detailed. They printed special menu for us with our names on the top - it was a nice touch and great addition to our wedding scrapbook. We are looking forward coming here again whenever we are back in Arizona.
5	Love it!  If you're a member, you get coupons in the mail, and occasionally coupons for free stuff...something Sam's doesn't do.\n\nMy friend first told me she thought she might be pregnant here.  (I suggested she get the Costco sized variety pack of pregnancy tests but she thought otherwise...)\n\nAccepts credit cards, but only AMEX as far as I know.\n\nI get my tires, much of my food, my TV, some clothes, booze, plants, etc all  here.  I heart Costco!\n\n(One good thing/annoyance is when you get tires, they fill them with Nitrogen.  Lasts a long time, but most of the quickie oil change type places refuse to put regular air in your tires when you need a fillup..even though it's supposedly ok to do so)
3	I wanted this place to be good, really I did.  I got the cheese ravioli with marinara and it wasn't anything special.  Though to be fair, my favorite is the Fazoli's cheese ravioli.  \n\nIt was basically just not worth any hype that I could see.  Maybe the pizza or cream sauces are where it's at and I missed out, but unfortunately I doubt I'll be willing to try again.\n\nThe guy in charge was very friendly but it was annoying how inattentive the original waiter was especially considering how small the place is.
2	After reading all the raves about the green chili mac & cheese it was a must have - and then immediate regret. The green chilies were chewy and not peeled properly and the cheese in the mac was grainy and gritty. Yuck. Mac & cheese is by definition...cheesy and smooth. Not this. Horrible. The good side was the pulled pork sandwich and the hot BBQ was pretty darn good. All in all when I want good BBQ my choice would be Honey Bears first. But if I'm hard up and just gotta have some BBQ, I would consider Andrew's again.
4	3.5 stars, so I rounded up.\n\nThe first Saturday of the month is free, so I decided to escape the heat and visit the Historical Society museum. It turned about to be a very nice almost two hour escape. \n\nThe downstairs exhibits are great. Lots of information, photos, and artifacts. Right now the exhibits are Sandra Day O'Connor, Play Ball, and a sneak peak into museum storage. Each exhibit has its own room, so there is a (usually) calm feeling as you pace around the room.\n\nUpstairs seems to hold the permanent exhibits about Western life, the Roosevelt Dam, Arizona agriculture, and Arizona life. Lots of artifacts, information, and interactive exhibits. \n\nI really wish there were more museum employees -- someone to safe guard the artifacts and the other visitors. First Saturdays are popular days with families, meaning little kids will run around and they will run into you. (Happened maybe four times today... I guess I'm invisible?) I got to the museum before noon and left around 1:45. About 1, I felt overwhelmed with the screaming and yelling young visitors, which caused me to rush through the WWII exhibit and the Desert Life exhibit upstairs. \n\nMy suggestion: If you have kids in tow, come to the museum around 1. There will be a few kids to play with your kid. If you are child free and loving it, come to the museum between 10-12 on first Saturday.
4	"""I must be in the minority here, but I've never understood the \gotta have it\"""" appeal of ice cream or frozen yogurt. Sure, Cold Stone is good, but it's just ice cream. And there are so many places to get frozen yogurt, and they're all the same, so who really cares? I'm typically happy just getting a sample and then watching my friend eat their ice cream or yogurt. I think Mojo changed me a little.\n\nA few weeks ago, my friends and I happened to walk by Mojo Yogurt at the Biltmore, and I was unexpectedly compelled to walk in and check it out. Maybe it was the super-cool all-red interior, or the huge selection of yogurt toppings. But i think what struck me first is that the yogurt machines weren't behind the counter, but in the back of the store, ready for self-service. \n\nSince I first visited Mojo, I've been told about a place called Yogurtology in Scottsdale that employs the same concept - self-service yogurt, so I guess Mojo isn't a trendsetter, but this was my first time seeing it, and I liked it. \n\nWhat i liked even better was that there were stacks of small sample cups, so I could just walk to each machine and taste whatever i wanted. My first thought was, \""""I wonder why they do this - who's going to buy anything when you can just sample as much as you want?\"""". I proceeded to each machine, filling up my sample cups. And then I was hooked. \n\nThis stuff is good. Each dispenser has a cool little Sony LCD monitor on top telling you which flavor it holds, and all of them are delicious. I was impressed with the tart flavor - kind of reminds me of the taste of Kugel (you jews will know what I'm talking about), and it's phenomenal. The Birthday Cake flavor is similar to Cold Stone's Cake Batter, but in a lower-calorie yogurt form. \n\nOf course I gave in and bought some. You just grab one of 2 sizes of paper cups and fill it with whatever flavor(s) you want. Take what you want, since you're paying only $.39 per ounce. Be careful, though - the cups are huge (probably by design, so you buy more), so exercise a little restraint. \n\nAfter choosing flavors, I walked to the topping station and went crazy - there are lots to choose from. Maybe you got turned on to mochi balls at Pinkberry. Well I bet Pinkberry doesn't have at least four flavors of mochi balls! Mojo does. And then there's all sorts of fresh cut up fruit, along with your standard-grade toppings. They even have Smarties and Cadbury's \""""Twirl\"""" chocolate bars. Amazing. It's nice to take what you like and not pay $1.00 per topping.\n\nFinally, put your cup on the scale and pay. It gets heavy fast, so be careful. And be sure to grab a stamp card if you like it, so you can get a free one down the road.\n\nI do agree with another reviewer that sometimes the yogurt comes out wet and melty because people don't close the levers all the way. Also, when the line is long, it moves slowly, but it's not a huge deal.\n\nOverall, I'm impressed with Mojo - it's better than most yogurt I've tasted, and I'll be visiting again."""""""
4	"""I went out on St. Patrick's Day for the first time EVER. I met up with some friends at Oconnors to enjoy some live music and beer. I had a great time and the bands were a lot of fun. \nThere is something about pounding your hand on the table to the beat and clapping your hands while drinking a glass of your favorite beer. \nThe corn beef a cabbage was also good. It was my first time eating it. Not bad. I would eat it again. :) \nAll in all I had a good time and as the sign on the door says \Welcome to Oconnors where your only a stranger once\"""". \nI look forward to going back"""""""
5	This place just opened two weeks ago and I have already been there twice.  Great pizza, great bread sticks, and a great price.  I am a pizza addict so I have tried a ton of different pizza places in Scottsdale, and Phoenix.  I think this is the best so far.  Great topping selection, great crust, and it all tastes good too!\n\nI got the pizza to go both times, and they have been nice and warm each time.  No complaints.  Will definitely be going there again!  Maybe this weekend!
4	Been here one time. May 17, 2010 about 5:30pm. The place was not very busy. It was clean, appeared to be well staffed. Servings were on the large size. I had their hot pastrami sandwich and fries. Both were very good. My cousin had a baked chicken and deep fried onions pieces. He said both were very good. The service was excellent. We got served in about 16 minutes from order to plates. Drinks were filled without asking. We left an above average tip, I will most likely return. We had dinner for two and left after paying about $39 after tip and tax.\n\nEasy access off Tatum inside Paradise Valley Mall on the east side.
3	On occasion I get the urge for a big old Italian grinder.  In my neighborhood I know exactly where to go to to satisfy this craving, but I have no clue where to go in North Scottsdale.  I took a chance on Capriotti's.\n\nThe restaurant was packed, but the staff was very efficient in getting food out.  Grinder in hand, I head back to work to try it out.\n\nThe sandwich was huge, easily big enough for two meals.  As for the flavor?  It was ok, but not exactly memorable. All of the components were there, but the sandwich as a whole didn't stand out.\n\nI'm willing to try the 'Best Sandwich in America' at least once, but I won't be going back for the grinder.
4	This adorable little coffee shop is right off Ray road. If you blink, you may miss the turn!!! Lively environment with Wi-Fi internet makes this a great place for study groups. Only bad thing about this place is how small the parking lot is because most times it's full!\n\nAs far as food goes-they serve breakfast omelettes, burritos, and sandwiches. The club sandwich is DECLICIOUS on wheat bread (I haven't tried anything else yet because I'm stuck on this one for now). This club is loaded with avocado, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and thick turkey slices.  All of their vegetables come from a local farm and are fresh & full of flavor :-D\n\nAs far as cupcakes-I've tried the birthday cake, chocolate chip cookie dough, red velvet, and the chocolate peanut butter cupcakes. My absolute favorites are the chocolate chip cookie dough and the chocolate peanut butter cupcakes.  The chocolate chip cookie dough has mini chocolate chips throughout the cupcake and the cookie-dough frosting!! SO GOOD!! The chocolate peanut butter cupcake's frosting tastes similar to the inside peanut butter of a Reese's peanut butter cup. Every cupcake I've tried from here is always moist and delicious!
3	We just moved here and had a family-from out of town- dinner here.  We are searching and trying to find some favorite restaurants.  Spotted Donkey is a great space, open and well decorated.  They sat us at an uncomfortable table for 5, but I think there are no good tables for 5.  \n\nThe waiter started to ask about drinks and responded to an innocent question about types of tequila with a 7 minute monologue about the special tequilas they buy and how awesome the margaritas are.  It was 7 minutes more about tequila than I really wanted to know.  Especially since the margaritas ended up being inconsistent from one drink to the next.  Other than the tequila rant, the service was outstanding. \n\nWe started with an order of guacamole.  And they really did charge $11 for a small scoop of guacamole and  $7 for chips and salsa.  At that point I'm not sure I cared that they were good.  I ordered the squash quesadillas.  The veggies were crisp and it was tasty.  I enjoyed them.  But other folks didn't care for the mole, or the enchiladas.
5	I am fairly new to Yelp, and the restaurant reviews, and it is more than a bit confusing.\nWhen I looked at reviews for this restaurant, I was thinking that perhaps we should not go - there were so many negative comments about the, staff and/or the food.  But we went anyway.\nAnd, I've got to tell you that the entire evening was terrific!  We chose the full 6 course dinner with wine paring.  Not only was the food fantastic, but the staff could not have been more professional, caring, and just plain terrific.  \nThere were 8 of us for dinner, yet the kitchen turned out the food on a perfectly timed basis, and was overall an awesome evening.\nIn the future, if I use Yelp, I will only read the positive comments, those with negative comments are probably just not too happy generally......
4	During both spring training and the MSBL tournament, we usually come here. Either we are getting in shape for our season or SG is working something out during the tournament. Either way, we are at the batting cages at some point. We nearly never do anything else here, but there are lots of options. \n\nThere are about 8 cages for batting. 3 of them have slow pitch softball, 1 fast pitch softball, and the rest varying speeds of baseball. I, of course, stick to the slow pitch. I typically hit around 80-100 pitches. They are $1.25 for 20 pitches. Pretty reasonable! So many places really jack up the price, but this place is fair. \n\nThe pitching machines are pretty accurate. We really have not had any trouble with them. They can get crowded, but at least people cannot reserve a cage by time. The cages themselves are outdoor and you can hit and actually see where your ball goes. I love that part, it seems more real. I had when you hit in a box, you really have no concept of distance. I know its all about form, but end result goes a long way!\n\nWe will just keep going back to this place. It is very convenient to where we stay in Scottsdale and maybe we will try something else there next time. \n\nThey did have this great setup for kids with a waterballoon toss. Too fun! I am also a sucker for the race cars. It's on the to do list.
4	"""We've been here several times since it is right down the street from where the husband and I work. We've also brought the in-laws here, since they really like Pei Wei. I would have to say that this place is similar to Pei Wei, but with way more varieties and less of a \chain\"""" feel. \n\nWhen you dine here, you receive a salad with a tasty dressing and some wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce to start. Then you have many protein and vegetable options. When with the in-laws, we usually order way too much food, but it's all really tasty and makes good leftovers. The house fried rice is delicious - it comes with beef, chicken, and shrimp! The sweet and sour shrimp technically isn't on the menu, but they can bread anything and dunk it in sauce. S&S Shrimp is one of the father-in-law's favorite. The beef and broccoli is tasty - the broccoli tastes fresh and the beef is really tender. The sister-in-law and I really enjoy the beef teppanyaki - which is wide flour noodles with onions and beef. The sauce is delicious and again the beef is tender. The husband always orders a different dish, never deciding on just one favorite. On Saturdays, the lunch items are all $5, which is a great deal. If you are ever in the area, definitely give Flo's a try! You won't be disappointed."""""""
4	For those of you who want something delicious and authentic, I highly recommend you try out Shangri'La.  This place has been around as long as I have (ok, I am only 26, but still!).  For as old as it has been around, the quality still remains the same.  \n\nOn my last visit, I ordered the seared dumplings, sizzling soup, and some kind of sizzling peppered steak.\n\nThe soup arrived promptly.  Nothing better then hearing that spppplash of rice in the hot soup.  This soup needed no additional seasonings (with the exception of pepper, which I add to everything).  It was perfectly salted, perfectly heated, and filled with hearty vegetables and meats.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the shrimp in the soup.  It did not have any fishy taste to it what so ever.\n\nThe dumplings were equally as delicious.  They were fried to a nice consistency on each side and the accompanying sauce could be drank on its own.\n\nThe final treat was our steak meal.  I loved the fact that they provide you with a HUGE bowl of white rice on the side.  It definitely proved to leave plenty for our take out...which speaking of takeout, my fiance and I shared everything that night.  We ended up with an extra cup of soup, 2 extra dumplings, rice, and peppered steak.  Our meal came to around 25 for both of us, plus the remaining leftovers for the next day.\n\nIn either case, I recommend giving this place a try.  With age comes wisdom, and it is wise to go with what is known.
4	quick qualifier, I didn't choose to go here, the soccer team manager did...\nthe whole soccer team went between tournament games at Reach 11.\n\nOk - first know that at Culvers you're getting fairly greasy fast food type stuff \nlike burgers & fries.\n\nThey are known for their burgers & custard.  Didn't have either of those \nbut my sons gave the burgers a 3.5.  Fries were krinkle cut, very average.\n\nI had the Reuben, pretty good, but the sauerkraut was pretty bland. Probably \nthe healthiest sandwich on the menu besides the grilled chicken.\n\nUnlike McD's, they have competent people who work there.  \nAnd I like that they bring your order to your table, so you're not\nstumbling around waiting by the counter.\n\nSo definitely a step above all the big fast food chains with prices\nthat are just a tad (I think...) more.
5	This comfortable little cigar shop is hidden in a strip mall next to an off-track betting bar and a nail salon. The leather chairs are perfect for enjoying a smoke after rifling through the well-priced selections in the humidor. Mike, the owner, is incredibly friendly and doesn't mind if you want to pop in a movie (which they have quite a few choices readily available) on the flat-screen and eat your lunch while you kick back. \n\nKeep an ear open for when they have a customer appreciation day. The last one included free pizza, a cigar, scotch tasting, and a soda. Can't turn down a find like that!
4	Furio is just right in so many ways. White leather lounge sofas and the bold sexy decor set the mood and suggest an air of pretension, but the friendly service and basketball game on TV balance that with an air of a laidback sensibility.  The lounge area was neither too quiet nor too loud, neither too quiet nor too dark.  I'm diggin on you Furio!\n\nFancy martini and cocktail list are the name of the game here and prices are about average for the Old Town scene - think $10-12 martinis.  I opted for a Bacardi and Coke since all the cocktails sounded so sweet.  On a Thursday night with the Yelp crew there were about a dozen or so inside at about 10 pm when the dining area was shutting down.  \n\nI imagine this as somewhere to chill and gather to pre-party before heading out to the dance clubs. But I (and probably you too) would be just as fine relaxing the night away here. I would go here more often if it was closer to me, and I would be up for having dinner here sometime for sure. \n\nIt's actually more like 4.5 stars, but I'm reserving judgment until I dine there.
1	This place was so disappointing!  Everyone I know had such wonderful things to say about this place but my experience there was nothing short of disappointing.  We got there and from the front it looks like this cute, charming farm house but step inside and behind the wall where the three outside tables are and you have a huge room that lacks any luster.  Where to start on what went wrong...the server had zero personality and verged on rude, the salad was inedible (how can a salad be inedible?), entries took forever to come out and when they did there was nothing to it.  I ordered a baked chicken dish that was so not impressive.  Our side order of greens was overcooked and saturated in oil. And they only serve coffee by the pot not by the glass... who does that?   And to add insult to injury we had an enormous bill!  The upside... The bread was good.  Maybe they were having an off night or training a new chief but I would be reluctant to go back to this restaurant.
1	ahhh back in the day!!! when it was fresh and good, then fucking Fresh an Easy came along{ yes i do love me some f@E but damn}and they ruined it for all of us... \nNow it is like going back to an old boyfriend that you pretended was not that bad, righhhht... \nThey tried, really they did but it is just a shell, the magic is gone.. \nI've always been in love with you, i guess you know it's true, you took my love for granted.... why? the show is over say goodbye....SAY gooodbye....you broke my heart...
4	I really dig this place. From the outside you can't tell what this place has to offer. The decor/setting is great. It's neither a dress up or down sort of place, it's really what you want to make of it. \n\nThey have a great Bocci play area towards the back with an enclosed patio. And t.v's all around so you can catch a game or what have you.\n\nMy fave drink that the bartender turned me onto was a Moscow mule\nDrink Recipe Ingredients:\n\n    1.5 oz. Vodka \n    3 oz. ginger beer\n    1 teaspoon(s) sugar syrup\n    .25 oz. lime juice\n    1 sprig(s) mint\n    1 slice(s) lime(s)\n\nDefinitely check it out if you're looking for a 'lax evening with good company!
3	The place is beautiful inside and can seat and entertain plenty.  The beer selection is plentiful and there are TV's everywhere.  I could definitely see why hanging out here on a Sunday afternoon watching games is enticing... until you get hungry.  \n\nWe've been here with friends a few times and most recently on our own and each time I really wanted the food to be good enough to repeat but it's just not.  I realize it's pub fare, but there's not much flavor to any of it.  I'll take Cornish Pasty or Casey Moore's any day (note: it's been over a year since I've been to those places so if they suck now, sorry, I no longer live in EV).  \n\nThe service, however, is really friendly.  Bartender/Manager Brian has a great attitude and works hard.  The servers we've had are always friendly and even attentive on the patio.  \n\nI would for sure return here for starter cocktails or a night-cap or to catch a big game but I'll be sure to eat beforehand.
4	"""My NYE resolution was to stay away from fried foods. I tried, I really tried. That was until someone popped the question \What do you want from Sonic?\""""\n\nIt was a co-winkie-dink or maybe a sign from fate because I was looking at a Sonic coupon flyer (the ones you receive in the mail) and I was wondering what the burrito with the Frito's tasted like. Sign or no sign I was going to stick to my resolution. I responded, \""""Nothing, but thank you for asking.\""""\n\nAs Fate would have it, I received my utmost fave fried junk food in the WWW! A corndog. I scarfed that puppy down, chewed on the crunchy batter that is stuck to the stick in no time flat.\n\nI *heart* Sonic's corn dogs!\n\nPS - 2pm - 4pm it's happy hour! Drinks half off! Woo Hoo for the Cherry Lime-aide.\n\n4 stars because they have great customer service!"""""""
5	Splendid evening at Babaloos. Firstly, I'd like to thank Babaloos for the invitation, we had a really nice time. We've actually driven by a few times and were intrigued, but hadn't stopped in, that was a mistake! It's a very cute place, nice decor, the family seemed very nice, and well, let's get to the food, because it was absolutely scrumptious. \n\nWe arrived at 7:30ish, sat at a table and were immediately welcomed with a couple refreshing mojitos. A few minutes later Croquetas de Jamon were passed around by the servers. Trying to hide as mozzarella sticks this appetizer was much more delicate, filled with ham and a bechamel and served with a Mornay sauce. All of the tastings were paired with wine, and in this case it was a very nice chardonnay.\n\nThe second tasting was Amuse Bouche, a pineapple civiche, nice and crisp, paired with a pino grigio, which was perfect.\n\nMy favorite dish of the evening (other than the dessert, which, do not fear, I will get to) was the Camarones en Salsa Verde. Sauteed shrimp with salsa verde, which was light and fresh and wonderful, but my favorite part of the dish was the roasted tomato with tropical pesto, it was so flavorful! That was paired with a red, Montecillo Crianza, which I thought was strange, since the dish was so light, but surprisingly it worked really well together.\n\nNext was the Ropa Vieja, flank steak slow cooked for hours in red wine, tomatoes, garlic, peppers and onions served with black beans and rice. This was exactly what I wanted after the lighter dishes, substantial, well cooked and comforting.\n\nDrumroll please, the finally...TRES LECHES, dessert was amazing, I'm not exaggerating at all. My husband described it like a delicate cake served on rice pudding, but I think it was more like eating a sweet cloud at sunrise. We were pretty stuffed when the dessert arrived, but after one bite, it was impossible to stop. Seriously, must try. It was paired with an awesome aged rum, which I'm not usually a big rum drinker, but totally appreciated this one. \n\nI'm writing this review, the day after, and am already craving to go back.
4	"""\Just a spoonful of sugar, helps the pizza go down\""""\n\nI think that little ditty was the kitchen's motto when this place was Nello's, in Old Town...not any more:)\n\nI never really cared for Nello's all that much...just too sweet in the sauce department for my taste...not just the pizza, but pretty much everything they made that used red sauce of any kind.\n\nI'm happy to say that Jac bought this place last week, changed the name and threw away the bags of sugar that must have been littering the kitchen:)\n\nThe result is a very much improved, pizza centric, Italian dining experience:)\n\nThe Beautiful Carin and I met another couple for dinner at Jac's last evening...a double date...we're feeling social again:)\n\nNone of us knew that Nello's had changed hands...we went back and forth with texts to make sure that we were in the right spot...very entertaining:)\n\nBut once we were in, it was clear that things had changed...and for the better:)\n\nCarin and I each had a well made vodka martini...for $3.00 a pop...made with decent vodka, too!\n\nWe had appetizers...including a very well done bowl of mussels in a vodka sauce that was \""""lick the bowl\"""" good (although I didn't actually lick the bowl...much like when I was actually dating, Carin tells me that I should be on my best behavior when we are double dating...I don't know why...it's not like we're going home with them...but I was good:)\n\nThe new pizza menu at Jac's offers new and interesting artisan options, including the well done \""""Margherita\"""" and a \""""Bela Dela Meat\"""" something or other that was wonderful!\n\nThese pizza's were savory, well made, smokey from the wood oven and they were huge! :-)\n\nWe had two pizza's and ended up taking home almost  1/2 of each pizza:)\n\nA great value at under $80 US money for four of us, including multiple cocktails, two big pizza's and two appetizers:)\n\nFinally, while the d\u00e9cor hasn't changed, the atmosphere has...the cherry on top of the whipped cream was the delightful little jazz combo playing in the corner...at a level that gave us a great background music for our date, yet still let us carry on a conversation (Carin tells me that's a rule of dating...getting to know someone...so many dating rules...I thought I was done with all that...now I find that the rules are doubled for double dates:)\n\nIf you still need the sweet red sauce hit, ask them to bring the sugar bowl to the table...otherwise, drop by Jac's and enjoy the marti's and the pizza...oh, and get yourself a bowl of the mussel's...you can thank me when you see me:)"""""""
4	I love Cornish Pasty, I really do. I eat here regularly. I recommend full-tilt the lamb vindaloo, chicken tikka, royale with cheese, bangers and mash, the salmon one I forget what it's called--literally everything here is delicious. I need to try everything on the menu, it's a plethora of flavor delights. The crust on each pasty is amazingly flaky and buttery and makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The sauces are amazing. The food is last-meal-on-earth worthy.\n\nI cannot, however, give Cornish Pasty Co. five stars, because the service is sooo hit or miss. I will deal with slow service for the food, but good gravy I wish they'd get a clue on this point. Sometimes I go there and it's wonderful--I get my booze, food and check in a time frame reasonable for human living. Other times, I convince people I know to try the place out and we're literally there for two and a half hours while the one server working at the time roams the entire place and spends half the time chatting. \n\nI read a lot of yelp reviews of places I love and think people are being entitled jerks about the service and they should never leave corporate franchise places. I would never, never complain about service if it was even mediocre. Just, from time to time, the service here is so bad I do question whether I should ever go back.
4	I could eat the turkey subs here everyday if I could. One of the best subs I've ever had...and I eat them pretty frequently. The half sub is only 3.50, which is pretty cheap in my book. \nThis is family owned, so you always get greeted with a smile and a hello. Quick service.\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they only take cash, they close at 3 and are closed on Sundays and for weeks in the summer, which for me is a little troublesome..and the atmosphere is a little outdated. \nBut I gaurantee the food makes up for it!!
3	I would have given a four star rating, but today they didn't satisfy me as they always do when I normally work. Working in the mall i only have an option of food court or brave the lunchroom at work.\nOrdered a 2-entree, got the beef broccoli and orange chicken. Wait I should rephrase that. they were more like orange rocks. I wish they would make a new batch or scrape those out. Who wants to break their teeth on rocks. I could just see it now, greeting customers with chipped teeth. Everything else that i ordered was good.
4	First time at Zinburger; had a party of 4 on Friday; had to wait about 15 minutes; just what the hostess had said, I like that!!!  Now, the food; simple menu; but I got the speciality the Zinburger, but got mushrooms instead of grilled onion; delicious - it was cooked to perfection.  One of  my friends got the Samburger, he really seemed to enjoy it.  Another friend got the turkey burger; someone that has been to Zinburger before and told us what sides to order; devoured his turkey burger in no time flat.  Our other friend who only eats fish had the Ahi Sandwich; really enjoyed it.  The sweet potato fries & double truffle fries were awesome.  Also, split the banana creme pie between the 4 of us - YUMMY.  The service was great.  I will be back.
4	"""I work three hops from the Daily Dose so I had to try it as one of my first ventures out at lunch time.  We went a a little early which is critical if you are in a hurry as this place gets packed - the kitchen is fast but you might have a wait for a table.\n\nThe first time, DS met me as he had a job interview (sigh....baby boy is growing up!) and we brought a cubbie buddy from work.  \n\nDH and I both had the Southwest Club Wrap,  It was a nice portion although I asked for mine without the guac and found the sandwich to be a tad dry.  I think I would have liked it better with a little something else to moisten it a bit. I expected it to have a bit more kick with the peppered bacon but it didn't.  So although it was a well-stuffed wrap, it was just boring to me and him (he did have the guac).   He had the pile of combo fries which he deemed to be quite tasty and I had the very generous cup of fresh fruit which was a nice mix of melon and pineapple.\n\nCubby buddy ordered her fav from there - the eggs Benedict with turkey sausage.  It is the only thing she orders there so, of course, the next time I went, that was on my list.\n\nSo here is visit #2 - I had to take a  new employee to lunch and it was on the boss' tab so back we came and I had my sights on those eggs.  \n\nNow they are worth coming back for!  I like eggs Benedict. Actually, unlike Julia Roberts in \Runaway Bride\"""", I like eggs most any style but when you can take them and slather them with sauce well heck - they are just heavenly.  The Hollandaise is tasty - a little heavy handed but seriously that is what makes it so good.  And you will use that English muffin to sop up EVERY drop of it (before the days of YouTube, I would have licked that plate dry but you never know who is taping these days....). But what makes the eggs Benedict here is the turkey sausage.  I don't know whose they use - I am assuming they local source but maybe not - but it is just good. It is some of the best turkey sausage I have ever had - and I try it everywhere.  DH and I even buy our own spices and ground turkey and do our own in an attempt to make a really tasty sausage.  Whoever they use - it is good stuff - it is tasty like sausage but not overwhelmingly salty.  So now whenever I return to the DD, this is my go-to dish. Period.  It does come with the potatoes (meh - they are okay, nothing special) and I always opt for the fruit cup as it is fresh and a wonderfully sweet way to end a meal!"""""""
4	"""I used to be an In-N-Out fan but Five Guys is now my new favorite new fast food burger joint.  I think Five Guys gives you a good value for its price. The food is fresh and you can choose from a variety of toppings (from mushrooms to peppers) to add on your burger. Also, their fries are pretty good, though they are not as unique as In-N-Out's or McDonald's; I recommend ordering the seasoned ones.\n\nBe sure to tell them you want a \little\"""" hamburger or cheeseburger or they will give you a double patty burger."""""""
5	LOVE this place.  \n\nThe atmosphere and the decor  is classy and the vibe is decidedly sexy.  While on the smaller size in terms of space, it is far from cramped and uncomfortable.  I celebrated my birthday here with some girlfriends and we had a fantastic time.\n\nWhile I don't drink (not court or rehab mandated either) my friends raved about the Premarita Margarita, their signature drink made with Partida tequila and agave nectar.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the guacamole which is made tableside.  Since some of the ladies prefer their guac a bit spicier than the others, our server was happy to accomodate our requests.  I had the chicken tacos which were the perfect size for me.  I think that a man may look at the 3 small tacos on my plate and wonder what else was for dinner but for me it was perfect.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a delicious flavor that just spicy enough without searing my tastebuds off.  \n\nFor desert, my friend made me a home-made birthday cake that she brought in and for a small cake-cutting fee, was presented to me (with trick candles and sparklers no less!)  The service that we had was top notch.  Brian, the owner, made sure that we were taken care of and helped to make the evening special.  The bartender and server were both attentive, quick, and friendly.\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful birthday dinner.  I have never had a bad experience at The Mission and can't wait to return.
4	Stopped in for some Ranchera, went home with a bunch of fresh and cheap veggies, snacks, beers and sodas.\n\nThis is a really good representation of a valley carniceria; penche gringos may turn up their noses but valley g\u00fcero's who know what time it is will dig it. They had a fantastic looking seafood counter, everything looked super fresh and you can't smell even the slightest hint of fish in the air. The staff was very helpful to boot. This is likely your best option on this side of town.\n\nHeads-up on the address, though. It's actually 1708 W. Bell Road...there...that should keep you from crashing into the QT trying to find it.
1	"""So, I went to Over Easy once before and it was \ok\"""". Nothing great, they were super short handed, we got a free waffle because it took so long, the chicken fried steak and eggs were grissly but the gravy was good. But, I decided to give it another try. Huge mistake. We get there and the same staff problem..2 servers for the small, but very busy restaurant. My 2 friends each got the same thing, the Wolfpack. It was supposed to be eggs and chz layered between hashbrowns. I got the sirloin steak and eggs with carmalized onions. Their breakfast came out with sliced half cooked country potatoes-apparently they were out of hash browns?! How is that possible...they only serve breakfast and it was 10:30am. Mine came, it wasn't what I ordered. Fine, honest mistake, not a big deal...they went to remake it. Our server never once came over, not once, to apologize or to check to see if the food that did come was ok, which it wasn't. My breakfast came after my friends were done with what they could eat...This is the worst part. It was a plate of watery liuid gravy, grissly meat that looked like dog food, and the eggs were gooey. I took three bites of the eggs, I was starving, and couldnt eat anymore. Horrible. All three of us were still hungry when we left and frustrated as heck. They comped my breakfast... but not a chance Ill go back. I'd rather have Denny's or IHOP any day. I really think a lot of these crazy 4 and 5 star reviews are employees... no way this place was capable of 5 stars."""""""
5	I'm sitting here thinking about all the wonderful things that Jan and Helen make at Sweet Republic. They both work so hard to make sure that everyone who visits has a great experience at their store.. the last time I visited I had a frozen yogurt (gotta watch my bearish figure) and it was the smoothest, creamiest and tastiest frozen yogurt Ive had. Even after visiting Pinkberry a few weeks back I realized just how much better their product is. I know that when they make any of their tasty creations its honest to goodness.
3	I had a two hour layover in this airport so I had some time to explore.  I would have to say this isn't the best airport in the world, but it is not the worst.  It is definitely better than having to wait in the Vegas airport.  \n\nThe food choices are pretty meager in this place.  Nothing really stood out.  Wendys, Pizza Hut, TBCY, Starbucks and a couple of sit down places were what really stood out.  The bathrooms were at least clean though.
3	Grimaldi's as a whole is 5 STARS but this location is a 3. We waited forever for this location to open, when It finally did we were excited to go.  We went on a weeknight and didn't have to wait long but were taken to a dark corner over by the bar. Our waiter didn't talk to us for like 10 minutes and the people at the bar were S faced and grabbing people.  This place is cramped. The design is terrible. Its a U shaped layout with the kitchen in the middle. Even though this new location is like 2 minutes from my house we will make the trek to the Alma School/Queen Creek location. And I recommend the same.
4	Anyone who knows me knows how serious I take my BBQ. The problem with living in the far east valley is the lack of quality restaurants near by. Even with a dry cleaner, among other small mom and pop shops near by this place does a good job of drawing you in with the smoky and sweet smell of slow cooked meat. This is not your backyard grilled meats masquerading as BBQ after hiding under a overdose of super sweet sauce. No! this is meat the way it was meant to be cooked. Big hunks of meat cooked low and slow transforming into tender and juicy meat so good tasting you will wish you had three stomachs.\n\nLOL sorry kind of wandered off there for a minute but I'm back now. \n\nAnyways the place is set up very simply with small yet well spaced out tables each offering one of three kinds of sauce (sweet, mild, and I believe a hot version. Now I like sauce but had to say I was not a big fan of these. The owner seemed to have added Italian salad dressing to them as a way to add extra flavor. \n\nIn the past I have heard of others doing this but in this case it did nothing but add a weird after taste to the sauce. The hot version had a good kick but again had the same after taste issue. I recommend just forgoing their sauce altogether and just using one you have at home. Anyways moving on to the main attraction which is the meat. Others who have reviewed this place said it had a great smoky flavor and My texas brisket sandwich did not disappoint. \n\nThe meat was tender, had a good outside bark and smoke ring letting me know the person cooking this food knew what they were doing. As this was my first time here I just stuck to the meat (no sides this trip) but my friend has and thought the cole slaw was ok but was kind of watery. If you have a sweet tooth they also offer sweet treats like pecan pie and cookies. Overall I have to say the food I had was good and I do look forward to trying other menu items in the future. The prices may keep some people away but while you are going to pay more than you would for one of those fake BBQ Mc rib sandwiches I say it is more than worth it. Don't believe me then try it for yourself.
3	I'm so torn.  This place could be really good, and parts of it were.  I did enjoy their samples, and it definitely told me what was good and what was not.  Their system of ordering and the options you can choose are awesome.  \n\nThe jerk chicken rice and the black beans were the best part of the meal.  I didn't care for the red jade chicken.  It was just greasy sweet and sour chicken.  Takeout status.  I did enjoy the carnitas burrito, but why would I order that here if I can just go some real Mexican place anywhere else?  \n\nOh, your meal also comes with a cookie.  Snickerdoodle, to be precise.
5	This review is purely for the Banana Cream Pie.....as I am from Australia I had never had Banana Cream Pie....so my husband ( who had a major craving for one)...phoned around some restaurants to find where they served them....The White Chocolate Grill delivered!...It was awesome and made on site. Our waiter was very friendly and didn't mind that we were taking up a table in a very full restaurant just to share a piece of pie. The atmosphere was very nice too and next time we will go before we eat dinner and order a little more! The menu looks very good.
5	"""Smeeks, Smeeks, Smeeks, oh how I adore thee!  Trinkets, toys, candies, lollies and tiny Germanic gnomes!  I am in sheeeeer heaven here!  When something bad happens to me and I have to retreat to my \happy place\"""" -- Smeeks is where I go in my head.  \n\nSmeeks is the brilliant brain child/offshoot of neighboring Frances Boutique and boasts the best selection of vintage candies, baubles and retro childhood memories.  Over the past 2 months I've admittedly dropped almost 3 Benjamins in this place, because I simply cannot get enough!  Smeeks fueled my holiday shopping for my nieces, me mum and my employees.  I even indulged myself and invested in the most adorable red resin gnome piggybank (that was $50 bucks rite there, but I had to have him!!).\n\nSmeeks has sourced the most excellent assortment of vintage candies & sweets, funky. fun & retro toys & games, kooky Japanese collectibles and they wrap it all up in the most adorable red/white/turquoise finery known to man.  I like to go in and peruse all the cool toys on the wall. I've gotten a package of wax paper drinking straws (total throwback to my childhood).  I've taken fun photos with a friend in their retro black & white 4-spot photobooth.  I've found candies, sweets & gum I haven't seen since i was a kid, like:\n- CHARMS Assorted Squares\n- Chowards Violet candies\n- NECCO wafers\n- Cherry Mash\n- Pop Rocks\n- Wonka Bars\n- Wax bottles\n- Candy cigarettes\n- Double Bubble gum\n- Scads more...\nAnd they have their own brand of packaged deliciousness!  I highly recommend the gummy strawberries and chocolate covered cookie dough!  They have the MOST amazing kettle corn (almost tastes like Pops cereal -- no husks/kernals, super light and golden yellow, fresh beyond comparison)!\n\nMy fave newest find are these tiny delicious Italian licorice rounds (kinda of like Sen Sen), called CHIPS.  They're $0.05/piece or you can fill a tiny Chinese takeout container for $3.00.  That's the way to go!\n\nThe staff is uber-helpful and friendly. They will gift wrap your goodies for you, or as i did over the holidays (when it was busy and there was a line at the register), they hooked me up with all the fixin's so I could make my own goodie bags & boxes at home.  They gave me scads of ribbon, adorable printed bags & takeout containers, and lots of fun stickers with the Smeeks logo with the shy little gnome.  It was so fun buying a basket full of candy & goodies and making up my gifts at home for a personal touch.\n\nIf you're having a bad day, or simply want a fun diversion on a Sunday afternoon, stop in and escape to that happy place of your childhood with Smeeks boutique!"""""""
5	"""I have been wanting to go to the Phoenix Art Museum for a long time now.  I just kept showing up on days they were closed or days when they didn't open until much later than I got there!  \n\nThey're closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and their hours are longer on Wednesdays.  Also, on Wednesdays, entry is free for everyone from 3P-9P; they just ask for a donation.  Kids under 6 are always free!\n\nLuckily, I was able to make it in today with my daughter.  \n\nThere is a current Paper exhibit that is pretty cool.  There is a papier mache sculpture exhibit by a Tucson artist that is veryyyyyy spooky.  There are dresses made from newspaper and the yellow pages.  There are lithographs of pop art you may recognize.  \n\nI liked that the museum houses a good balance of fine art and modern art.  I am not too keen on pop art, but DD is.  Her favorite piece in the whole museum was \The Artist who Swallowed the World,\"""" by Erwin Wurm.  She couldn't stop talking about it and remembered it by name.  She made sure to ask me what each piece was named, though sometimes she would dart to the next piece before hearing the answer.\n\nMy favorites were mostly in the fine art area.  I especially loved looking at all the old portraits.  Sometimes I felt as if they were alive.  If only the movie Night at The Museum was nonfiction!  But, seriously, the old masters really had a gift for painting their subject's gaze.  Fascinating!\n\nI also loved seeing the old bathing suits from the 20s and 50s and the old Naval uniforms.  I would LOVE to have a vintage bathing suit.  In fact, I might scour Etsy for one now!\n\nWe both loved the museum, even though I would have preferred to spend more time there.  DD was seeking quantity over quality today.  Perhaps I will get the chance to meander here another time with another adult!"""""""
5	SUGAR COMA! I should have learned to pace myself after last year's sugar coma, but when I'm in a room full of cupcakes, I just can't help myself. This year was no difference. As VIPs, we were given a super cute gift bag filled with countless goodies, as well as early cupcake access, cocktails, and apps. Oh, the cupcakes... A few of the bakers I have reviewed were here (see my list OMG CUPCAKES!) so it was nice to be able to try some of their other flavors. (Urban Cookies had their awesome German Chocolate Cupcakes, The Sweet Tooth Fairy had a delicious variety (I tried the Sweet Potato Cupcake), and GiGi's was in attendance (I wasn't able to try theirs).) Other vendors included: TLC Bakery (yummy Pecan Pie Cupcake), Whoopie Baking Co (Chocolate Whoopie!), Mind Over Batter (my new favorite - the Dark Helmet!) and many, many more. I love being able to try and discover new cupcake vendors, especially for a good cause! 100% profit was given to a Veterans Charity this year, which is fantastic. Other awesome features were the photo booth (major props to Snapbooth - they are awesome!) as well as a cupcake decorating station, button making for the kiddies, and raffle prizes. Can't wait for next year!
4	"""Woo braddah! What a place to find myself while I'm here all week for business! From the cloth chihuly umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, pages of menu to some pretty original pacific fusion. \nFirst night here had the volcano and the lobster and ahi flat bread. That was it, sushi pizza, even in Hawaii, never had this combo done right. Seared tombo, langoustine usugiri avocado and tomatoes drizzles with yuzu aioli, piled on top of a fresh baked crispy flatbread... My mouth is broken, I can barely speak. Delicious. The Waitress was very friendly, she brought me a special sauce that she likes on the pizza, a spicy aioli. She might as well given me a bottle of \give me a giant tip\"""" brainwash juice. \nLove it. I'm planning to come back for one more taste... If it's good as it just was, I'm gonna have to give it that last star."""""""
5	A little hard to find and the exterior may throw you off but you would be making a HUGE mistake to not enter one of the best soul food gems in AZ. The staff is more amazing than the food and that is not an insult to the food but as a restaurant mangers view just as important. Friendly- funny- upbeat. Go early or you may have to wait outside. The word is out and its a 4 star place I will go back to.
1	You'll Be Disappointed\n\nVery attractive restaurant belies terrible service and worse food preparation and presentation.  My advice -- stay away, there are lots better places in Scottsdale and environs.\n\nWaiter started out by lauding the size of various salads, entrees, etc.  Touted as very splitable. We split the prawn risotto. A dollop of risotto, covered by 2 prawns each.  That 4th prawn was an extra charge.\n\nFriends split the lasagne.  We all know what a slice of lasagne should look like.  The split portions were served in a cup the size of a small custard cup.  But each had a slice of bread attached to this sumptuous presentation!  The restaurant should have been embarrassed to have brought such a joke to the table.  \n\nA third friend sent her seared tuna entree back twice.  It was served ice cold each time. They gave up and just took it off the bill.\n\nThe days of free dessert to atone for bad food and service are long gone.  This place is a culinary joke.  Don't waster your time and money.  You'll be disappointed.
4	This place has a great atmosphere. The patio is awesome and they place live music. The food was delicious and they had tons of healthy options. So why not 5 stars? The service was pretty bad. I ordered wine and asked for water with it. Then I asked again, and again. But it never came. I also ordered my meal with no tomatoes and they put them on. My friend ordered her sandwich with no mayo and they put it on too. So just plan to be there a while and don't be too picky and you'll love it!
2	"""If you were a member of Pure Fitness before LA took over you might relate to this. Have you seen the movie \Dodgeball\"""" with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn? Well, Pure Fitness was Average Joes, nice people, regular hard working folks trying to better themselves with the help of nice employees genuinely concerned about helping customers out. LA Fitness is GlobalGym. Lots of meatheads working there, collecting paychecks and spending their money on their retarded \""""fauxhawk\"""" hair-doos. They would rather spend time in their cubicles playing solitaire than walk around, visit, and answer questions. People are not friendly, the equipment is lopsided (really, 5 different types of ab-machines but only one lat pull down and one lat row machine)?? Corporate money collecting dues and laughing to the bank. The pool water is always cloudy, the place is undersized to accommodate the new customer base, and it just isn't a welcoming place. I really miss Pure Fitness."""""""
5	I booked our anniversary trip to the Westin Kierland through Priceline.  It was so reasonably priced that I was a bit concerned it would lack quality, and after reading a few reviews on Trip Advisor I was worried.  I was COMPLETELY wrong.  This is a 5 star resort from the moment you park your car.  The front desk staff upgraded our room, and this very nice gentleman greeted us with a smile every single time we passed through the lobby.  They have golf carts available to drive you to your rental car.  The food in Deseo is amazing.  I would definitely recommend trying the ceviche sampler and the muddled cocktails.  I can't forget to mention the amazing bread made with tapioca flour, they will even give you the recipe. \n\nWe especially enjoyed talking to the girls in the information center (the one that looks like a mine).  They were VERY helpful in giving us advice on local restaurants and insisting we take a day trip to Sedona......we did and Sedona is now one of our favorite cities. Thanks to Ashley, Miranda, Tiffany, Chelsea, and Pat.  When we returned from our Sedona day trip, we had chips & salsa, and two cold coronas.  This was a very thoughtful touch.\n\nIf you are looking for a fine dining experience, Mastros Ocean Club is right across the street and has incredible food.  I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes and the seared scallops.  \n\nBack to the resort.......our room had a great view of the golf course which was massive.  Although we are not golfers, we certainly enjoyed the view.  Our room was a pretty good size and the Heavenly Beds are my absolute favorite.  When traveling I will do my very best to ensure we stay at a Westin Resort.
3	Arrowhead is a good average mall. It has everything you would expect from a typical mall and it is clean. The food court is ok, it could be better. \n\nThe only problem that I have with Arrowhead is that it's lacking variety and pizzazz. My boyfriend pointed out that it doesn't have a lot of places for guys besides your typical Foot Locker, Dick's, and Macy's etc... \n\nIf looking for your basics and no frills malls give Arrowhead a try but if  you're wanting more then try Arizona Mills or Scottsdale Mall.
5	Now here is a way to earn an extra star for excellent customer service in my book! Recently, I was in the mood for a beach vacation and unfortunately, Hawaii was a little too far away so I opted for Tommy Bahamas instead. Second best right? When I sat down, I ordered a nice Bahama Mama Hurricane and jokingly asked for a side of beach to go with it as she was walking away. Moments later, she returned with my drink and a side of beach! Literally...she brought a plate with sand, two shells and an umbrella! Tommy Bahama should give this waitress a raise for having such good customer service skills that she goes out of her way to think of something like creating a makeshift beach for a customer!
4	I was in Glendale briefly and my friend who lives there took me here for some good ol' Asian food. It was a great pick since I hadn't been eating anything substantial all day. I only managed to get one dish, of course, but would be willing to try out more if I go back!\n\nThose of you familiar with Com Tam entrees will know what this common restaurant dish is that I ordered. It was charbroiled pork with egg cake, pickled vegetables, broken Jasmine rice, and shredded pork. This also came with a bowl of Vietnamese fish sauce which I prompted doused my rice in because I love broken rice mixed with that sauce. The pork itself was delectable though a little tough to cut. They had sliced it up into attached strips, however, so that was easier than having to cut it all up myself. The vegetables were great but not as crisp as I would've liked. My complaint with the dish was the egg cake, which was too hard and condensed. It made me wonder if it had been sitting around for a little bit because of its texture. I only managed two bites of it before I called it quits. As for my drink, I had a Thai tea that I had asked for without boba but the waiter still put it in there...and it wasn't great at all. The Thai tea itself was delicious but the boba was disgusting. I avoided it by drinking from the top. My friends ordered pho so if I ever went back there again, I think I'd try that next.
4	"""So this place re-opens under new management as the all-new Wet'n'Wild water park in a week or two.  Sounds awesome if you look at their website and interactive map and a preview of all the thrill rides.  The landscaping looks to be much better too.  It's about time the hottest, fastest-growing and fifth largest city in the nation had an A-List theme park when SoCal has about ten alone!  When I see the Travel Chanel's \Top Ten U.S. Water Parks\"""" they blow all of ours away.  I hope they re-engineer the wave pool with rolling waves, so that you can ride them like at Big Surf, instead of the intermittent \""""undulation\"""" it had here before and at Golfland Sunsplash in Mesa.\n\nAlthough it wasn't opened its first year by June, it will run all the way until the end of October and season passes are discounted at $59.99 before opening day.

5	my first-ever experience at one of roy yamaguchi's restaurants was on my tiny little island in the middle of the pacific ocean. poipu, kauai, hawaii to be exact. and since my fist experience, roy's restaurants never fail to amaze me.\n\nthis was a special occasion because it happened to be my birthday!! my husband and i decided to do something special and spend the weekend away from tucson and drive up to the phoenix area. i was excited to find a local favorite of mine from back home up here on the mainland. \n\ni made my special birthday dinner reservation and was even excited that they answered the phone with a friendly 'aloha'.\n\nas expected, we were seated at a nice, intimate table. the one thing i love about roy's is how personalized he makes your experience. because they knew i was coming in for my birthday dinner, they made a nice little insert for the menus brought to our table. when we were done ordering, they rolled the inserts up and gave them to us to have as keepsakes. \n\nour server was gracious and kind the entire evening. \nthe husband had a combination of two types of seafood -- fish and scallops (that were hugeeeee!!) and i got the filet mignon. everything was cooked to perfection. of course we had to get the chocolate souffl\u00e9 for desert. you can't ever go to roy's and not get chocolate souffl\u00e9. it should be against the law. it has to be the best desert on the face of the earth [in my humble opinion]. to top that off, they even brought out their signature flourless chocolate complete with candle and our server took our picture and framed it to also take home.\n\nwe both left fat & happy. if i could have it my way, i'd choose roy's restaurant for every special occasion we celebrate because the people that work for roy always go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect. \n\nmahalo nui loa a hui hou, roy's chandler! hope to see you soon!
1	Very negative feeling about this place. I heard an advertisement on the radio for $.40 wings on Tuesday's and a couple weeks later went in to try the place out. Unfortunately they stopped the promotion because it wasn't popular enough. There was no recovery to at least offer me the deal since that was why we came in the first place which really set me the wrong way. \n\nThe server was kind enough to offer we go to Native New Yorker instead, great advice that I'm sure will keep me coming back. Just a very weird scenario all together.
2	i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza. i hate the sweet sauce, i hate that the ingredients are under the cheese so they don't get crunchy and crispy, the pepperoni is floppy. just not for me. the crust was kinda gooey like. \n\nmy delivery was 30 minutes late but its ok bc i wasn't in a hurry. they were really nice i just can't stand this kind of pizza. \n\n\nif you like the sweet sauce and toppings under the cheese then go for it bc you'll probably love it!
4	"""My first time at Buster's - a wedding. The wedding party reserved the patio near the lake, which was nice. A little small, but we were celebrating and enjoyed the company, cool weather (great breezes that evening), and excellent food. I had the filet mignon and it was delicious- cooked to perfection and served with garlic mashed potatoes, with sauteed green beans. I finished every bit of it! Our server was amazing, attentive to empty glasses, friendly with nice words for the bride & groom, and respectful to each person's requests/needs. \n\nFrom what I can tell, this is an establishment that has been around a while. The decor is \classic\"""" with B&W photographs of vintage/timeless Hollywood stars and athletes. I'm not sure of pricing but would guess this is probably a $20+ per plate type restaurant. If the weather permits I would suggest requesting a seat outdoors on their patio- it's great."""""""
3	You will have a hard time convicing me that any tex-mex restaurant in the valley is as good as some of our best authentic mexican cuisine, so Chevy's starts a leg down in my estimation. \n\nIt's not bad, and the homemade tortillas are actually somewhat impressive. Still, I would advise exhausting all other mexican options first, then, in the tex-mex pecking order, going to Ajo Al's, or if that doesn't work, try Chevy's. \n\nIt is a good place to take a large group and drink margaritas and celebrate and non-romantic event, such as a birthday or graduation. Celebrants are given a large sombrero, which, invariably, they will wear for the duration of the night out after sipping on a little too much tequila. \n\nDon't believe me? You'll see.
2	"""Overpriced and underimpressed!\n\nWhile the wait staff is friendly, courteous and very efficient, the food sucks.  I paid over $10 for a \shrimp\"""" salad that was 1 head of dressed butterleaf lettuce, 10 croutons, a few sliced cherry tomatoes and 8 shrimps - NOT marinated as promised.  A joke of a salad.\n\nEvery time we visit this establishment (per the behest of visiting parents) I'm less and less impressed.\n\nNext time the folks are in town, we'll be seeking out a different restaurant."""""""
4	"""Now, a somewhat dinner review.\n\nMy out of town visitor said she wanted a place like Buffalo Wild Wings, but better. And she wanted beer. I said...ok. Culinary Dropout it is.\n\nLast night, we were promptly seated, ordered our beverages, and then got the pretzels and cheese fondue. Absolutely amazing. As always. It was my day off from the gym, so I said...\What the hell!\""""\n\nInstead of ordering entrees, we decided to order a place of prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes, and some manchego cheese, served with crostinis.\n\nEverything was flavorful. The sun dried tomatoes were perfectly marinated, the manchego was at just the right temperature, and the prosciutto was finely sliced like a delicate piece of angel paper. What the hell is angel paper? I have no idea. I am just free-writing. Go with it.\n\nBottom line, you will never go wrong here. Appetizers, Entrees, Charcuterie....anything. This is your spot. \n\nService is a tad spotty in the evening, but I suppose that CAN be a good thing if you are in a good conversation."""""""
5	WOW...another GREAT meal at Girmaldi's\nWe tend to end up here at least once a month when the craving for pizza is upon us.  Marla (manager) ALWAYS goes above and WAY beyond to make sure our visit will keep us coming back.  This trip was no different than every other one...!  The pizza is GREAT and they always get it 'right'.  \nSo the next time the pizza crave hits you....head to The Quarter to Grimaldi's and tell them Van sent you...See Marla and give her a GREAT BIG hug from me!\nProp's to Lucas for joining the management team headed by Brad!!!
3	While Chicago-style dogs are more my flavor... I had to give Nogales a fair chance. I mean... what ISN'T appetizing about eating cheap Mexican weiners sold on dirty Phoenix parking lot?!\n\nThe stand is set up on the corner of  SW corner of 19th st and Indian School in front of a guitar store, so it was easy to find. I think by 6 pm is when the owner and his wife start setting up.\n\nBeing that it was my first time, they were very nice when I asked them how I should eat it. This bacon-wrapped, slim hotdog could be topped with anything, onions, beans, mayonnaise, green avocado (i think) dip, salsa... it was dark out so I couldn't really see what I was putting on my hotdog, all I know was that it was getting very heavy and soggy by now.\n\nAt first bite, it was exactly what I thought it would be... a bacon-wrapped hot dog with onions, beans, etc. Nothing extraordinary.\n\nIt was definitely refreshing washing it down with a Mexican coke though. I finished my hot dog fairly quick and felt like I wanted another but resisted the temptation. \n\nSo for less than $5 you can get yourself a Nogales hotdog with a Mexican coke but at least you can tell everyone that you ate Mexican wieners on dirty corner somewhere in Phoenix.
3	Made a recent trip to Nello's Pizza while at work.  The place has a nice atmosphere, with comfortable seating.  We were helped as soon as we walked up to the to go counter.  The gentleman who took our order was extremely friendly (as were the rest of the employees).  Prices were reasonable, I think we paid somewhere around $11 for a large pizza.  The gentleman who took our order told us it would be about ten minutes (it ended up taking 20). \n\nI must say I wasn't terribly impressed with the pizza.  It was pretty good, but Nello's pizza didn't really distinguish itself from any of the hundreds of other pizza places in the Valley.  In my opinion the crust was mediocre, and there was WAY too much sauce. \n\nPROS: \nReasonable prices\nComfortable atmosphere\nFamily owned local business\n\nCONS: \nToo much sauce\nCrust is just okay\nTook longer than expected to get our food\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nI'd eat at Nello's again if I were in the area, but there are certainly better choices for pizza in the Valley.
3	My order:  shrimp & chicken, extra spicy.  I didn't, no, couldn't eat any of it.  Way too spicy.  Oh well, I was full from the sampler anyway.\n\nHis order:  fire steak.  Tasted great, but no 'fire' - mashed potatoes were awesome too.\n\nAppetizer:  sampler.  $17 but well worth it - you probably can share an entree if you get this appetizer.  It's delicious!  The pretzel combo was so unique!\n\nI don't know if we'd go back here (if we lived in AZ, or even try visiting the one in LB, CA), but glad we tried it out.  Wish we could've tried the brew.  Service was alright, but could definitely have been better.
5	This location of Buffalo Exchange is amazing.\n\n I usually start by satisfying my denim addiction and peruse through the jeans. They have all the top designer brands (True Religion, Rock & Republic, William Rast, Seven) found for over two hundred dollars at Nordstom. After I finish it's straight to the fitting rooms because there's no way I could carry around 40 pounds of jeans very long. Sometimes the staff will ask if you'd like to start a little collection back there while you look.. tricky little buggers. \n\nThe prices are great and the condition of the clothing is always pretty good to excellent. I can't think of any times I didn't get a friendly hello on my way in the door. \n\nI've had quite the good luck in selling items to this location also, which is great considering I go in expecting them to not take anything.
4	The only reason that Oregano's did not get 5 stars from me is because they are pretty slow. I am not sure if it takes longer for them to make my pizza, but it usually take about 45 minutes for you food to come out. Also, they are generally pretty busy. However, worth the wait. The pizza I get is a thin crust with bacon, spicy sausage, pepperoni, and the spicy feta cheese. I love this combination. I really want to branch out and try others, but at the same time it is always a winner. \n\nTheir fried potato appetizer is also pretty good. Which, is simply just criss-cut fries. I recommend this place. A while back I had a friend visiting and we were talking about things that he wanted to do and he mentioned that the last time he was in Arizona he went o this really good pizza place. That place is Oregano's. \n\nI have been to the Tempe location as well. However, I did not get to eat there since it was over an hour wait and I was starving. ( side not= the Tempe location is really really really small)
5	I can now say I have reached the pinnacle of pizza perfection.\n\nPizza has always been one of my favorite foods and has recently become one of my obsessions after visiting Naples this summer. I have found some amazing people within the states most notably in the Bay Area, Southern California and Chicago, but was simply blown away by the perfection that is Pizzeria Bianco.\n\nI came here on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait for a table of five. We sat down and were super excited to sample some of the best pizza in America.\n\nI started off with a salad consisting of fresh mozzarella, basil, olive oil and tomatoes. It is probably impossible to make that list of ingredients taste bad and this salad did not disappoint. Everything worked perfectly together. The salad was light, so fresh and so damn good.\n\nI had to order the margherita pizza because that's the best way to judge a place I feel. The pizza came out piping hot and it was absolutely beautiful. The crust was for sure a clear highlight. It had a beautiful char and a great chew to it. The combination of sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil made this easily one of the best pizzas I have ever had. So amazing.\n\nI also tried a few slices of the Rosa pizza and that thing blew me away. The combination of onions, paremesan reggiano and arizona pistachios was a flavor I had never experienced. The pizza was rich and so ridiculously flavorful. It was one of the best specialty pizzas I have ever had.\n\nI came into Pizzeria Bianco with insanely high expectations and I believe the restaurant exceeded them. The ingredients are what really set this place apart from everyone else and the pizza is simply amazing. Bianco sets the standard for Neapolitan pizza in the United States and I am not sure there is another place that could beat it....
2	Dark, mysterious and sultry inside and out, but lacks that passion, that soul, that oomph.  Wanna be upscale, but you can't dress up a boring personality.  Ultimately just your cookie cutter chain restaurant.  \n\nBeautiful decor, menu is just bland and limited compared to the variety you'd get a CAKE or Yardhouse.  Southwestern egg roll appetizers were nothing special (can't beat CAKE avocado egg rolls). Had a unmemorable french dip.  Really wanted some mashed potatoes w/ some gravy, but their special gravy is basically just like a runny au jus.\n\nService was decent, but sadly can't make up for the unexciting grub.  \n\nEat here if: You like driving a Prius around a racetrack.
5	"""Short Leash Dogs is amazing, for sure.\n\nThe owners could not be sweeter and more friendly, and that is the secret to their success. In addition to buying an amazing product at good value, you get to meet and become part of the extended family with Short Leash. Even on the busiest of days, the SLD crew has time to say hi, chat, and make you feel like you're a good friend visiting their home. On a recent order I messed up what I typically get, and Brad stopped me and asked, \Hey- you usually get a beer hot, do you want something different?\"""" Nope- I just spaced it, and he caught it.\n\nThe food is as amazing as the service, and I highly recommend getting a corn pup (with mustard, NEVER ketchup) and an Aiko dog with beer hot, or as I am trying to get it renamed, the Baiko!\n\nDo yourself a favor, and DO NOT miss this amazing little food truck. Every visit I make you will see that Short Leash Dogs is the busiest and most popular, and that is for a good reason. Don't stress if there is a line, the SLD crew does not screw around- and the food is more than worth it.\n\nKeep up the amazing work guys, I hope someday you guys have a brick and mortar location- because I will be the first one in line."""""""
2	SO I have eaten in here, as well as gotten delivery. When we dine in, the passion bread is a nice complimentary touch, pizza is pretty good, and wings are yummy too. However, something bad happens between the restaurant and delivery. My boyfriend and I hypothesize it has something to do with the fact that they bake their wings, but upon arrival (earlier than predicted even!) the wings/boneless wings are mushy and vinegary...bummer. We ordered delivery out of necessity since it was a Sunday night football kind of day (drinking), and we were a little disappointed. Oh well...make up your mind for yourself.
4	First day in Arizona.. 1 hr after checking in our hotel at Wild Horse Pass hotel and casino.. we decided to try out this asian spot. it was pretty good.. but not as good as the asian spots in Cali where most asians lived. the food was a bit too salty. the lemonade drink thing i got was too bitter. wished it was a bit sweeter. my bestie and i ordered the Pad Thai and Filet mignon dish.. both were a bit salty. the Pad thai was drowning in msg and sauce. it was a bit too much for me =/\n\nService was great tho!!! the asian man who was our waiter was very attentive and hooked us up. \n\nnext time i wanna try their Sliders. the burgers looked HUGE O_O
4	After a long day in the sun it was time to cool off and grab some lunch.  I went to Tradiciones and am very glad I did.  The food was amazing.  I had the pollo en mole and it was very good spicy yet sweet.  After dinner I had the tres leches cake which was also very yummy.  To wash all this down I had the millionaires margarita and it was very potent.  It had grand marnier, tequila, and Chambord.  Overall the meal was great and I will keep this on my list of favorite mexican places to eat in Arizona.
4	R took me here for a belated Valentine's dinner. Thought it was nice without being pretentious or too fancy. Started with the duck confit, which I thought was nice but nothing too special. R had the Alsacian tart (warm brie and fruit baked in a phyllo), but since he doesn't like to share his food I only got 2 bites. But 2 very nice bites. \n\nMains: R had the rib-eye filet. Tender, but not fatty enough for me. I *heart* well marbled meat. I ordered the scallops with risotto. 6 seared scallops that were sweet and salty like the sea :-) \n\nDessert: chocolate bread pudding. It was actually very bread-y, like  a bread-y cake. \n\nYou can order wine by the half-glass which is very convenient when you want to pair the courses with wine. \n\nThe damage: way more exensive than I expected. We could have gone to Maestros or Roaring Fork for the same price.
5	This show was fantastic. I highly recommend it to everyone. It was act after act of pure enjoyment. The price of the ticket was a huge value for what we saw. If you are going to see the show, this is defiantly one you don't want to go cheap on the tickets.\n\nI didn't follow the whole storyline but I really wasn't there for the story. I wanted to see the acts that the performers did. Wow! Was it worth it. Just when you thought an act couldn't be topped, another performance outdid the previous one.\n\nThe clowns that did perform between the acts were pretty funny and did keep you laughing throughout the show.\n\nI saw Mystere in Las Vegas and felt that this was better. \n\nDon't miss this opportunity to see it while they are here.
3	My friend and I love to try new restaurants. We saw this one on food network and decided to try. The first thing I ordered was a margarita...THEY HAVE NO ALCOHOL. We order drinks with every dinner so no alcohol is kind of a big deal. Other than that we ordered and split the del ray then ordered a quesadilla to go. The Del Ray was fantastic and the Bistec quesadilla was the best quesadilla I've ever had. I would definitely go back for the food.... but come on guys...lets get a liquor license!
5	"""Wow. I'm embarassed I didn't know about this place earlier. And I call myself a Phoenician?\n\nI came here for dinner last night after reading the review by Sabrina, who ought to be awarded the Nobel Prize for something for discovering this place. I almost don't want to write this review because it'll spoil the surprises you're in store for when you visit. \n\nIt begins when you pull into the parking lot and eye the shady looking exterior, but then step inside. The owner has gone to great lengths to decorate with a unique theme of Mexican life on the sea. I was charmed the instant I opened the door. \n\nThe menu is your next surprise. Not one item on the first three pages is anything you've ordered before at any other Mexican restaurant. The dishes are all seafood based, including crab, octopus, and lots of shrimp. What says it all is the description on the last page of the menu that offers \Mexican food\"""", where you can get the standard fare of cheese enchiladas etc. \n\nWhat I say next I do not say lightly. As of right now, this place serves THE BEST, #1, salsa in the state of Arizona. This is based on a lifetime growing up in this state and sampling salsas hundreds upon hundreds of times at our best Mexican restaurants from Ajo to Tucson to Springerville. When my dinner companion told the owner how much she liked the salsa he remarked to us that it was a new recipe. There are actually two salsas that come with the chips, one a reddish green variety and the other being avocado-based. The avocado based one is also excellent, but it's the reddish green one that simply blows me away with its combination of flavor and just the right amount of spiciness. We wolfed it down so quickly he brought us a second bowl within minutes of our sitting down. \n\nOur next surprise came after we ordered our entrees. The owner walked up to our table and put down two small plates of what I can only describe as seafood tostadas. This is evidently yet another free appetizer that comes with all meals. Picture a mini-tostada shell, on top of which is a well-marinated collection of what I think were tiny pieces of salmon, tomato, onion and green peppers. Everything fresh and with just a bit of a kick to it. Again, wow. \n\nMy entree was good, though I'll definitely order something new next time. The crab enchiladas come with a unique style of preparing the rice and beans, and a fresh salad as well. I wasn't a huge fan of the crab filling to be honest, but not because of quality or preparation reasons, more so my own personal taste. I'm going for a shrimp dish next time.\n\nThe owner was serving customers himself when I was there and he's an extremely friendly and polite Mexican gentleman. He's created a gem in this part of midtown Phoenix which isn't particularly known for its restaurants."""""""
5	"""I've been twice now to have my eyebrows threaded. Perfection. People compliment me on how great I look and can't quite put their finger on what is different (until I tell them). I've been asked if I've lost weight or if I've changed my makeup.\n\nThey're great about squeezing you in between appointments. I've been a walk in both times and did not have a long wait at all. \n\nTori is the bomb. She evaluated my existing shape and highlighted where there was a difference in width. I've had my eyebrows done all over high end places in New York (paying bookoo dinero) and this is by far the best. Period.\n\nGo here.\n\np.s. I just realized I haven't \checked in\"""" in forever. I go to see Toni like clockwork. (Except for an unfortunate period when I visited family back in New York. God I missed her.)  I pulled up Yelp to add the address to my phone book permanently. This really is the way to go.\n\nAlso, I've been once for a facial using a Groupon. It was much more than I expected. A dermatologist a long time back had expressed that facials were a waste of time. I have to disagree. \n\nYes, there is the relaxing component of being pampered. However, I felt like I was educated on the current condition of my skin and was walked through each step of the facial. (I suppose if you're not into learning what's going on this might not be of interest. But I found it educational.) \n\nI had taken a very clear look of myself at home before going for a facial. When I got home I peered into my 10X mirror and was quite pleased. Not only had my pores been cleaned thoroughly, my skin was smooth and soft as butter. \n\nWhen I went to check out I didn't feel pressured into buying anything. However, I picked up two reasonably priced products. (I didn't feel uncomfortable asking for the price on each item either. Nor was I given \""""the look\"""". You know what I mean.)\n\nAnyway, as you can tell by my glowing review I love this place. I just wish money grew on trees and I could go there more often to be pampered."""""""
2	"""This place rates as a decent \place to park your carcass,\"""" but outside of that, it doesn't have many redeeming qualities.  It is an older hotel located behind a strip club.  The card readers in the door locks barely work.  It took me a dozen tries just to get into my room.  The breakfast is mediocre at best.  But thankfully there's a Waffle House next door, so don't even bother with the stale pastries and cereal.  If I had to spend more than eight hours in this hotel (and seven of those sleeping) I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  But as a place simply to spend the night, it'll suffice."""""""
4	"""Okay, Valle Luna is not going to win any awards for being a \great\"""" Mexican restaurant.  Is it bad?  Hell no!  That is evident by the fact that it is rare that you can go there any night of the week and find a parking space in a pretty spacious lot.  That, more than reviews, tells you a lot.  If you build it, people will come.\n\nThere is actually nothing wrong with Valle Luna.  The people who work there range from good to a few who are very good.  We have almost never been seated immediately but the wait isn't that bad.  The \""""waiting room\"""" is a bit weird, with uncomfortable benches forcing everyone to kinda stare at each other.\n\nThe drinks are good, tasty and not bad for the price.  One of the salsas tends toward an 8 out of 10 rating.  The food is typical Americanized Mexican fare for the most part, but definitely plentiful ... I have never been able to finish it all without resorting to a doggie bag.\n\nThe decor is decent, the multiple dining rooms help keep the noise down.  The clientele ranges from attractive young singles to those in the senior range and there is a good mix of couples-to-small groups.\n\nThey rate 4-stars because they are most definitely a cut above any \""""chain\"""" Mexican place I have visited in Phoenix and yet also manage to outdo many of the mom & pop local places due to their cleanliness and consistency.  They are almost, but not quite, one of the best in Phoenix in my book.  My 4-star rating compares them to other restaurants in the Phoenix area.  If I rated them against restaurants I have visited in Mexico, San Diego, El Paso and a few other places I would drop them to a 3-star rating and if I rated them against a couple of my favorite ever places, regardless of location, price, cleanliness, etc. they might fall to a 2-star.  But then again I have only found a total of less than the fingers on my right hand that would rate a solid 5-star."""""""
5	Serving what seem to be impeccable service and standards, Roka Akor pays incredible homage to what Japanese cuisine is, was and will be in the distant future. Besides the somewhat shakey service, the food and ambiance are beaten to perfection with the branch of a Bonzai. Even the ice for the cocktails are carefully crafted to fit perfectly into the glass. Every now and then you can see the bartender sawzalling away at big blocks of ice for the drinks including the ones made with their homemade shochu.\n\nWith a menu full of fish flown in from Japan, I ordered a wide array of their specialties to get a better idea of why Bon Appetit magazine rated this restaurant Top 10 in the nation. I started off with their salad with wasabi ginger dressing. It had a great balance of fresh greens and roasted vegetables. Then came the butterfish tataki. With a clean unobtrusive tone, it would blow the shingles off Roy Yamaguchi on his bestest night. The American side of me flourished next with an order of the chili serrano hamachi roll. Far from anything exotic or novel, it flew under my radar much faster than Flight 447. Without giving up hope, the chef's sashimi selection came with scallop, tuna, and salmon. The freshness and quality was so conspicuous that the only adulteration I could sense was from the molestation it took by the TSA from its recent flight. \n\nThe food was coming out with precision timing and I was thoroughly enjoying my honeycomb shochu throughout the entire meal. The sweet potato tempura and sweet buttered corn came next. Unfortunately, the sweet potato was of the North American genus that has the orange hue rather than its Asian counterpart with more of the clear hue. The sweet buttered corn made up for the prior disingenuous buffoonery. Much like the butterfish, it was another highlight of the night with its sweet ghee flavor and texture much difficult to execute on a grill. Lastly, the glazed baby back ribs came about. It tasted like it had been slowly cooked for hours. Tender with well-balanced burnt marks, it finished me off with an ending quite more than happy. \n\nThe dinner was coming to a close and I have to admit I was thoroughly impressed with almost every aspect of this establishment. However, there are two things I'd like to see a change. Find a new source for sweet potatoes and get a water filtration system because the tap water tastes way too tappy. Starbucks has one and they're nowhere near eloquent as Roka. Until next time.
1	OOOHHHH Tropical Sno I had such high hopes for you, yet i was very let down!.  After spending over a week in Kauai and eating more shave ice (not shaved ice) than is humanly possible, i know what good and great shave ice should taste like.  The ice should be as fine as snow  and melt effortlessly the second it hits the tongue. Not crunchy and chewable like a sno cone. Its should be dense enough to hold up to the flavoring and not implode the second it is handed to you because it wasn't packed well. \n\nThe flavors should be pleasantly sweet and somewhat natural.  You should be able to identify what flavors were actually added to the shave ice. The flavors here were sickly sweet, with artificial sweet being all you could taste.  The cream topping should subtly enhance  the overall flavor with a hint of coconut not drown it in a sea of sugar (If it was coconut cream its news to me, but the sign only said cream topping).\n\nGreat shave ice makes you crave a second one, bad shave ice gets thrown away!\n\nNeither me or my hubby liked this place at all and we specifically searched this place out so we have a little taste of Kauai again.  The entire trip home (all 19 miles of it) all we could talk about was how horrible this shave ice was and that we need to open up our own shave ice company.
4	I was awakened from my foodie revery of perfectly seasoned babaganooj on home-made bread by an eerie orgasmic humming. I looked up and saw Ken, his eyes glazed over, humming to his glass of iced Turkish coffee, a delight of his own creation. When Tony, the owner (along with his wife Juliette) came over to investigate, he decided he had to have one too.\n\n     This took place at Olive Tree Mediterranean Market and Grill in North Phoenix. Unlike most small groceries, Olive Tree is bright, clean and cheerful. The shelves are stocked with fascinating Middle Eastern delights - jars of olives and tahini, an interesting assortment of cheeses, sweet treats that I'd never seen before. You order at the counter   \nfrom a good size selection of ethnic dishes, plus a few typical American items. Food is then brought to your table in a sectioned off area.\n\n     I had discovered Olive Tree on Restaurant.com. Since we had to order $35 of food from the menu, we ended up with quite an array of dishes. Now that I think of it, the humming started with the above-mentioned baba. This roasted, pureed eggplant concoction is found in most Middle Eastern restaurants, with varying results. It can be very flat tasting if too much tahini (sesame paste) is mixed in, or it may be over-spiced. This baba was beautiful, with all the tastes dancing in our mouths. Julliette makes her own bread to go with it. The texture is very different from pita (even the pita served here was selected with great care), crustier and chewy. A special of the day was stuffed cabbage. About the same size and shape as the stuffed grape leaves (which were delicious), these are lighter and lemony good - a real treat. We shared a combination kebab plate with chicken, kefta, and shish-kebab skewers. This paled in comparison to the other dishes, since the meat was on the dry side. The baklava was quite good, it wasn't soggy with syrup, so the layers of phyllo dough made a satisfyingly crunchy noise.\n\n    After lunch we did a little shopping. We got some delicious feta cheese and something called Chicago cheese, which reminded me of mozzarella. I could have bought more, but Ken wisely herded me out the door.
5	I've been going here on occasion for the past 5 years.  It's a great spot to go with friends for excellent beer and grub.  The servers and bartenders have always been really cool and friendly, and come around frequently to check on us.\n\nI am particularly fond of the Raj IPA, but I'll drink whatever beer we order (and then some!).  Their hummus is also nomnomnom.\n\nThe only downside is that if you come during the busier times, you might have to wait a while for a table/seats.  It can and does get packed.
2	I don't get what all the hype is about. \n\nCame on a Monday night in time for happy hour. Arrived around 5:45pm. We were one of the only tables in the entire restaurant. \n\nThe waitresses weren't very helpful. We had to flag them down to order before happy hour ended. The menu is huge, mainly consisting of deep fried or baked items. I'm not a fan of sushi restaurants that aren't real sushi. I had a hard time finding fresh, raw items on the menu. Finally decided on a spicy salmon, spicy tuna, Little Mermaid (shrimp tempura w/spicy crab), Lollipop (white fish, salmon, avocado) and Dynamite (shrimp tempura with baked fish on top with a creamy sauce). They were all OK. I've had better, fresher sushi elsewhere. I won't be back. \n\nAlso, the bathrooms didn't have any toilet paper or paper towels to dry your hands.
4	Had lunch here today with Lynn W. and Rand H. Well the the place is new and the decor is well done and comfy . They have enough food selections to classify them as a super buffet. As far as the food goes it was all pretty good with most of your typical Chinese buffet selections . Some of the extra items were steamed clams , double baked potatoes ,fresh strawberries and Vienna sausage. The macaroni salad I had was very good and i went back for more as was the stuffed shrimp. There is also a sushi bar but I did not try any on this trip. The food here makes them a 4 star eatery and as far as the staff goes they need to be a lot more happier with a name like happy buffet.
5	I sometimes have dreams where I am at Donovan's, only to wake up in a sad state knowing that it was all a lie. This place is the place I go to when I want to thank my taste buds for doing their job 24/7!\n\nSo far I have been there two times with some friends, and each time I went I felt like it was Thanksgiving all over again: trying to fit just another delicious bite of food before heading home. A doggie bag / box is a disgrace to the food! Both times I have been there I have had the prix fixe menu with the twin steak medallions with blue cheese and port demi-glace. It's amazing! The blue cheese works well with the demi-glace with a mix of sweet and tangy-creamy tastes as the opening gig, followed by the main show of the amazingly tender and slightly bloody steak. This was one of the only places I have been to that cooks the steak rare plus, which provides all the melt-in-your-mouth goodness with a lot less blood that rare sometimes gives. \n\nThe soup is always great, the first time I had lobster bisque, second time I had vegetable and hearty chunks of bacon. They always supply you with a fresh loaf of sourdough bread, crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside: perfect for sopping up the soup!\n\nAs for the dessert, I can't get over how awesome the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is! It is about the size of a small football, and around 1.5 inches deep. Simply divine! \n\nBoth times I have been to Donovan's the servers worked as a team and introduced themselves as such. We had three people attending to our needs, and everything was brought out speedily including some samples of the sides. Never had such great service, it seems like they weren't competing for tips, leaving a table belonging to another server to hang out and dry just because it wasn't there's. It was very refreshing to know that at all times someone was looking out for you.\n\nFinally, the happy hour here is the best I have ever been to! From 4-8 you can get 7 dollar cocktails and martinis that are very good for the money, although at normal price I would shy away from the drinks. Not only can you get half price drinks, from 4-6 you also can have all the prime rib sandwiches you can eat. Mini sandwiches filled with tender prime rib, dripping with cheese, with grilled onions and mushrooms rounding out this complimentary wonder of the world! \n\nI may have not been to as many higher end steak places as some of my fellow yelpers, but I do suggest you give this place a try!
2	"""In search of a good breakfast place I came upon The Good Egg. I was definitely disappointed. I should have read more of the yelp reviews so to have avoided this place. I agree with Scott S that this place should be called \The Bland Egg.\""""\n\nI ordered the \""""Hearty One\"""" crepe egg which included bacon, ham, sausage, mushroom & grilled onion that came with an English muffin. A crepe egg is whipped egg whites with a crepe. Despite all the ingredients in the crepe it lacked flavor, it was literally bland, no seasoning at all. No amount or variety of hot sauce that was available on the table could salvage it. In addition, the crepe was this boring beige color which was fitting because the dish was boring as beige.\n\nMy friend ordered the \""""BLT Supreme\"""" which normally comes on a 12 grain whole wheat toast with 6 slices of sugar cured bacon, lettuce, tomato, sliced avocado & mayo. However, she requested it to be on white toast instead. It came out with a side of seasoned potatoes. The bread came out burnt and too dry. The mayo was barely visible...it was pretty much inedible sandwich. Instead of returning the plate back to the kitchen, my friend just ate the BLT without the bread.\n\nMy other friend ordered the \""""Eye Opener Combo\"""" which came with pancakes, 2 eggs and a few slices of bacon. It wasn't anything spectacular as that can be ordered just about anywhere.\n\nTo sum it all up, healthy food doesn't mean it should lack flavor, but that is exactly how this place was. None of the dishes stood out and in fact it was all around bland and blah. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."""""""
2	"""My initial impression of the service here was: awwwkward... Then the server made me feel like that Pretty Woman chick on Rodeo Drive. When I asked for a drink menu, the reply was \oh, we don't do frozen drinks here.\"""" WHAT?! THIS ISN'T APPLEBEE'S?! No wonder there was valet out front! Hello, sir, I don't allow frozen drinks here either. I actually walked in knowing I'd be ordering the steak off the restaurant week menu, so I really wanted a glass of red, but I was completely turned off after that.\n\nThe pastries here oozed with butter which can be considered decadent, but I kind of thought it was a little disgusting, especially after time passes and those pastries get a little cooler than room temperature. I guess that's what I get for not eating them quick enough? \n\nThe vichysoisse was pretty good, and the steak was decent, but not memorable. I can't even remember if we got dessert, but I'll just say aside from the initial impression, the rest of the night just wasn't memorable."""""""
2	"""Literally, the smallest tacos you will ever encounter anywhere in your entire life and I am not exaggerating. 3 tacos were $12 and they were each smaller than the palm of my hand, and my hands are TINY. I can't even imagine what the average built adult would think about them...\n\nSpecialty cocktails were good, but pricey. Entree entirely too small to satisfy any amount of hunger and overpriced (I'm serious, the \tortillas\"""" are the size of Ritz crackers; this is not an entree but hors d'oeuvres). \n\nAmbiance was nice, beautifully lit and decorated, dark, Catholic inspired, chandeliers, etc. There's a full bar and seating is nice.\n\nService was...eh, nothing special. They took our chips and salsa away long before we were even close to being done with them an didn't ask prior.\n\nThe desserts were way bigger than any entree I saw and were mediocre at best. \n\nThe food itself tasted good, but there was NOWHERE near enough to satisfy any person in just one serving.\n\nIf you want insanely overpriced appetizers masquerading as real food, you'll like this place."""""""
2	"""I really (really really) wanted to love Aiello's.  I am a voracious champion of the red-sauce joint, very different than the traditional Italian-from-Italy meal.  The catch phrase \East Coast Italian\"""" spoke leagues of poetry to me - calamari, eggplant parm, and mounds and mounds of tiramisu.  Upon examining the menu, my grandmother and I saw Scungili (similar to conch) and were sold - she was transported back to her days in Brooklyn and felt an atavistic longing to give the place a try.  Aiello's has made us an offer that we couldn't refuse.  With husbands in tow, we went for a nice dinner and a trip down memory lane.\n\nDisarmed from the get-go, we walked in to Chef Joe working the room and eventually getting around to seating us.  You can tell he's a professional charmer, he immediately asked us why we didn't answer the phone that was ringing at the host's stand.  Our waiter and Chef Joe took turns all night proffering jokes and witticisms - I didn't have a huge problem with it and chalked it up to friendliness, but my husband thought it came off as smarmy to the point of distraction.  I had only wished that Chef Joe might spend a little more time in the actual kitchen.\n\nBread basket contained a homemade foccacia and a delicious accompaniment of cherry peppers in olive oil.  Probably the best thing we had all night.  Caesar salad was missing a dose of anchovies and garlic - rather bland and one-dimensional.  Calamari and fried zucchini were both oily and needing of a good squeeze of lemon and marinara for dipping in order to make them a little more palatable.  For the entrees, my Tortelloni alla Panna were so-so - the pasta was fresh and tasty but again, the cream sauce was one dimensional rather than being luxe and silken as you'd want it to be.  My husband had a chicken breast Saltimbocca that was almost inedible - it was so overcooked, he could barely cut through it.  Very disappointing.  Scungili over linguine was indeed tender, but in need of a heavy dose of red pepper and not at all memorable.  The homemade ravioli of the night was prosciutto and caramelized onion - again just so-so.  Not a single taste on the table to challenge us to come back.\n\nThe night was finished with Chef Joe's \""""Pick a Number\"""" game - he pulls a random number (1-80, I believe) out of what looks like a carafe and if it's the one you've guessed, your meal is on him (minus the alcohol).  I kind of wished we'd won, because 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and wine came to $50/pp before tax and tip.  I'm not a price queen, but if I'm spending the money, wow me a little.  All that flair and attention in the dining room, but none of it in the kitchen.  There are WAY too many great Italian places in Phoenix to not bring your A-game every time.  Plain and simple."""""""

1	Lube shop is an absolute joke.  Sure, they're open on Sunday, but they've employed a bunch of freaking idiots.  \n\nI used to manage a Jiffy Lube for over 5 years and I never met an oil filter I couldn't get off.  These nincompoops made me sign a waiver because my oil was low and then called me 2 hours later to let me know they couldn't get my oil filter off.  \n\nI said, wow, ok you guys suck but can you please put a couple quarts of oil in my car and I'll pay for it?  Their response?  Nope, can't do it.  I laughed and said I had never heard of such a thing from a lube shop and to please put the manager on the phone.  \n\nManager, Tony, came on the phone and was as pompous and idiotic as the first moron who picked up the phone.  They simply can't charge me to put a couple of quarts of oil in my car.  Told me I needed to come down and buy the oil and put it in myself.\n\nOk, you suck, but I'll come down and buy the oil.  Then I encounter a female assistant manager at the checkout desk chewing out an employee.  Didn't care that I was standing right here waiting for her to check me out, she just keep ripping this kid a new one over nothing for several minutes while I waited.\n\nStay away from getting your oil changed here.  Stay away from this Walmart if you can.
3	The food quality was excellent as usual. I like Genghis SO much better than YC's because of the freshness of the meat.  At YC's it's always frozen.  While it's kind of gross to see raw meat out, it is always kept cold and is much better than the frozen meats at YCs.\n\nThis restaurant hasn't been in this location very long. It used to be a My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. I am glad to see that there is a Genghis Grill close to my location. However in this new location, it seems that they need to improve on some things. The atmosphere wasn't great nor did it do anything great for the experience.  They have several flat screen tv's and the music was quite loud.  It was almost too loud for a restaurant atmosphere.\n\nThere was a considerable wait for the server to come with our beverages and then consistently over the course of our meal, our server was rarely seen and quite slow. \n\nAfter we received our beverages but before we went through the line, we saw a large roach crawling on the floor next to our table.  My husband told another server who took care of the problem and then told the manager. It took a little while for me to get my appetite back but once I did we proceeded quickly through the line.\n\nThe line, again had great food albeit a bit messy and the handles on the spoons for serving the food were sticky.\n\nAfter our meal, it took a very long time to get the check. We first requested it from the manager and then from another server than our own and then finally from the manager again.  It was almost 15 minutes before we received it.\n\nWhile the food was good, I was disappointed with the service and atmosphere.  I really like Genghis and want it to be good.  The location at Tempe Marketplace is better for cleanliness and service.
4	We stayed two nights in regular rooms and one night in a Casita. By far, the best way to stay at this hotel is to get a good deal on a Casita. Each has its own covered parking space and share a small pool and Jacuzzi with a couple other Casitas. They are very spacious downstairs with a living room, dining area, and kitchen. There is a large fridge and microwave. Just bring some plates and utensils. \n  A big draw for this hotel is the water park. And as many other reviewers have stated it can be extremely crowded--even during the off season because the hotel lowers rates considerably. The crowds can be discouraging because there will be no available lounge chairs. If it is a crowded Saturday, expect the atmosphere to be very rowdy with lots and lots of partying. \n\nTips:  \n1) Get up early to get the cozy, padded lounge chairs on the Squaw Patio (ask the attendant to direct you). In fact, there is a private area nestled above that patio area that is even cooler.  You will be so glad you got up early!\n2) Spinato's Pizza is a great Chicago style pizza joint that delivers to the hotel.
4	"""This has been my \go to\"""" post office since I moved into my current apartment a few years ago.  Plenty of parking, a separate drive with 2 blue mail drop boxes, and a lobby full of post office boxes.  You have access 24 hours a day to the PO boxes, which is convenient \n\nThere's a second lobby behind glass doors, and that's the actually where the post office workers work, and where you would get your counter service for mailing stuff, stamps, etc.  The staff here isn't so bad, but its the post office, so don't expect to much.  There's a lady that usually waits on me, and she's rather nice.  I think there's also a gentleman who works on the counter, and he's a bit more gruff, but gets you what you need.\n\nBack in 2011, my mailbox was broken, and it took my apartment complex 6 months to fix.  Every Saturday morning I came in here to get my mail from the counter staff, and overall, it was okay.  Some days were good, other days were not.  The later you go in on a Saturday, the longer the line.  Your better off getting there first thing to avoid the crowds.  Most likely, your going to have some kind of wait.  Staff was friendly and decent most of the time, and the wait varied depending on a number of factors.  Some Saturdays I was the only one in line, others, the line felt like it was a mile long.  98% of the time, there's only been 2 counter staff working. Its the govt...and the post office did layoffs, so thats most likely why its a line some times.\n\nOverall, I'm reasonably satisfied with my experiences here.  I still use the drop boxes outside often and frequently to mail stuff out, and its great to live close to a place like this.  As annoying as the post office is at times, I like being able to save a day on mailing and take my stuff right here."""""""
1	Just passing through town,stopped in to get a pedicure and got the women from hell with a bad attitude.  down right rude customer service skills. don't have her redo anything cause she will get mean and nasty with you. it was just one lady here who was the rotten apple, wish I could remember her name.but the other people that work there know who she is.. should have gone to Valley Nails in Mesa that was recommend by a lady from the hotel.
4	When I saw the long line for Jamba Juice, I decided to check out what this Juju Berri place was all about.  I'm glad I did.  I'm a fro-yo, heavy on the tart kind of girl so this place is a dream come true for me.\n\nI've made two visits thus far, and apple was my favorite flavor.  Unfortunately, the counter girl informed me that it wasn't a standard flavor.  The next time I tried the kiwi, which wasn't as amazing but still good.  I'm not that big on toppings, maybe a raspberry or two- but they do have a wide array of sinful and not so sinful toppings.\n\nThe decor is pretty stinkin' adorable.  My favorite is the light up topping bar area, but I'm obnoxious like that.  Like too many places, the choice in cup sizes seem to be giant and extra giant.  Just remember not to fill it up, because that $.37 an ounce can add up!\n\nThe service I've encountered has been pretty solid, and the fact that this cool of a place can be found in Peoria makes me pretty happy.\nI know some people don't get the fro-yo thing (shame on you) but I'm happy to see this addition to the valley!
5	I've been here twice now, both times I ordered one of their Tortas and both times I was definitely satisfied with my meal.\n\nThe first time was a few months ago and I tried the Tortas Del Rey; their signature torta.  This thing is absolutely HUGE!  Everything in the torta was cooked perfectly and the service was excellent.\n\nThe next time I ordered something new on the menu called the Torta Norte\u00f1a. This torta has grilled steak, grilled onions, jalapenos, cheese, avocado and a mayo chipotle sauce that made the sandwich extremely tasty.\n\nI am looking forward to the next time at Los Reyes, this food hits the mark!
5	We checked this place out because we had a groupon. You can also get discounted certificates for Fuego Bistro on restaurant.com, and they occasionally do offers through LunchClub.\n\nThis place has an extensive drinks menu. We got mixed drinks and loved them. I think mine was a flavored mojito, and his was something tropical. The Seared Ahi Tuna Mini Tostadas were OK, but the Angus GriIIed New York Strip Steak was an absolute showstopper. \n\nAs others have said, this place is hard to find. Look for Apollo's on the east side of 7th Street (giant lambda sign) and park in the lot just east of them.
4	"""Good joint. Brought my friend who have not had good Indian food there. He was willing to try again and i took him there. Guess what - He liked it. Whatever he ordered looked like baby's poop - slimy and greenish, but it tasted really good. My own chicken was quite tasty as well. Everyone gets complimentary bread and some chicken (?!?). Buffet WAS unimpressive. \nHowever, all in all this is a real nice place for some tasty food.\n\n\I like\""""\n\nEugene"""""""
5	"""Man, I loved this pizza. I drive past this place on 8th St and Indian School every day and have been dying to try it. Finally, on a night the hubby was not home and I had the unappealing task of cooking something, I discovered I had a 2-4-1 coupon from the Entertainment book. To me, that is the best way to try something for the first time. If I didn't like it, hey at least I didn't pay full price. The coupon was for B1G1 free pizza, so we got two 14\ (one pepperoni and one cheese). The total came out to $12.37 for both pizzas...not bad. It was your typical NY style pizza and I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't very greasy. This was compared to the dripping with grease pizza we had at Pinos al Centro. The crust on the pizza at Mamma Mia's was also delicious. A little bit chewy and not overly thin or thick...just right. Each pizza yield approx 9 slices and I am excited that we've got dinner tomorow night too! Gotta love leftover pizza. \n\nWe parked in the back parking lot which can be accessed by a little side street. Getting to the location wasn't bad until you start seeing all of the rush hour traffic backing up right at the intersection of 7th St and Indian School. But at 6:20pm on a Thursday, it didn't take me long to get in and out. The employees were extremely friendly and the guy let me exit out the back, through their small kitchen, with the pizzas. With a 2 yr old in my arms and 10 yr old behind me carrying the pizzas, I thought that was very nice. \n\nI am pleasantly surprised to have a new local favorite pizza joint. I love Z Pizza, but Mamma Mia has got it down for the traditional style pizza. I seem to recall signs in the front saying something about 2 slices of pizza and a drink for approx $3 which is a smokin deal. Scared to tell the husband about that one since he may start to live there. Either way, I la-la-la-love it."""""""
5	Why didn't I know about this place? I guess my friend Sarah has been hounding me to go here for years, but tonight was my first visit. Where's my time machine so I can go back and eat here more.\n\nI was torn whether to give it a 4 or a 5... The decor is an afterthought - in fact, the restaurant part of it seems to be tacked on to an international foods market. The market side has some amazing foods you won't find in many other places around the Valley - definitely worth going out of your way to check out. \n\nThere were 3 of us, and we grabbed a table and sat down. It didn't take long to decide what we wanted - turns out we just about wanted a little bit of everything. The prices on the menu looked like they were from another time. I thought they gave us the old menus by accident. Let me put it this way - the prices were so low, I questioned the quality of the food I was about to eat... \n\nWe placed our order, and within a few minutes our table was filled with plates of beautiful food. This was as troubling as the prices - fast food prices and fast food service usually mean fast food and subsequent ring sting. Well, this is not the case. The food here was fantastic. I would say the food is a solid 4. It's not the best example of gyros and hummus etc that I've had, but it ranked quite high. It was delicious and flavorful, and everything seemed to be really fresh. \n\nI cleaned my plate and picked at just about everything - we all shared a bit. Every mouthful was a treat. The service was more fast and efficient than it was friendly, but I never felt unwelcome. In a place like this, I'd rather have a no bullshit sort of experience. Just get this food into my bloodstream as expediently as possible. Really though, the service was plenty nice. \n\nAfter we finished eating, we wandered around the market side and shopped a bit. We wanted to take so many things home with us - teas, sweets, spices, honey, and assorted unique items... We're definitely going back. \n\nThis is a divey hole-in-the-wall that deserves all the praise it is getting. If it turns out to be as reliable and consistent as I've heard it is, we're going to be regulars. If you twisted my arm to complain, I would say it is pretty inconveniently located (or extra convenient depending on from where and how you get there) - I just find it a bit of a pain in the ass trying to drive around and make turns on Apache since the Light Rail went live. \n\nI can tell you this - if you're thinking of eating at Pita Jungle down the street - give this a shot instead. I still love Pita Jungle, but this wins on price and speed, ties on deliciousness, and only loses on decor. It's not a first date spot - it's more of a 4th date spot... impress her with the awesome and interesting eclectic hole in the wall joint.
4	Been in Phoenix over a year and just went for my first pedi/mani at Ken's . On my mostly daily drive down Indian School, Kens sign for mani/pedi and eyebrow wax for $33 keep catching my eye. So finally I took the bait.  I walked in and every pedi-chair was filled - thought maybe it was a party but nope most of them were individuals in for some pampering. \n\nThe people were nice and they got me seated in a massaging pedi-chair right away. So off for about an hour of pampering and relaxation for only $33 - how can you beat that and I still have eyebrows!!
3	Okay, so its probably unfair for me to review cartel.  I went there to pick up beans.  It was pretty clear that the beans I was buying weren't roasted recently.  (They told me they were about to roast.)  But, I was desperate.  In all fairness, the beans smelled awesome. Yet, the taste didn't get close to the smell---not delicate at all---much more grocery store like.  I will go back and try when their beans are fresh.\n\nAtmosphere looked great.  I was more than slightly (ehmmm) insulted when they suggested that I was dropping off my kid for college.  Last I checked, I wasn't nearly of that age group.
4	"""I have been flying somewhere for business or pleasure just about every week for 15 years... Most airlines operate on the basis of despising their passengers.

5	I never realized that Horse & Hound was even there, right across the street from my bank, er, credit union, lending institution or whatever. I thought it was part of the ClubHouse, until my neighbor told me she was a server there and I should stop in and drink with her friends :D \nSo I did, duh. \nNothing really struck me as too great, actually. Cheap drinks, sure. Pool tables, shuffleboard and OTB. It's bright, probably one of the brightest bars that I've ever went to. Oh, and I don't mean bright because of all the ASU students either. I haven't eaten there yet, but I'm sure it will happen. Lately, it's been the first bar on my crawl, then The Derby, then....
3	Went to see Wicked on Friday night. It was HOT! Please someone turn on the air in this MF place. Acoustics are good and so were the seats.\n\nDang, people, could you please dress up for once in your life! Also, there is no etiquette anymore! This chick was texting and checking her blackberry like every 5 minutes. \n\nBathrooms were horrible to get to, but the wait wasn't bad. \n\nWicked gets 5 stars but it was so hot in Gammage that it only gets 3!
5	OhhhhhEmmmmGeeee!!! I totally heart this place!!!!\nMy friends and I came here for the very first time and...it's just...so...heavenly! I just had to try a scoop of the pineapple sorbet and coconut sorbet. It was pleasant. After my friends and I ate our 2 scoops we discovered that this place was actually featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate. First off, vanilla ice cream just sounds so plain and simple. Second, I am so-not into salted sweet stuff (salted butter caramel just doesn't sound pleasing to my taste buds).  But we went ahead and ordered the Toffee Banofi Sundae which is consisted of double scoop vanilla bean with fresh bananas, toffee butter crunch, salted butter caramel and whipped cream (Alton Brown's recommendation - Food Network). You've got to put each little pieces of heaven in each spoon and savor the flavor! The combination of all these goodness is so perfectly put together. It's going to be hard to imagine eating ice cream else where. This place totally rocks! \nI have to also admit that sometime it may seem that Yelpers might bring too much of a hype on some places, but you really never know unless you try. Even though some recommendations don't necessarily sound pleasing to your senses, you should have an open taste bud to try new things because you can discover something quite heavenly (it may shock you). \nTry this place if you haven't...it's seriously delicious!!!
2	"""I seem to be the only person in the Valley that does not love this dog park. I liked it better before it was \improved\"""". There was more space for dogs to run and spread out. Now the park is carved up into smaller sections and very crowded. I have seen more dog fights here than in any dog park in the Valley.\n\nI think the real problem here is the people. The same people who illegally park their rented BMWs in handicapped spots at Fashion Square bring there pit bulls and accessory dogs here and are completely oblivious when they get aggressive/go to the bathroom. \n\nI actually saw a woman put her four year old in the park then go back to her car to get her dog. Of course all the other dogs surrounded the little guy, who was terrified. The woman had the nerve to come back to the park and yell at the people standing around for not watching her kid. (I was far enough away that she was back before I could walk across the park, but trust me, it was one of the 'What would you do?' scenarios) There also seem to be a lot of professional dog sitters who bring 5 or 6 dogs to the park and then \""""pretend\"""" not to notice when the dog squats.\n\nLong story short - in a pinch I'll go there if it's empty but I leave once the Ed Hardy crowd comes in."""""""
4	"""I don't go here often, but every time I do visit there are quite a few people in this store.\n\nI hope this is not just me, but there is something satisfying about walking down the aisles at a dollar store, looking at a lot of crap that you probably don't need but think you do, \just in case\"""" (insert scenario) happens. \n\nNow, I  guess it isn't fair to say that everything is crap, because they do have some awesome things like a huge variety of gift bags, party decorations, and craft projects.\n\nI ended up getting a decorative tray when I came here though..I have no idea what I will use it for, but dude, it only costs a dollar!"""""""
4	The Herb Box always seemed like a place I should love, it had all the elements of a restaurant I'd love. I've been there for lunch a handful of times and it was always a nice lunch, but that was all it was... nice. \n\nI recently came across their brunch menu and it looked so good I wanted to try again. I had brunch there Sunday and really enjoyed it. First, I've always liked the decor and atmosphere at the DC Ranch location. We sat outside cooled by their large umbrellas and misters. \n\nWe ordered the Strawberry Lassi: blended plain yogurt, fresh strawberries, and ice- not quite like the lassis I've had at Indian restaurants, but like a very good not-too-sweet smoothie.  \n\nMarket Street BLT: Grilled bread with an over-easy egg (mine came out over medium, but I was fine with that), crisp pancetta (better than bacon in my opinion), arugula, and tomato. It was a very good sandwich. \n\nUrban Market Steak Salad. Great steak and a good combo of salad toppings: red peppers, corn, avocado, candied pecans, and gorgonzola. \n\nSome of the other brunch menu items looked great, so I think I'll be going back for breakfast/bruch with a new sense of appreciation for the Herb Box.
4	It's dog friendly & the garlic mushroom omelet is amazing!!\n\nLove this place.  The menu is great.  I love corn beef & hash - they serve it up a few different ways.  I typically don't eat omelets - but the waitress recommended the Garlic Mushroom Omelet and I love mushrooms so I gave it a try.  I was in love - in fact - I ate all of it!  The sherry wine sauce was delicious and I love the mushrooms.  The omelet was cooked perfectly.  We got a table outside and they brought out a dog bowl filled with water & ice for our pup.  \n\nThe coffee drinks were refreshing.  I had the Smoca Mocha.  The service is a bit slow - maybe b/c we were sitting outside.  \n\nThis is definitely a place we'll go back to for brunch.  The food is great and affordable.
1	Went here because we had bought a coupon off of LivingSocal.com. First the service was lacking. There was only two other tables seated yet it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us.  The food was mediocre tasting. The chickpeas were hard in the channa masala, the chicken tikka masala tasted burned and the shrimp in the shrimp kadahi was overcooked.  We ordered the food spicy and I found the food to be bland with just spice (heat). We did complain about the chicken tikka masala and they did switch it out for us.  The worst of it all was that they didn't accept the Livingsocial voucher. The manager gave us some lame excuse and claimed that he had a sign up stating that. It wasn't up that night for us to see. Frustrating!  I won't be going back.
5	I love this place. I've been here about 4 times in the past 2 months and have yet to be disappointed. Yes, the strip mall is not pretty but the restaurant is clean, well-decorated, and always nice and cool in the summer. \n\nThe food is what it's all about though. I'm addicted to the hot and spicy noodles with beef, would marry them if it were legal. I'm also a big fan of the soups, especially lemon grass. My boyfriend, who is picky about wonton soup, love theirs.
2	I'm a fan of Hard Rock Cafes.  I don't really know why.  I collect guitar pins from them and have been to 30 or so in my life.  I don't always eat there, but I always go in and check it out.  The Phoenix one is one of the worst I've been to.\n\nThe old HRC on Camelback had a bit of personality.  I hated the location, but I loved how wide open it was.  Reminded me of the Honolulu one.  When they moved into downtown, I was excited to see them helping move downtown into the big time.  The location is great and it is a good place to grab a bite before a game.  The food is standard.  Never great, never bad.  Just across the board decent.\n\nMy problems with this HRC start with the layout.  The circular design is really bad for traffic flow, seating, wait staff movement, and sound.  This HRC lacks a true performance space which is terribly lame.  The bar is off to the side instead of being in the middle like almost every other HRC.  The shop is way too small and the merchandise is pretty lame.  This HRC is always so loud that it is impossible to have a conversation with your group.  \n\nThe other problem I have with this HRC stems from an incident where my wife and I went before a game.  She left her hat on the seat when we left and we remembered about 100 yards down the road.  Turned around, went back in, and told the hostess.  She said she would check and then she came back and said they didn't find anything.  I argued with her because we had JUST LEFT and finally went back to our table where it was still sitting in the bench.  Way to go idiot.
1	"""YUCK!\nJust Yuck.\n\n  They have a large selection of coffee drinks you can get on their menu, each one I've tried was more unappetizing than the last. \n  On my first visit I opted for an iced toddy, my poison of choice. I watched the girl in the drive-thru make my drink and I was a little perplexed about what the hell she was doing. I know some places use a concentrate, then add water to cut it. I watched her as she first added cream to the bottom of the cup, then added water, then added the tiniest portion of toddy \concentrate\"""". What I ended up with was a large cup of watered down 1/2 & 1/2 with a slight watered down coffee taste. I don't get it. If you need to cut the toddy down, add the water and toddy concentrate first. I don't see how you can tell how light or dark the toddy is when you've already added cream to it. The main ingredient is coffee, which my cup barely had any of. When she handed me my cup, I asked the girl why she added the cream to the cup first and her response was just \""""that's the way we do it\"""".  On this same visit, my boyfriend got an iced americano, which was just as disgusting as my toddy. He asked me to take a sip to see if it tasted the same to me. The espresso tasted like it had either been burned or sitting for a while before she added it to the water. We were both really upset as we were really jones-ing for caffeine. Neither of us took more than a couple of sips before deciding to throw our drinks away. To add insult to injury, I gave the girl a 100% tip before she was rude to me and made us 2 undrinkable beverages. Next time I'll hang on to the gratuity until I have an actual interaction with my drink and barista.\n  On my second visit, I only came in because I had about an hour to kill while my car was at the Discount Tire in the same shopping complex. It was a hot day and I wanted something cold and refreshing. I went in and decided to skip the toddy (even though it's what I would have preferred to get) and decided to get an iced chai with a couple shots of espresso in it. I paid and waited a couple of mins for my drink. When my name was called I walked over to the little bar was she sat my drink down. It was 3/4 of the way full with barely any ice in it. What was this extra room for? I wasn't going to add creamer to my drink. A long line started to form and the barista got busy taking orders for other people. I sat there at the little window and waited for at least 5 mins trying to ask them for more ice. The barista kept walking by me, and ignored my presence. All I wanted was more ice. Finally another employee came up to me and asked \""""what do you want?\"""" very rudely. \""""more ice?\"""" i replied. She snatched the cup out of my hand and reluctantly went and got me more ice for my ICED drink. So rude. I left the building and decided to go wait at the tire shop instead. I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome in a business. On my way out I took a sip of my drink. Ew. It was sooooo sweet. I added the couple of shots of espresso to try and cut down on how sweet the drink was sure to taste but it didn't work. I ended up throwing my drink out before I got back to the tire shop, a mere 1 min walk from Xtreme Bean's front door to the tire shops entrance. \n\nI get it. You've got cute girls working here. Cute girls and free wi-fi. That may be enough for the sea of young dudes that seem to flock to this establishment, but not for me. You don't have to go far in this town to find great coffee, or at least decent coffee with better service. They may have gotten another star from me if the employees had been the least bit more accommodating,  but after 2 strikes I don't want to return to see if they'd get a 3rd or not."""""""
1	"""Simply put, I'll never go to this Subway again. \n\n I was on my way to work, in a rush and decided to stop at this location to get a quick sandwich. I ordered a veggie sandwich, which is something that is actually on the menu. The two \sandwich artists\"""" must have had something against non meat eaters as they berated me, in front of other customers, for choosing a meat free selection THAT IS ON THE MENU!!!

Needless to say I was furious but hinger won so I payed for my sandwich and left.\n\n When I got home that evening I wrote a letter to Subway with specific details of the incident.

2	So, i've been in this area many many times, just wanting a sandwich and not knowing where to go.  See scratch on Yelp and get excited---finally a place for that sandwich---and a place where i can pull out that laptop. \n\nWell, when my sandwich arrived I just knew it would not be good.  Don't get me wrong---it is presented quite nicely, but it was obvious that the bread was all wrong.  And, indeed, upon taste, the bread was just awful.  I expected much better from a french pastry-type shop. \n\nThe pastries looked (in size) like those you'd find in france.  But, if you know french pastries well, you can look at them and again tell it wasn't quite right.  Taste-wise, however, they were fine.  I've had much better---but I'd eat these again. \n\nIts a bit difficult to find.  Its on the north side of the street, in the strip mall with the huge grocery store.
5	I love this place!!! OK. where do I start.. Great place to stop in for a quick lunch. AMAZING outside grill, everything is good. Best cheeseburger I've ever had. I don't even like Salmon and theirs is good. Good salad bar and salads ( pasta, tuna etc..) The pizza and sushi.. again amazing!! And........ they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from. Also, they have a great breakfast. Omelet station and all. I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos. GREAT outside patio
2	There are alot of negative labels people throw on England and English culture, some true and some unfounded. Some of these are: poor weather, poor food, and poor women. If this place were actually British, you could throw on poor service as well.\n\nGreat location, poor service. They've got a pretty good selection of beers to choose from but the thing that kills this place for me is the service. I had to go up to the waitress to give my order and go to the cashier to pay my tab. It's not like the place was busy either. The only time she came to our table was to serve us our drinks. What's worse is that she just had an attitude the whole time too. It's a shame this place sucks because the area it's in is cool, as is the antique house it operates out of. Do yourself a favor and go hit up some other bar like Hanny's or even the bar across from this place.
5	This place is excellent. The staff is very helpful and sweet. The prices are very reasonable. I love the fact that you can pick and choose what flowers you want in your arrangement from the walk-in and they charge just by the flower... kinda like AJ's but less expensive. Or, of course, they can create one for you... and they are gorgeous, dense arrangements that last weeks and weeks. The shop is always decorated so creatively, it always inspires me! Every first friday you can stop by (for no cost) and learn how to arrange flowers. I love this place!
4	"""I love this place for what it is-a place to get cheap fabric and other assorted craft/sewing supplies. I know going in here that it isn't going to be clean, or quick, or easy to sort through the piles of material. \n\nWhen I shop for fabric, I'm only looking for knits (I make scarves out of super soft knits), which are located on the righthand side of the store near the back in a GIANT pile that is only haphazardly organized. Knits aren't sold in large quantities like most of the other fabric they have-they are mostly just small-ish pieces that almost all have holes or stains. You have to check the fabric yourself, because they won't do it for you when you go to have it measured. \n\nI'd say on average, most knits are between 1/2 yard to 3 yards in length that are in the pile of fabrics. The exception is the bins next to the knit piles, which typically have much smaller pieces of material and are usually irregularly shaped. I have found some great, super soft knits in these piles-think fabric that is used by James Perse, Ella Moss, Splendid...that's what these feel like. It requires a lot of digging to find usable amounts of material in the piles that are also hole- and stain-free, but it's worth it! Knits are only $1.99 a yard here, which is a phenomenal deal.\n\nThey sell other fabrics that would be used for costumes, tons of sparkly fabrics, plus fleece, upholstery fabrics (though they don't sell upholstery thread), and a bunch of threads in different levels of quality/quantity. They do sell needles but they are behind the register, and you order them by telling them which number you want from the \menu\"""" of smallish items. \n\nBEFORE YOU PAY AT THE REGISTER, you MUST have your fabric measured at one of the cutting stations-even if you don't plan to have the material cut! They measure it to figure out how much you are getting, then they make you a receipt and hold your material behind the register. When you are ready to pay, simply walk up with your receipt to the register and they'll calculate the total from your receipt and bring you your bag of fabric. They take most credit cards so I don't need to have cash here (it seems like the type of place where it would be cash-only, but thankfully it is not).\n\nCome here if you are prepared to spend time and effort finding the best and cheapest material around without all the glitz and glamour of a regular (i.e. chain) fabric store!"""""""
2	Maybe I'm just spoiled by the thrift stores of the Midwest, but Gracie's wasn't what I thought it would be at all. \nThe prices aren't really any cheaper than somewhere like Goodwill or Ross, some dresses were tagged for ten dollars or more.\nTheir selection is jam packed onto the rows by color (which is a great system, the color system) but didn't really seem to have any other organization stipulation. \nCome on, it's the size of a closet. You can do small, medium, large. \nAlso, most of their stuff was something that a little old lady would wear ... and where the hell do thrift stores in this hot place get so many winter clothes?! \nI don't know, certainly worth stopping in ... but you won't find much and it'll be taxed. \nI feel as though possibly I just have high standards for thrift stores. \nSee for yourself! :)
5	Friendly, fun, and chill.\n\nThis place is just great. As a recent transplant to Tempe I was afraid that it was all strip-Malls and beige. I couldn't bring myself to submit to drinking the slop the Seattle based place serves, then a friend told me about Cartel.\n\nI have a particular coffee drink need that is usually only met in New Zealand or Australia (a flat white). Seth makes a flat white to rival anything at home. The beans are delicious, and being there when they are roasting is amazing!\n\nMy only disappointment is that I can't walk there easily!
2	I really wanted to like this place but I've been there 3 times now and I just can't recommend it. The people are great but the food is just so-so and not worth the price. I've tried the chicken kabobs twice now and they were overcooked both times. My husband tried the pasta and it was overcooked as well. He originally ordered a feta burger but they were out of them at 6pm on a Friday night. The hummus is good although a little thin. I prefer Greeks Grill on Alma School to this place as the food is better and less pricey.
1	Sophie B. nailed this one on the head.\n\nI came here long after hearing how great it was, after many drives past the swanky slick exterior & logo, and...\n\nWTF? I ordered something that had chicken. It was so crap, I can't remember what the name was. A heaping mound of exotic, square-cut iceberg lettuce served as pallbearer to cuts of perfectly overdone chicken. There may have been a grain of salt or whisper of an herb at some stage; I can't recall. Overall, a marriage of supreme disappointment. \n\nMy lunch buddy had something just as memorable. And just as overpriced for what it was.\n\nATTENTION RESTAURANTEURS:  If I can make it better at home, then I'm staying home!
3	"""I've heard so many good things about this place. It seemed like it may be a favorite Phoenix lunch joint for cuisine aficionados and it looks like it is for some, but was only a-ok to me.\n\nThere was nothing gross or disgusting to me about the food. It was made with quality ingredients and had a decent taste...I guess I just felt that the food wasn't worth the price. Especially because I've had better tasting food for lesser or equal value at other places (such as La Grande Orange or La Boca).\n\nOverall, this place isn't bad. I just feel it's been hyped up and is the \trendy\"""" place to eat."""""""
3	Visit Greece without leaving Phoenix\n\nI'm on the hunt for great places to have breakfast along the light rail, and while I love creative twists on the classics I also appreciate the basics.  \n\nThe menu had a good variety at reasonable prices.   \n\nI had the tomato and feta omelette, stuffed and perfectly grilled.  The dish came with a side of fruit and I'm not talkin'  a little ramekin with a couple of grapes and a slice-o-melon - I'm talking a big bowl of fruit.  \n\nAthenian Express is a good place to keep in mind if you ever need a break from your old standards.
2	Loved the ambience and was really looking forward to this place, what after having loved lolo's I was really excited about another southern joint?! I havta say I am terribly disappointed with this place, not coming back here for food again\n\nThey darn sprinkle bacon on everything, especially when I told the waitress already that I am a vegetarian! Really insulting\n\nThe waitress could care less. When asked by one of the elderly women in our party about what is in the soup, she just said she didn't know and didnt even offer to go find out! Why be in service industry if you can't do the only thing you are supposed to do!? Ah well we tipped her $10 anyways, like I said as if she cares even if we didnt, just another day!
5	the coffee quality is as stellar here as the tempe location. they moved the clover here too. they serve a 12oz  from the clover in a ceramic cup and pair it with something to eat. for example, i had the finca la illusion with a clementine (its amazing btw). its a little bit more pricey than the drip from tempe cartel (the coffee i had was the most expensive by a dollar or two and it was five dollars). they were also pouring some single origin espresso when i was there which was cool. i don't know if they are regularly going to have some other espresso in addition to the black market. i think those are the major notably difference in the products they are serving.\n\nthey do not roast at this location, but they do carry all the coffees they have in tempe. i beleive, like in tempe, they sell bags of coffee and they will grind the beans for whatever device you use if you want them to. the location is smaller than the tempe cartel and a bit more upscale. it also seems like it is less crowded than the tempe location (to be fair, i came in on new years eve so i don't know how representative that is). all and all, really awesome. probably a better coffee experience than the tempe location, but the hours are much more restrictive.
4	"""Why there isn't a line out the door for the carnitas here I don't know. Maybe those in the know are just keeping it their little secret. \n\nWell, I'm glad I figured it out because it's the most delicious carnitas I've ever had. It's almost a succulent pork stew, really - lots of shredded pork in a rich, flavorful gravy. I had it first on a taco, but now I get it as a \meat only\"""" burrito with just onion, cilantro and red salsa. Pretty much pure burrito nirvana, cannot recommend it enough.\n\nOther things I've had here are very good also, but it's the carnitas that will keep me coming back week after week. \n\nAnd to top everything off, all the guys who work here are sincerely nice, friendly and always in a good mood. Which makes it all the more enjoyable. \n\nThank you Taqueria Mi Casita!"""""""
4	"""Everyone, in your best Joe Pesci (lethal weapon style) voice - \Ok, Ok, Ok\"""". Yes, just like Joe gets excited, I'm totally excited about this place. \n\nAfter dying to get there for like the last month, I finally made it. Uh oh, though, I look at the menu, and oh great more salads and panini's. I mean really?, is that what downtown needs. Hannys, postino, lisa g, local breeze, hob nob- great, sandwiches. :(\n\nThen (insert angelic chorus - \""""ahhhhhhhh\"""") the waitress walks through the specials. Lentil salad, salmon over greens, tofu pasta, garbanzo bean salad, et' voil\u00e0!\n\nLow and behold, I went with the lentil salad. What do NBA fans say?- \""""Its Fantastic\""""! A mixture of lentils, carrots, zucch - all over greens. Mmm, yum. The wife went on to have a panini, and you know what, I'll be eating crow for sure. Pears, Brie, walnuts all on wheat bread, then grill - mmmmmmm. \n\nLet's top it off with the chocolate mousse, shall we? Yes we shall!! Yes, ladies and gentlemen - another fine course. \n\nThe atmosphere is clean, but bright and casual. Give this place a shot- open your mind and have some fun!"""""""
5	This place is near my work so I have come here quite a few times for lunch.  Since it takes about 25 minutes for your pasty to be made I call ahead and tell them what I would like and then it is ready when I get there.  Just a tip for those who do not have a lot of time at lunch.  They also have the option to order them half-baked so you can pick them up on your way home from work and complete the baking at home to have them for dinner.   This place has awesome tasty pasties and they are very affordable need I say more?
4	I'm reviewing Happy Hour (they call it 'power hour').  I always look to yelpers to help me know what to order.  So here you go.\n\nThe bartenders always say that the filet sandwiches are the most popular but the hamburgers are the best.  I've had both. Both are good - but you know how awesome a good burger is don't you?  Get those.\n\nAlso must get the iceberg wedge bites.  How smart to make them small - and easy to divide up between the husband and I.  So happy.\n\nThe chicken - skip it.  Or just drive through McDonalds and get some on the way home if you want chicken nuggets.\n\nThe crab is good.  We only got it once cause my sister-in-law was visiting and insisted on getting them (we're stuck in our burger and iceberg wedge bite rut).  So ok, they are the best crab cakes I've had in years - really almost all crab and not all breading like other places.  But they serve them on little buns with bacon and lettuce - which is ok and if you're inventive you could pull the crab cakes off the buns eat them as crab cakes, then eat a little blt sandwich.\n\nThe drink menu is limited, but it's one reason we go there.  Why don't more places have a Manhattan on the happy hour menu? grrrr - leaves us going here or Donovan's all the time (which btw has the bigger and better Manhattan on the happy hour menu - they use Woodford Reserve - mmm - but the food is limited, and I find Mortons bar more cozy).  They do have a couple girly drinks - a Cosmo and some Palm Beach thingy.\n\nOh, and if you like a crowded rowdy popular happy hour, either go elsewhere, or come here late on game nights - visiting teams will often stop by after the game is over.
4	Mojo Yogurt is a great place to hang out and enjoy a cup of frozen yogurt.  It is well priced and has many different flavors to choose from.  You can also sample any and all of the different flavors before you decide which one to indulge yourself in.  There are many different toppings to choose from.  The customer service was very good.  They were friendly and helpful.  It was very clean and a good environment.  It is a great location in Tempe Marketplace with seating outside and inside.  The outdoor seating had cushioned chairs and a fireplace.  It was very relaxing. I would recommend it for all ages.
5	The Orange Table is awesome! I loved the experience, from the location tucked away in the Scottsdale Mall, to the eclectic decor, to the cuisine and service. I walked up on a Saturday around 10AM, and was seated right away in a corner with drinks served promptly. The menu consists of Pancakes, Omelets, Hash brown-type entrees, and sandwiches. Everything was expertly cooked and I really enjoyed my Lemonade. Not too sugary, and not too Lemony. I'll definitely be back ASAP. This is my new pick for my favorite breakfast spot, and next trip will be to try to lunch menu.
3	Average food, awesome alcohol.  I think my experience here is why I have yet to even attempt the food at bar/restaurant fixtures like Loco Patron or Salty Seniorita.  Maybe Cien Agaves tries to shoot for the restaurant aspect a little more - they might have to with their lack of a patio to rival their competitors.  \n\nOne thing I've noticed about this place is that it's usually dead except on Taco Tuesday.  There's something charming about eating shredded beef tacos and drinking cans of $2 Tecate with a bunch of affluent white people.  That being said, for a buck the tacos aren't bad and there's live music sometimes which I'm a huge sucker for.\n\nThe margaritas are good and strong, which is another of my weak points.  If you don't have to work the next day, I'd also recommend the Tequila Flight, which is $18 for three shots of really good tequila.  Speaking of tequila, they have over 100 kinds!  The only place I've seen come close is El Zocalo in Chandler but I don't think they hit that and they certainly don't have an entire page of a menu devoted to the delicious, cactusy drink.\n\nSkip the food, hit the tequila, and don't plan on making a night out of it because it's often dead.
4	I haven't been here in years until a few weeks ago for a girls happy hour.  I guess I always forget about this place because of the location?  I always pass by it on the way to Fashion Square tho!  :)  I will have to put it back on our rotation because it was good!  The interior is very modern, but the bar area has comfy half booths, and a large inviting, curved bar.  TYhis is an older restaurant, but you could never tell.  It is definitely a quieter, older crowd here (Gainey Ranch) and I like it.  It's probably the most mellow Fox Restaurant Concept. \n\nWe sat in the bar area for the HR specials. \nDrinks are top notch!  and strooong.  I like how they offer frou frou drinks WITH top shelf alcohols on their HR menu NICE!\n\nWe ordered the Asian salad which was very tasty....so tasty we ordered a 2nd one! \n\nThe calamari was good and it was served on top of a bitter salad\n\nThe 'loaded' potato skins were delicious...they used fingerling potatoes...very pretty presentation!\n\nThey also have a mac n cheese, which I'm sure we will try next time.  Next time I will be back for dinner!
4	Stayed a night here on a recent stay-cation.  Got a pretty good deal and when we checked in we got a free upgrade - score!  We got a suite which had a pull out sofa, chair, tv and desk.  It also had a kitchen area with a sink, fridge and microwave.  The bed was super comfy and the pillows were even marked with which were firm and which were soft.  We really liked that.  You can see the fountain from the hotel, which also has a pool.  Can't go wrong with staying here!
4	Went back for dinner the other night and I am glad to say that I still love this place.  \n\nThe roasted chicken is really good.  That sauce is fabulous! It's crispy on the outside, juicy and tender chicken, yummy broccolini. The farro is a little out of place, but who cares! It is THAT GOOD!   \n\nAlso had the romaine hearts salad with endive, bacon, apples. This will be another lunch visit for sure.  Has just the right amount of sweet, savory, creaminess and crunch. The apples are cut up very nicely as slices and julienned in the salad. The full portion fed 3 of us a small salad.\n\nWe also tried the pot roast which was very rich and decadent, almost like a short rib. It came on a creamy polenta which made it even more rich. It also has a few bok choy on the side as well. I love bok choy :) Overall good, but I'm glad we ordered a bunch of things and shared, because, it was a little heavy to eat all by yourself.  Everything doesn't compete with the chicken though. \n\nAnd 3rd, we got our stand by the french onion burger, which was good as usual. \n\nI also love the blackboard near  the back door that has the list of their seasonal fruits, vegetables, herbs that they use in their dishes.\n\nIf you eat here for dinner trust me, you have got to order the Chicken!
1	"""My husband and I visited Xooro on Sunday(10/24) and were extremely disappointed. The shop was pretty much empty with a couple in front of us. I ordered a plain churro filled with Nutella. The whole waiting/ordering process took about 5-10 minutes. \n\nAs for the churro, it was surreal. The churro tasted like it was 2+ days old- so I cannot give an honest description of the sugar/cinnamon and Nutella combinations because the taste of \old\"""" was overwhelming. My parents are Mexican and I grew up eating churros- they are so simple to make... With this in mind, it was surreal a new restaurant, within the first week, was serving an old churro that was reheated in a microwave under the toppings bar area. \n\nThe shop looks very incomplete.The LCD TV menu is on the far left of the ordering area; which you would think should be mounted on the right side to give customers a clear view of the menu. Overall does not feel comfortable. \n\nThe staff seems incomplete as well. For this past Sunday being their 5th day in business, I was expecting a full staff on duty ready to make fresh churros. There was one employee working who had to exit the shop to get a pen from someone outside in order for the couple in front of us to sign the receipt :/ \n\nOverall, the operations seemed to be out of a training video demonstrating how NOT to operate in the food business. I am surprised someone has sufficient capital to do this bad and not worry in this kind of economy. I hope they turn around quick... We in North Phoenix are in dire need of some spice in our dining options."""""""
4	I had lunch here two days ago, having never stepped foot in a Turkish restaurant before in my life. I'm an adventurous diner. Per my standard, I skipped the menu and ask the very friendly waitress/hostess to make a recommendation. \n\nShe suggested the Iskender Donner, as it is their signature dish. I order the lunch portion and was quite pleased. Lots of great flavor. The sauces were excellent. Nothing at all to complain about. Even the turkish coffee she suggested was nice -- and I'm not much of a coffee drinker!\n\nHigh marks. I'm really looking forward to returning some evening when the hookas are blazing.
3	"""I have heard about Jimmy John's since they opened in Phoenix recently.  I finally stopped in for lunch one day.  It was kind of busy.  There were a lot of people standing around waiting for food and all the tables were taken.  There is absolutely no where to stand and wait for food without being in someone's way.  They need a better system!\n\nAnd then as you are standing around, you can not even understand the person who is yelling out which sandwich is ready to be picked up.  us customers kept looking at each others saying, \what'd he say?\""""  \""""Is that yours or mine?\""""\n\nI couldn't believe I spent $8 for just a basic sandwich, a pickle, and a bottle of water.  Seemed a bit much if you ask me.  (Although I did like that they sold big pickles!  Yum!)\n\nIt was a good sandwich, but a little expensive for a basic lunch sandwich.  Hell, even $4 would have been too much in my opinion.\nIt was good, but I'm not rushing back anytime soon to spend $10 on a sandwich for lunch."""""""
3	Only been here once, a Thursday night.  It was very busy (usually a good sign) and we waited 15 min for a table.  Had good chips/salsa, took a few minutes to get our drinks, then once we ordered food was out in maybe 15 minutes at the most.  I have chicken tacos, they were good.  I wasn't blown away by anything, but everything was solid.  I will definitely be going back, and would be willing to amend my review to 4 stars if they have a few spectacular items.
4	One of the best places for hippie food in the Phoenix area.  Its not 100% authentic Mediterranean but its still good.  The prices are less than fine dining but the experience and food feels like a fine dining place.  However they give generous portions and I could have easily given them 5 stars if Haji Baba's Chicken Swarma wasn't twice as good as Pita Jungle's :)\n\nThis place seems to be constantly improving their menu and is a must go to for a date or just to try it out with some friends.
4	First time coming today after reading their reviews.  I had the Philly Cheese Steak Burger, and it did not disappoint.  Decent sized patty covered with thin slices of steak, peppers, onions, and a gooey slice of cheese melted on top and all inside a toasty bun...DELISH!!  Also ordered a side of fried zucchini, which I thought was really good, but a little on the greasy side.  If you like a good greasy burger, then this may be your place.  The decor isn't very fancy, but they have a huge soda selection, and several different burger choices.
2	"""I like the sushi here but the extra fee for \take out\"""" order.  Give me a break.  Your going to charge me a fee to order over the phone and come pick it up myself?  Am I paying for the styrofoam container?  Look at it this way, I'm not using your tables, Im not using your waitresses, your A/C, your bathrooms and you don't have to hire a bus boy and dishwasher to clean up after me.  I think I'm saving you money by getting \""""takeout\"""" dummies.  The family and i used to go here quite often but ever since I got the \""""take out\"""" fee I will be spending my money elsewhere.  Too bad because we liked this place and its very close to where I live."""""""
4	"""Went on a Saturday night and there wasn't a teen in sight...well behind the register only. Nice, clean atmosphere and I loved the hi-def TVs on the wall. We finished watching the game while enjoying our treat. Also the roll up \garage door\"""" mentioned by another reviewer is def a plus!  Imagine enjoying a Zoyo on a sunny day with the door open. Pretty sweet!  \n\nFor those us us always watching our calories, carbs or whatever, rest assured there are non-fat sugar fee options. Mine was only 70 calories per serving!  E N J O Y!"""""""
4	This was good. Really good. Not quote 5 stars, but really good. I ordered the special, which was pork Saltimboca. It was declious. Full of of flavor, and plentiful. I wasn't horribly impressed with the pasta that came on the side - pretty run of the mill boxed pasta. The pork was mostly very tender, but had a few tough/dry pieces. The delicious flavor made up for the few pieces of dry pork though. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Fettucine alfredo, and it was really good. There was plenty of sauce on the pasta, and I helped sop up the left over alfredo at the end with the garlic bread we ordered. The garlic bread was overcooked and burned, which is one of my pet peeves. \n\nThe price was reasonable. I would go back, but I wouldn't consider it to be the best value in town.
4	12-23-10\n\nWe met a friend for dinner at Tommy Bahamas in Kierland but it was too crowded to get seated so we walked across the street to the Ocean Club.\nThe place had a very nice feel to it but was also packed.  We found a table and enjoyed their excellent wine list until my husband got hungry and we decided to stay for dinner.\n\nAbout the food:  We started with a Caesar salad and split a petite filet mignon.  The salad was very good and the steak was moist and tender and well-marinated.  We were very pleased with everything, including the California Pinot Noir.  Not to mention, the ladies room has an attendant, which is a nice touch.\n\nWe highly recommend the Ocean Club at Kierland.
4	I'm a total yoga noob, attending my first class about a year and a half ago. I viewed it as a great workout and break from my more typical training, involving mostly lifting a lot of heavy shit (i.e. weights) and some running. While I enjoyed it, nothing really resonated with me at the time. Spending the last year or so doing some pretty intense self reflection and major work on staying 'present' when faced with...well, life I guess, I decided it was time to bring yoga back into my world. \n\nEnter Urban Yoga. \n\nThe location is perfect, (within walking distance from my building) the space is gorgeous and has a very calming feel to it. The staff seem to be genuine and all very helpful, and each class I've attended has felt incredibly comfortable, even for a fairly reserved person such as myself.  \nThe only time I felt uncomfortable was last night when I attended my first Ashtanga class. Actually, uncomfortable is an understatement. \n\nPrior to this I had only experienced the Urban Flow class and Core Vinyasa Flow. I immediately thought I was in over my head with all the Sanskrit Asana call outs, all with little to no explanation and I had a little bit of a panic attack moment. I'm dead serious when I say that I was just about to freak out, grab my mat and get the hell out of there when I accepted that my fear and feelings of inferiority were just that, mine. No one was laughing at the doofus in the corner all doe eyed and scared shitless. I took a deep breath (or many) and kept up the best I could. I'm glad I stayed because I left feeling great psychically and mentally and like I had taken a huge step to overcome an issue that has haunted me probably since birth, or at least chip away at a part of it. \n\nStudio Yoga is not cheap folks...anywhere, including Urban Yoga But the benefits I have personally received from continuing to make the effort to get up and go far outweigh the cost. Six months ago I would have walked right out of there and never come back out of feeling foolish and being embarrassed. Six months ago I would have been embarrassed to admit that I felt foolish and embarrassed. (sounds funny, but trust me, being that self aware is pure hell) Not yesterday. Not tomorrow either. I highly recommend Urban Yoga.
5	Had not stayed at Homewood before   Great value and an amazing place!   From the moment we were met at the front dest by Antionette and Debra, with more personality and smile than people should be allowed to have, to a great comfortable full service room, to a wonderful breakfast to a late checkout that we needed.......this was a great experience.   The two ladies made it even more special than the already great rooms.  We will look to homewood from now on.
5	This is my first review. I've been one to use yelp to help identify restaurants and services in cities I've visited. I figure it is time to contribute a bit back to the community.\n\nI live in the neighborhood and have lots of choices for coffee within a short walk. Royal is becoming my favorite because of quality of coffee, ambiance, and service. \n\nThe coffee roasted on premise is always a plus to me. The depth and nuance of the coffee flavors is always a enjoyable regardless of the technique used to make the coffee. \n\nThe space is small and seemingly ever changing with additions (and deletions) of seating, tables shelves and art. At first glance the space seems small and dark but In its own way the space feels comfortable. It is difficult to describe.   \n\nRoyal is staffed with helpful perky people who seem to offer a smile or nice word regardless of how busy it is. Royal can be slow if it is busy but the patrons are interesting to speak to and the place has a unhurried vibe. If you stop by in the afternoon or evening it is especially pleasant. \n\nIt is nice to have Royal in the neighborhood.
5	O-my-gosh!  Fantastic!  Had an amazing meal here tonight... \n\nWalked in and immediately noticed how cute and quaint this restaurant was. We were seated right next to the Ice Cave. We were able to watch the TV's in the bar area, making the crepes, which was very was cool. \n\nDecided on the Bergere crepe (vegetables aka ratatouille with goat cheese melted on top) and Roquefort crepe (melted blue cheese topped with caramelized apples and crumbled walnuts). As we were waiting, our friendly waiter brought us out Tartine to try. I'm not sure what was in it exactly.  Essentially it was bread with cheese on it, but it was delicious and we scarfed it down. \n\nOur crepes came out very quickly. They were served with a small side salad. I can't tell you which one was my favorite because they were both awesome! \n\nOnto dessert... We ordered the chocolate with bananas. It was big enough to share. It tasted like a bit of coffee was in the chocolate, which I love! \n\nSince we had the Groupon deal, our meal was very inexpensive. The service was fantastic. Kyle, the Sous Chef, even came out and spoke to us...asking us what our favorite crepe was, what we would like to see in future crepes, what's inside certain crepes, etc. He mentioned most of the crepes are gluten free. \n\nEverything was fresh and fantastic. I can't give enough praise for this restaurant. I can't wait to go back and take every one of my friends with me!
5	This is where to get tacos.  \n\nYou already got a taco store?   Leave them.   Forget about your current taco store.   \n\nDoes your taco store have bullets embedded in the interior walls?   No?   Well Taco Feliz does!      That's how you know you're going to get awesome tacos.     \n\nThe food here is double badass,    the salsa bar rocks your face,   and Taco Feliz is superior to your current taco dealer by no less than 4000%.   Recalibrate your brain on that.      \n\nThese are the tacos you want to cram inside you.
4	I came here for Happy Hour on a Wednesday after a long day to watch a Suns game with a friend and had a nice relaxing time. I love that they have Kona beers, especially because not many places have the Koko brown on tap which is just too delicious to not try if you're a fan of coconut and beer. I also had an order of Tofu tacos that were perfect for a light meal and not lacking on taste. I'll definitely be back since it's in the neighborhood!
5	In my never-ending quest for knowledge I took a Cider & Cheese Pairing Class tonight.  I think it was graduate level (?) not a Frosh in sight!\n\nUm. YUM.  The guy from Crispin was there to educate us on their offerings (gluten free for you celiacs in the crowd).  Interesting tidbits of information and a nice progression of flavors.  VERY FUN.\n\nThe cheese?  What can I say? Goat, Cow & Sheep.  All good in their own special way.  Soft stuff.  Stuff with rinds.  Stuff that smelled very good and stuff that just flat out smelled.  All tasty!  \n\nThis place sends out fun little email newsletters on a regular basis, sign up and you too will learn about CLASSES you can take!\n\nStep Away from the Valveeta & Can of Chili.  STOP HERE before you have people over to the house.  Impress them with fresh cheeses, olives, capers, wine, cider, beer, crackers.
5	So far I've had the Chipotle Egg Burrito and the Huevos n' Chorizo. Both were phenomenal and had everything I love in a breakfast meal. Simple ingredients with a good amount of spice and served piping hot. Portions are on the larger size, especially for the burrito. I enjoyed that it came with a side salad, it irrationally made me feel better about eating such a loaded burrito so early in the morning. During both my visits this place was moderately packed but the line moved quick and my friends and I never had a hard time finding a table. Also, their Bloody Mary's are only $5.
3	Do you enjoy non healthy treats! this is your place. I stop at this place in a random day, and decided to try it. \n\nFriendly service made me stay longer and finally decided what to try. A oatmeal chocolate chip with meant and chocolate ice cream.  The cookie tastes ok (not the mos complicated recipe I guess). Ice cream...it is really home made...not italian style for my taste buds, but still ok. \n\nI had only half a cookie and it was MORE than enough!. For a society that can't taste glucose at 10%, this treat will surpass your sugary expectations ;)
5	I usually never write review unless I really really like a place. Well today I stopped by this dairy queen because I heard they had a good deal were you buy one blizzard and get a second for 99 cents too good to pass!! When I got here there was almost a line out the door. But much to my surprise the place looked really clean and the line moved really fast. When I reached the counter the lady was really nice she took the time to ask me how my day was and she even apologized for the wait you dont find many places that do that . Mind you I probably only waited under 5min which was not bad at all. I really like the fact that this dairy queen actually gives you the right amount of candy in blizzards too because I have been to a couple and there is probably only a few pieces of candy. Overall the staff was extremely nice and the service is fast. I really liked the fact that it was clean even if they were busy. I will come back again.
4	I gotta say that I really love Cityscape so far. About six mos ago, I joined the Gold's Gym and have really looked forward to the eventual openings of restaurants and shops. It is gradually turning into something great. Right now, you've got a CVS, Urban Outfitters, 3-4 more clothing shops (men and women), Lucky Strikes, an art gallery, and a few eateries (5 Guys, Vitamin T) with more to come. Some of the retail shops are pricy and some are very reasonable. Sure one or two of the retail shops are chains, but what city shopping strip doesn't have chains mixed in with small businesses? The parking garage also validates which is nice. There is also a light rail stop just outside. \n\nI have been to a couple of festivals at Cityscape including Oktoberfest and also visited the ice skating rink last night. While you have the typical negative comments about the ice skating rink (This isn't Rockerfeller Square, It only fits 10 skaters), I thought it was nice, different, and had a good 30-40 skaters on it. $10/person includes skate rental and unlimited time. Bottom line, Cityscape has room for improvement but I love what it is so far, and think it is a great addition to downtown. I can't wait till the other eateries and retail shops begin popping in.
3	Its a pretty nondescript dive.  Its basically a hallway, which makes its kind of neat... and there is a big fish tank with weirdly cool fish to stare at.  Otherwise its your typical dive bar atmosphere.  They do have 'fish tank specials' which means that about 10 bottles are lined up in front of the fishies and they are marked pretty cheaply (naturally the price is written in Sharpie on the bottle).  \n\nI wanted to try the 'chocolate vodka' so I basically got a really full glass of straight vodka for $2.50.  Odd drink but lots of alcohol quite inexpensively.  The bartender had to have been high on something.  No complaints though... she was hilarious just to watch.  \n\nI would definitely go back on any dive bar crawl.  - also try Darwins just two doors down!
3	Again, it's a bit unfair of me to rate this restaurant because I'm from San Jose/Cupertino but I'm gonna do it anyway.\n\nSo, being from San Jose/Cupertino, I've had me some good Chinese food and even better dim sum. So when the Boyfriend brought me here, I was expecting something decent, but not anything too authentic.\n\nThis place was fairly decent and authentic! It has the Asian ladies and their dim sum carts. It has the OG dim sum dishes. It even has the authentic less than mediocre Asian service. \n\nThe only disappointment is that this place is a bit dirty and ragged-y looking. And the vegetable dishes are minimal. In fact, I had to order a veg dish off the menu because they didn't have any dim sum veg dishes and it cost $13! Bleh.
2	"""Lunch service only. \n\nI swear my fellow diners at hospital canteens look in better shape than the  mass that \meats\""""  for late lunch at this location. This wasn't just a grey tide but a few human buoys had popped in too.   Please withhold the \"""" don't be so judgmental\""""  holier than though attitude , this is a review site  after all.   \n\nLately I have been working remotely ( or remotely working)  on the Friday so I've been going out on Fridays for lunch since it's all \""""new\"""" to me.  The same places that I eat out at  in the evening often have vastly different characters during the day and  this Black Angus throws it into sharp relief.  For example at night I have never been served stale bread. \n\nAt night they have  a wide range of ages , group sizes and noise levels  and  there's some life in the place. Chilis that just opened up nearby and seems to have kidnapped the life leaving   a quiet, genteel even , location that would be more fitting in the deep south when you don't have anything better to do. So far this is the only local place that  exceeded my hour. \n\nFood's ok ,  fitting with the  price range and  the burgers are well appointed,   cooked to request and  relatively  tasteful.  Fries tepid and it feels like the minimum  you have to do to keep the blue rinse and  Caddy driving class happy is all they are about when the sun is up.  The only thing hip about this place is the replacement joints.  \n\nCoffee seems to have been held on life support  and brought out when some unsuspecting fool that refuses to believe in coffee only being  a morning drug. Usually the surroundings  don't bug me but it felt like the Hometown Buffet  , which I can live with until you give me stale bread  past it's sell by date which  I fear may a fitting epitaph for this place within daylight hours"""""""
2	"""HIT AND MISS. MOSTLY MISS. GO FOR THE TUNA STARTER AND ORDER A DOUBLE PORTION; REAL HIT!\n\nTHE FOOD\n-- tuna sashimi dish is great value, great flavors. order it.\n-- coconut rum with watermelon liqueur a winner, if only the bartender would remember to add the fruit. do you need a recipe book?\n-- hash with eggs arrives eggs-over-hard despite my instructions for easy\n-- toasted english muffin slathered with butter, but not toasted.\n-- chicken salad's chicken was bland except for the rub on the edge. boo.\n-- taco plate features raw, unprepared corn tortillas. yeah, i can pull one from the bag and dump something in it too! why would i pay for that?\n-- salsa too salty\n-- cole slaw just not interesting, ends up a plate filler. blech.\n\nTHE DECOR\n-- hip sealed concrete, bulk tiki statues everywhere, and faux Eames chairs complete the hip look, framed by Green-Apple table shades and roll-up garage-door walls.\n-- designers kept the awesome hexagon street-facing window and high ceilings in the bar area. kudos.\n\nTHE REST\n-- starting to develop a pet peeve for \sauces\"""" delivered via ketchup squirter bottle atop my item or side dish.

BOO. be ready for 30-minute wait in summer when no one's sitting outside."""""""
5	So, I had been here before, for all of about 10 minutes and wasn't able to sample any food or beverage. On Thursday last week I was able to get the full experience. \n\nI was taken here on a date. That's right, someone took ME here. That was a nice change of pace. We got there around 8 on a Thursday night and the place wasn't too busy. we sat inside right next to the roll up doors. The place used to be a firehouse. So there was perfect weather. We started the meal with drinks. She ordered a bottle of Sauv White. I finally got to try an Argentinian Malbec, full bodied(well that is what the waiter told me). The malbec was very good. I tried some of the Sauv, it was very tasty also. I usually don't like whites, but it wasn't too dry. We shared a small bowl of marinated olives. Kalamata and Green olives, very good. I ate most of it. For the main course I had the Salami & Manchego panini with pesto. OMG!!! This thing was awesome! Very toasty and buttery. I had half of it with a salad. The salad was simple greens with flaky tuna. Now, this could have been canned tuna and anyone who knows me, knows I hate this with every ounce of my being. With that being said, the salad was excellent. The tuna was marinated in vinegar and capers and took away a lot of the nastiness. It had a simple balsamic vinaigrette on it. I was very impressed with the food and ate every bit on my plate. For dessert we split a flourless chocolate souffle. It had a very large, ripe strawberry on top and a huge dollop of fresh whip cream. If you like chocolate, get this and you won't be disappointed. \n\nWe finished up the food and headed to the patio. The patio is cozy with several fire pits and lots of seating. This would be a great patio for a day drink or to unwind at night. I have always wanted to try mate,pronounced Maw-tay (thanks Z), a traditional South American tea. It was very good, but on first taste reminded me of a cigar. Ask them for honey and put it in. Very good. They bring out a thermos type thing of hot water so you can just keep refilling. I highly recommend it. \n\nThis is a little gem in the heart of Sunnyslope. Great patio, very warm interior, great service, and great food. The food menu is small, but I bet everything is done to perfection. Large, interesting wine list for the wine aficionados out there.  I love when little local places blow me away.
5	I finally spent the night at the Phoenix Downtown Sheraton.  It is a beautiful hotel.  Previously, my husband and I have attended several Black Tie Events (John C. Lincoln Health Foundation Night of Gold) in its massive ballroom.  It is a wonderful venue for a charity event.  But my only true hotel experiences were the ballroom, common areas, the gorgeous lobby and bar.  I felt that before I could really review a hotel property, I had to sleep there.  \n\nLady Gaga recently came to Phoenix to strut her stuff. A few of us decided we had to see this and needed a home base close to US Airways Arena.  A 30th floor 2-bedroom suite at the Downtown Phoenix Sheraton perfectly fit the bill.  With 4 of us spending the night a few friends joined us as we primped and partied in anticipation of seeing Mama Monster.  Everything about the Sheraton was seamless.  Parking valet, check in, and bellman were very efficient.  The room was WOW! There were two bedrooms, each connecting to a common living room with a view of downtown Phoenix and South Mountain beyond.  We were able to watch all of the concert activity around US Airways from our windows!   \n\nFurnishings are new and tasteful in a very clean simple way.  Contemporary prints of cacti decorate the walls. Bathrooms are large and stocked with nice toiletries.  The beds are WONDERFUL with white down comforters and lots of fluffy pillows.  Flat screen TVs, large work desks, bar in living room, cordless telephones, black out drapes (very important after a gaga night!) and even an efficient video check out.\n\nI will return again to the Downtown Sheraton and would highly recommend it to anyone traveling on business or enjoying an evening in the Phoenix downtown area.
5	Plaza de Anaya is a family for local belly dancers.  Its ran by two of the greatest ladies Kim and Tiff, who support the local dancers and put on great shows to showcase local dancers. You couldn't ask for a better place to learn to dance they keep it exciting and new with the different classes they offer. There is always a chance to learn the basics of belly dance, cabaret belly dance, tribal belly dance, ATS, hip hop, Polynesian, Bollywood, Poi, Fire Arts, Skirt, Sword the list can go on. I highly recommend checking out the studio.  I would also suggest stopping in just to shop not only do they have some of the best belly dance wear out there, the jewelry case is  brimming with pretties that everyone can wear.
2	"""This place used to be a favorite.  The food is very good but the portions are rather small for the price.  I'm all about presentation but don't comprise the size of the meal so much just to make it pretty.  Their lobster pot pie used to be huge and look like an actual pot pie with tons of veggies and lobster but the \updated\"""" version is a quarter of the size and looks nothing like a pot pie.  It is simply a piece of lobster tail with a tiny pastry puff on top and no more than ten pea size carrots and potatoes, for 40 bucks!! Don't get me wrong, It is a great spot and the food is delicious but I think they need to increase portion size or lower their prices a little."""""""
5	Nothing short of amazing. I was impressed with the atmosphere from the second I walked it with the love music. When I heard about the Pomegranate Guacamole, my first thought was another booshie spin on a classic Mexican dish. Needless to say I was blown away. They had an amazing selection of tequila and drinks I order a Victoria even thou it wasn't on the menu. Considering it just became available in Phoenix this year I understood.  For my main course I choose Tacos de Cochinita Pibil. Normally I am left still hungry when ordering a taco platter this is not the case with these small tacos stuff with all this with wonderful ingredients fresh and flavorful. Great service, great food and great ambiance have made Barrio Cafe my new weekly must go place!
5	Oh PastaBAR - how I do love thee!\n\nI had a marvelous pre-theatre dinner at PastaBAR last Saturday evening, and I wish I could beam myself there right now and relive the meal.\n\nWe started with drinks. Go for their daily infusions. I had strawberry, and it was delicious. \n\nNext, we shared their version of a caprese salad: Buffalo Mozzarella, basil pesto, heirloom tomatoes, anchovies. The mozzarella melts in your mouth!\n\nFor my entree, I had the Chitarra alla Amatriciana...guanciale, onion, parsley, hot pepper, tomato ... Yum! \n\nIf you're in the downtown Phoenix area, please take advantage of this local gem!
3	I met a girlfriend for brunch on Saturday morning at Bacon. The restaurant is open and airy inside with a cute little bar. I sat at the bar since almost every table was occupied when I arrived around 11 am. The bartender, Mary Ann, was such a sweetheart and we chatted quite a bit while I waited on my friend.\n\nMy friend and I both had a mimosa (seriously it's not brunch without one!) which was almost $9 each. Now granted you do get a little bottle Korbel so basically you are getting two mimosas for the price of 1, but with other Valley restaurants offering $1-3 mimosas at brunch, I thought Bacon was overpriced. It took us some time to decide what to eat since there were so many delicious sounding choices on the menu. My friend decided on the three egg breakfast, while I decided to try the breakfast burrito. I wish the food had lived up to how delicious it sounded on the menu. My burrito was average and I wish the bacon in the burrito had been cooked a bit more, but the real killer was the potatoes. I love breakfast potatoes, but these were a real dud. They weren't even cooked all the way and were too greasy for my taste.\n\nFor our two mimosas and two entrees, our bill came to $35. For the price, I was just not impressed with the quality. While I will give Bacon a second try, I will not be racing back since there are better brunch options in the Valley.
5	"""Terrific place, great decor, huge flat screen tv's encouraging you to eat eat. I stood in line and decided on a soup, sandwich combo. I said I would like to try the \such and such\"""" soup. To which the attendant promptly gave me a sample in a little cup after having asked if I have peanut allergies. The sandwich seemed a bit small but the bread made it worth all the while and heavy to prove to be just enough to satisfy my wolf-like-appetite that I can have. All in all what a great joint, can't wait for the weather to cool down so I can spend a mindless afternoon on the patio."""""""
1	This is one of my neighborhood restaurants, although I've only eaten in once. My coworker usually gets to-go for the office. I've had their fries and salads; I've found the fries overly salted and the salads overly dressed. I recently had brunch in the restaurant finally; I got the special, which was two eggs any style over country gravy and biscuits. The biscuits were like pucks -- nothing fluffy or buttery about them. They broke off in unsavory chunks, and on top of that, had arrived barely warm. The gravy was runny and wasn't particularly special; in fact I'll admit it looked a bit gross because it had chunks of chicken meat in it. I would say it looked a bit like runny chicken vomit. The potatoes and eggs were really the only things that looked appetizing on the whole plate and what I ended up eating the most.
3	"""I very much wish I could give the gorgeously remodeled Vig more than 3 stars, but the inconsistency in food and service has knocked off a star for the time being.  \n\nAesthetically, the Uptown Vig is just lovely.  The renovation of the space was done with class, and the differing textures on every wall/surface/decor really made things pop.  I'm loving the re-purposing trend in central Phoenix... what great use of an old, seemingly useless space. \n\nOn my first visit to the Uptown Vig, I came with the girlfriends for Happy Hour.  We love to check out all of the greatest happy hours around town, and were particularly excited for half-priced appetizers.  We had the traditional hot \vings\"""", guac and chips, trifecta (mini-burgers) and the flatbread pizza with tandori chicken.  All of the items were relatively good, however nothing really stood out or surprised us.  We were disappointed at our server's attitude.  She seemed immediately put off when we ordered only waters and 2 cokes (table of 4) with our food.  Come on - \""""real\"""" drinks aren't required, are they?  It was a school night!  Plus, I had to manage to drive myself home, and I totally can't manage that with even one drink.  I understand that we were reaping the benefits of the happy-hour pricing without shelling out for alcohol, but there is no need to be put off by our choice.  We ALWAYS tip enough to make up for their trouble... Anyways... I digress...  I also ordered the Good Korma curry dish to take home to the husband, after conferring with the waitress about good gluten-free options.  Unfortunately, when I arrived at home, I discovered that they had stuck a great, big piece of naan on top of the curry.  Gluten, gluten everywhere :(\n\nOur second visit was a great turnaround.  We had decided to go to Chelsea's Kitchen for Mother's Day Brunch.  Chelsea's turned out to be so packed that we couldn't even find a space to park.  Using our incredible genius, we decided that the fairly new Vig would probably have less of a crowd.  Boy, were we right!  We were seated right away, and there were many tables to spare.  I ordered the Achiote Salmon - oh my.  It was an incredible dish.  Such complexity of flavor in the spices and poblano sauce, and the accompanying chorizo-stuffed corn cake was delish.  Definitely something to return for.  The husband ordered chilequiles, and thought they were good, but not nearly as great as Gallo Blanco's version.  Both of our mothers ordered the Persian Kebabs, and both seemed pleased, but not completely bowled over.   The child ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, which was entirely too much bread and not quite enough cheese.  I did enjoy stealing his French fries, however - yum!\n\nSince the new Vig is just around the corner from my house, has a super happy hour, and the amazing salmon dish, I'm sure I will be back.  Hopefully the service loses the slightly I'm-better-than-you attitude, and adopts a truly friendly vibe.  Looking forward to that!"""""""
2	Went there for an early dinner today.  I had a baja steak burrito and my daughter had steak nachos, along with two diet cokes.  My burrito was ok.  Megan's nachos were ok.  Neither one was anything special.   The salsa bar was a mess.  They say there are no tomatoes, so all the salsa they had was the green stuff and something else that was black and didn't taste very good.  There were no limes in the salsa bar, and I love limes, so told them.  I was almost done with my meal by the time they finally got them out.  Garbage was completely full, almost spilled stuff on the ground when I was trying to put my stuff away.  Tables were a mess.  But the employees had time to play grabass in the back.  I had a groupon, so got a good deal.  I won't be going back.  I like Fili Bs much better.
5	"""Woah, this place is great!  On my first visit I walked in and was immediately greeted by 4 different \hello\""""'s, \""""welcome\""""'s, and smiling faces.  What a warm welcome right off the bat.\n\nIt was a little hard to find, but once you find it, you will be so glad you did.  Their food is amazing!  I have been twice now and have had their pork chops, hot links, and chicken wings, all were perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and tasted excellent!  I was a bit hesitant with the hot links, as often they come way too greasy for my taste, but these were grilled to perfection and not overly greasy.  I was very impressed.  I have also tried their dirty rice (spicy and dirty with ground beef, great!), black eyed peas, and their french fries.  The fries were just fries, but seasoned well.... everything else was spot on.  I really enjoyed their dirty rice.  I've had a lot of different types of dirty rice, and this was very unique and very tasty.\n\nTheir chicken deserves its own paragraph here.  Seriously.  I order their fried chicken \""""not battered\"""", so they basically season the chicken and drop it in the deep fryer.  OMFG.  I've eaten my share of fried chicken, but their chicken, by far, is better than anything I have ever eaten..... easy.  In fact, my mouth is literally watering as I type this.  Go, eat their chicken. \n\nThe environment was nice... low light, dark decor, great old school tunes being spun by a dj on the 1's and 2's. \n\nDon't worry, if you don't eat wheat or gluten, just tell them and they will make sure your meal is made without, no issues here.  Very accommodating."""""""
4	I generally dread going to the Depot. It is hard to find help, they are all set up differently, I can never find the bathroom, and I always seem to need the bathroom when I am there. Probably because I am there for so long. On time I was there for over 2 hours. Don't ask.\n\nAnyway, this Home Depot is newer and therefore is still clean and not that busy yet. Service is not always what it should be, but it has been better than other Home Depots.\n\nOn one of my endless visits since I bought the money pit, I was buying one extra piece of Easyboard (drywall you can hang tile on). As I walked through the store I felt like a lot of creepy guys were looking at me. Now this is not all that unusual in a hardware store if you are a female with all your teeth and 2 boobs, but it seemed creepier this day. \n\nWell I checked out and went to my car, only to realize the Easyboard was not going to fit into my car. So I simply went back in and asked a Home Depot  guy by the door if he could cut the piece in half, which he did gladly. Then as I was walking across the parking lot to my car I heard someone calling Mam, Mam. I realized he was calling me since I was the only female in sight, and when I turned around it was the guy who cut my board. To my horror he then asked me if I knew the back of my pants had a hole ripped in them. Needless to say, I did not know that. \n\nBasically I had a large L shaped tear in my pants right on my butt, and I was walking around Home Depot with a nice portion of my ass cheek showing. This probably explains all the stares I got. How did I not notice you ask? I was wondering the same thing! I then thanked him and walked the rest of the way to my car with the Easyboard covering my butt.\n\nI guess the moral of this story is I did have somebody who works at Home Depot go the extra mile to help me out for once! I was not done running errands, so he definitely saved me from further humiliation. Although next time I went in there, he felt the need to mention that he remembered I was the lady with the hole in the back of my pants. I guess I just wasn't ready to laugh about it 3 days later.
5	"""Thank goodness there's no shortage of Irish pubs in Phoenix. Rosie's is certainly one of the best in the Valley. The bar is warm and inviting.  The staff is friendly. And there's a lot of return customers, giving the bar that \Cheers\""""-like vibe.\n\nStella, Smithwick's, Guinness -- you'll find all of the old faves here. So the next time you're looking to get in touch with your Irish side, stop in and say hi. Chances are, you'll see Miss Rosie behind the bar."""""""
5	Every time I drive by Phoenix,  I try to stop by and get me some Streets of New York pizza.  Love me some of that.  So  good.  I wish there was one in LA and I wish there was one in El Paso.  \n\nI could just see it now.  Get a few pitchers of beer, have some of their bangin wings and finish it off with a large pizza (pepperoni & sundried tomatoes and extra sauce please).  Then again, I'd probably be 400 lbs.  by now if it was here.\n\nI wonder what their other food items are like?  I've had their pasta once too.  I dont remember what it was, maybe some sort of alfredo,  I just remember really liking that as well.  \n\nI'm  not sure what it is, that I love about their pizza.  I think it's just a good combination of bread sauce and cheese.  Maybe,  it's part of my psychosis where when I first lived in Phoenix,  I was generally too poor to eat there often so it became this sort of luxury and a symbol of success every time I eat it.\n\nIt can't be that bad.  There's a shit load of them now since I've returned to phoenix.  Before, I only knew about only one or two.  I hope they haven't gotten so big that they have to cut corners on their recipes to keep up on the profits.  That would suck and I think a lot of franchises yield to that practice and just get shittier through the years.  \nWell, the last time I had it was over xmas break and it was still bangin so keep it up, Streets of New York.  You'll be seeing me again next road trip home.
5	As soon as I walked in I was in love. This bar made me feel like I was back home, with all of the original wood work and the smell of an old house. That may not be a draw for all but I miss the feeling of experiencing something historical; that is hard to find in Phoenix. The bar staff were chatty and friendly, food was good and the beer selection was pretty great, too.  I'll be going back again soon for the English breakfast and Bloody Mary Sunday
1	I'm not too familiar with driving around Tempe. I needed to buy more hair color and I was around in the area so I thought I'd try a local Sally's Beauty Supply. So I called this store to see what it was located by to help me find it. The lady who answered the phone told us it wasn't by Chase bank.... so I  drove all around Southern and Mclintock look at all of the Stores. I couldn't find it. So I decided to go by Chase anyways, there it was... I wasn't too impressed at this point, but I didn't let it bother me. I picked out my hair color and went to pay, and apparently the lady at my register didn't accept Visa's or my cosmetology license... She told me that no Sally's would take my Visa card? When I was at a different Sally's earlier that day (and many other days before) and purchased lots of products... She was so very rude. She makes me embarrassed to be a cosmetologist... I will stick to Cosmoprof if I'm in Tempe for now on...
5	"""I was looking to add some variety to my workout routine when Enamor offered a deal for Go Figure, so I grabbed it! I just returned from my first class, and was really, really happy with the workout I got!\n\nI had been hearing about barre classes- my friend in Tennessee has been raving about them, but haven't heard too much about them here in Phoenix. As Laurie B said in her review, it's a wonderful fusion of ballet, yoga, pilates. Not only does it give you a total body workout, but it's also low impact- which is great for runners like me with bad knees.\n\nKelly has a beautiful studio there. I was warmly greeted by Rachel at the front desk, who already had my internet deal set up and paperwork ready for me to fill out. Kelly was warming up in the studio and came out to greet me as well. They have lockers to store your stuff (for footwear, you only wear socks in the studio as the floor is carpeted) and the key is on a coil that fits conveniently around your water bottle! And as you're waiting, they have some really cute clothes for sale, as well as the gripper socks to help give you some traction on the floor. (I had regular socks on for the workout and didn't slip too much, but will probably pick up a pair of their socks next time around.)\n\nThe workout got started right on time, the class size was small, and it was just a perfect experience for my first time doing a barre class. Kelly was great at demonstrating the positions and movements. She came around and praised and corrected as needed. She provided variations on the exercises if they were too difficult. We got to use not only our own body weight, as well as the barre of course- but also hand weights, small balls, etc. Great choice of music throughout the hour-long workout-- it kept me motivated even if I was getting tired! \n\nThe length of each exercise brought me to the point of muscle fatigue but never was too much, and it was really nice to have moments of stretches interspersed throughout the workout. And the stretches at the end were a nice finale to the class.\n\nIf you're looking to try something new with your exercise routine, check out Go Figure! You'll definitely feel the difference, and I can't wait to SEE the difference after my next few classes!\n\nUPDATE (7-12-12):\nDid my 2nd class today, and I left feeling great! The class size was a little larger today (maybe 6 students), but the studio is big enough that we all had enough space to stretch and reach without bumping into one another. It also stayed cool despite more bodies.\n\nWith more students today, I was really impressed by the range in ages- probably 30's to 60's. It's really such a great workout that anyone can do it. Kelly provides variations on the exercises, so no one gets left behind despite their level of fitness- which I was grateful for as I needed to do knees-down push-ups today (still working on increasing upper body strength!).\n\nI also wanted to mention the great personal touches about Go Figure... The day after my first class, I got a personal handwritten note of thanks and encouragement from Kelly. That really meant a lot. And I am impressed with how Kelly remembers everyone's names. It's really nice to hear \Great form, Tracy!\"""" in class as I'm working hard!  :o) Also, I had mentioned a back issue I had to Kelly before the class, and she remembered during the class and had me add a block to the exercise so I could still do the exercise safely.\n\nFinally, as I left today, my body really did feel good-- my muscles were a little tired, but they were relaxed and did feel longer and stronger. I could totally get used to this!"""""""
4	This is by far my favorite place to get Chinese food.  When I order their take-out, the food arrives in under 30 minutes, and I've never had them mess up a single order. \nThe menu is pretty standard for the type of food that it is, but I personally find that most of the items are cooked with much more flavor than at some asian places.  The garlic green bean chicken and fried dumplings are two of my favorites, along with the rest of my family's.  I didn't expect much out of this place the first time around, but I was pleasantly surprised!
3	My family used to shop here, and we liked it. \n\nPhoenix has more different grocery stores per capita than any other place I have ever lived, it's amazing. There are a lot of choices.\n\nBut my dad, in particular, liked that there was an actual butcher to talk to when he wanted something special to put on the grill. \n\nAnd it was cool to grab a decent slice of pizza for lunch before or after shopping.\n\nNot a bad market, despite some of the bad press here.
3	Where do I even begin with Paradise Valley Mall?\n\nTo start, it's old. If you're expecting something chic and expensive, I'd try Kierland Commons, or Scottsdale Fashion Square. PV doesn't even come close to the par that those two reach, but in a sense, that's part of it's charm. \n\nLocation wise, it's bordered between Scottsdale and Phoenix, giving it two different consumer markets, which has provided the mall with a more diversified variety of stores. It's also at the cross roads of a major  intersection, and transit center, giving it a constant supply of business (In theory, that is.) \n\nMoving to the Valley in the early 2000's, I distinctively remember PV mall's walkable distance and fabulous accessibility to be it's strong points. Stores were flourishing, the movie theater was convenient, and it seemed like an all-around good place to hang out, see a movie, and do some casual shopping without being overwhelmed by a large atmosphere of crowds or getting lost in a huge maze of buildings. It's a good sized mall, and has easy parking, which many malls do not offer. \n\nHowever, as the years passed, PV mall has taken a walk of shame. Originating from the closure of the Harkins Theater, numerous other stores have closed, even the Taco Bell! I found that the selection of restaurants is depressing as a whole, and the food court is although very spacious, is exponentially loud and messy. (And more recently, Televisions screens spew out loud music from Vh1 to entertain the middle school kids who now dominate the food court.) \n\nNevertheless, I've grown up with PV mall. It's locale has served me nearly everyday, and the collection of strip malls surrounding Paradise Village Parkway is one of the more navigable array of stores there is. I have a repertoire of memories from this mall, and it's middle class environment is a happy median between Fashion Square and Metrocenter.\n\nBut PV mall, you seriously need to upgrade your selection of stores, and Costco won't save you from the same fate that's taken Christown.
4	"""I ate at FnB while visiting Scottsdale, largely based on the rave reviews of my fellow Yelpers. \n\nLoved the amazingly edited, flavorful, really interesting menu, which I'm sure changes really often. This so could have been 5 stars EXCEPT other than getting our order and rushing us out with the check, our service was pretty... Absent. Although shout out to the water boys who kept us hydrated. \n\nMy other beef is about the \B\"""" in the name. In my mind, there would be some expectation of real drink options based on the name alone. I'm usually a fan of BYO, but I thought the corkage fees (even for beer?) were inordinate and not keeping with the spirit of the place."""""""
4	Coworkers and I have always suspected this joint to be a front for some sort of illegal activity. There are always a couple flashy $100K vehicles in the parking lot and I never see this place full, even at lunch. The service here is always slow (maybe they're too busy breaking legs in the back room?) but you can munch on the dipping bread to tide you over until your meal arrives. Best not to complain or you might end up in the back room?\n\nThe food here is very good, I always enjoy the Lasagna, the sandwiches are good as well but certain ones can be a bit oily. The pasta salad side with the sandwiches is excellent.\n\nVery nice atmosphere and decor, the entire front opens up via stacking sliding glass doors. Excellent place to enjoy a fresh air lunch when the weather is nice.
5	So I finally took the plunge to change my insurance to AZ, so I decided I might as well take advantage of paying more by getting the mysterious scratch that ran along the entire driver's side of my car fixed.  I've had this exact same problem before (which makes me wonder if someone is after me), so I knew the protocol: call Geico, find a repair shop that's Geico-affiliated, get a rental.  My last experience dealing with this scratch business was really easy, and this time was no different.\n\nI'm not sure how Geico decides what repair shops to work with, but the checklist must go something like this: \n-Friendly employees - check.\n-Clean facilities - check.\n-Geico Adjuster on location to explain everything to you in layman's terms honestly - check.\n-Enterprise Rent-A-Car on location with a car ready and waiting - check.\n-Cute boys working at Enterprise - check.\n-Fastest turn-around time ever - check.\n-Great communication skills with phone calls and updates - check.\n-Free bottles of water - check.\n-Can provide a painless experience to the customer - check.\n\nNot to mention, when I got there, the adjuster looked over my car and thought I could get away with just getting it buffed so I wouldn't have to pay.  Even though that wasn't the case, it was nice that he tried to save me from paying my deductible.  So, long story short, if you need some repair work done on your vehicle, Gerber is the place to go.  They treat your car like a baby.  Perhaps that is why it is called Gerber.  Hm...
4	Top notch golf clubs featuring a Nick Faldo and Arnold Palmer course. Great practice/warmup facility. Well appointed pro shop and a decent steakhouse is next to the pro shop.\n\nThe courses are challenging with tough to hold greens. Beautiful fairways and lots of sand.\n\nThey have a built in GPS system on the carts which helps speed up play and the drink wagon is fully stocked with all kinds of drinks and good food.\n\nVital statistics: 118 bunkers on the Faldo course, so practice your sand game before showing up here. Pricey round of golf at $150. Not completely convinced they have the green fees right. If you decide to golf in July when it is 110 degrees you can play for $50.
4	We love going to the Arizona Biltmore, whether to eat or enjoy the patio off of the Wright Bar. The Frank Lloyd Wright design still blows me away with his detail. I don't know of too many lobbies that have a more beautiful seating area. \n\nThe hotel's new Hollywood and Wine Events was a great find for us. On specified weekends the hotel hosts either comedy or musical acts in one of their rooms. We went to the Comedy show last weekend and had an amazing time. $10 for the tickets (show lasted 2 hours) and the well drinks were only $5 (includes martinis). I was paying $19 at the Wright Bar just 100 yards away. Great comics and overall show. \n\nThe Biltmore is worth just visiting or spending a few days to enjoy the spa and golf. Glad we live right there to enjoy it year round.
1	Servers was rude and snotty; she rudely corrected the customer behind me when she called an item by the incorrect name and muttered other insults under breath thinking no one could hear. She was the only employee serving and cashiering and there was only one cook at 11:30 for the lunch rush? Some other employee spent her time walking back and forth ignoring the cook, the server and the line of customers. Skip this joint altogether! There is a Pei Wei at Grayhawk and another Panda at Desert Ridge.
3	Yeah, yeah it's Starbucks. Everyone knows it tastes like burning, yet we always go back for more. Typically I'd not even write a review for such a giant chain, but this location does have a unique vibe that sets it apart from the rest. The staff is psychotically cheerful, and ZIPPY ZOOMY FAST. They can work through a line of 10 people with speed and composure that could humble Speedy Gonzalez! Also, the vast patio is dreamy, and is always buzzing with eye candy. Score. The big downfall, however is the iced coffee. Weak. Like.. 85 year old woman who reuses her Sanka grounds kinda weak.. I've had this problem at other locations, but certainly not at all. Buh. Ambience, and experience, however, are how this transformed from a 2 star review to a 3 star review...
4	Oh beloved FEZ what is that secret sauce that you bring with those ever so scrumptious sweet potato fries...dusted so gently in cinnamon...mmmmm.  I love FEZ for a nice weekday lunch or a lazy happy hour.  The drinks are good and not overpriced.  The atmosphere is hip, but not pretentious and the staff is always spot on.  If you have not been here, it is a definite must.  They offer a good variety of entrees from healthy to hearty.  If you are a health nut, order one of their tasty salads and make your friends order the fries and just try one with the secret sauce, then go run a few miles, you will be fine.
2	"""We stayed here last week as our kids were participating in a Swim Meet next door at the High school. Breakfast was bad, eggs were cold and kinda burned, how can anyone burn an egg!! The double beds in the kids room, were in poor shape, they literally buckle up as you lay down. And here is the worst of all, the Meet was going to be over at noon which is check out time, when we asked the manager to do a late check out for just one hour so the kids can take showers before we head out to the Airport, the manager had a real bad attitude and said he will let us stay an extra hour if we pay for an additional half a day!!! To think of all the money the team spent at that place!!!\nDouble check your bill for accuracy, as they had by \mistake\"""" one night at a higher rate.\nThey get two stars for location to both High School and Downtown."""""""
3	"""This place is \okay.\""""  I had the mongolian beef. It was very tender which I like.  It was really cheap - like $5 or $6.  I got mostly rice and not enough meat though.  A bunch of us from work ordered here.  One woman got the orange chicken and took one bite and refused to eat the rest.  For the record I tried it and it wasn't that bad.  But she didn't like it.  Overall I would say this place is pretty average.  Nothing special that you'll crave but will fill your need for Chinese food if you are in the area."""""""
1	Yep Yelpers - I'm not ever going back here again. \n\nI asked the girl at the counter if they had Iced Toddy. Nope...no big deal. I asked instead for iced coffee with two shots of espresso in it. She said sure, no problem. \n\nWhat she handed me was A CUP OF ICE with two BITTER, BITTER, BITTER shots of espresso in the bottom. (That's not me being hyperbolic. I came home and made everyone in the house try the most bitter coffee concoction I've ever come across.) Okay so then she sent me over to the bar to the hot coffee. Melted my ice and my plastic cup. Not exactly what I meant when I asked if they had iced coffee... \n\nHow much did this crud cost me?? A whooping $2.75. Oh, but wait! It's actually $3.00, an extra 25 cents for running it on my card, which she tells me AS SHE SWIPES MY CARD. I had cash on me. And I really would have preferred to be offered a choice to use it ahead of time. \n\nAlso, their seating consists mostly of a long bar against the wall opposite of the coffee counter. You wouldn't be able to camp out here with a laptop, homework, or even a book. There just isn't any room. There's a few tables, but if a group walked in you'd have a major guilt trip. \n\nAll in all, you'd go to Hava Java for a run and go coffee. And frankly, I never want to put that stuff in my mouth again. I don't see what this place has to offer.
4	Villagio is an Town-home community located just a couple miles East of Arizona State University and is right off the 101 freeway. Due to it's location it is a great place for Students and young professionals to live. I wouldn't want to live here if I didn't desire to be in the college scene. As a Realtor in the East Valley with The Hill Group, I can say that it is a great place to invest in if you are looking to buy, hold, and rent out a property as the demand is always high. It's also a great place to buy and let your child live in while they go to school rather than rent. The great part about this location and all of North Tempe is every year there is an influx of new people who need a place to live. This has really assisted Villagio in retaining its desirability and therefore value.  The community itself was built by DR Horton, a very reputable builder, in the mid 2000's. All the units are 2 or 3 bedrooms with private garages, as well as washer and dryers. The community is gated, with 3 different pools, the main one located near the main entrance, and it is a beautiful community with a strong HOA. I highly recommend this community if what I described is something you are looking for.
4	"""If you are new in town Valle Luna is a must stop for some great mexican food.  They have a few valley locations and will not disappoint.  \nThe Sonoran Todo (Appetizer) is a platter of Mexican fried delights and can be shared by 2-3 people for your MEAL.  Its a great deal and super tasty.  The Pollo Fundido is also a must and can also be split as it comes with rice and beans.\n\nThe atmosphere is typical any mexican food spot, so pretty much out of date with several \team\"""" photos of teams they support lining the walls.  The service is usually pretty good as well, but its the food that makes this place a must visit."""""""
2	I had eaten breakfast twice at the Chandler Chompies and loved it so I wanted my husband to try them.  However, we went to the Tempe location instead.  Much older restaurant (pretty worn) and it took some time for me not to be grossed out by the nasty overall smell of the place.  My breakfast wasn't half as good this time and my husband didn't like his either - just boring and not repeatable.  Hoping he'll give me another shot and we'll make the drive out to Chandler next time.
2	"""I really like the vibe at Next, and the cubano coffee drink is delicious.\n\nBut my experience with their sandwiches sadly takes the top three stars off my review.\n\nI have eaten the sandwiches three times.  Once I had the \tiny tuna,\"""" some tuna on a roll about the size of an English muffin, for $4.95.  I also tried the BBQ chicken sandwich and the turkey burger, both the size of a six-inch sub, for $9.95.  The tuna was very plain, with just some soft mixed greens on the sandwich.  The meat on the BBQ chicken sandwich was kind of rubbery, and the bottom piece of bread was completely drenched into mushiness from the coleslaw on the sandwich (which seems to be added when the sandwich is prepared at the beginning of the day for the display case, and simply taken out and heated for a few minutes when someone orders a sandwich.)  The turkey burger was dry and without much flavor.\n\nThey were not terrible sandwiches, but for the price, especially the larger ones are entirely not worth it.  For $10 I expect a restaurant-style sandwich, with flavor, and maybe a better side than the cheap tortilla chips they serve with it.\n\nI am not a normally negative reviewer, you can see if you look at my other reviews.  And I worked in the restaurant industry for four years, so I understand the struggles and I try not to be super-picky about my food and its quality.  But, I went to Next three different times and didn't like a single thing I ate.  So I figure I should at least warn other visitors not to drop ten bucks on a sandwich there.\n\nSorry Next!  Let me know if you improve things and I will come try again!"""""""
3	The food here is good, but it's just not what I think of when I think gryos or Greek cuisine, even though the menu is mostly that plus apps like hummus. I find the chicken shawarma over-seasoned to the point I can't even taste the tzatziki on my pita. It is a good choice if you are simply looking for something chickeny and in a pita, which I am like 3 out of 5 days of the work week.\n\nThey have all kinds of other food here like burgers, dogs, fried stuff. I can't attest to any of it besides the fries which I think are really crisp and I love the seasoning. The portion is huge, good for sharing. They have Diet Dr Pepper on their fountain which is such a rarity I may have to go back just for that.
4	What can you say about Trader Joe's?  It's a great store in most ways but a lil lacking in some.  I almost always have to supplement my shopping days with a trip to another grocery store when I go here but, I still love it.  It's got the best in whole, organic foods.  \n\nI like the idea of this store and have tried many new things from their shelves.  Some of my favorites are the TJ's Greek yogurt, Puffin's Peanut Butter cereal, and their mochi ice cream!\n\nSee ya there!
4	"""Thoughts while on the trail:  Nice short hike. Very rocky, uneven surface. Pretty sure half of Phoenix is on the trail with us!\n\nSo now that I'm off the trail and back home, I've got to say I really enjoyed the hike today.  The November weather was perfect and made the climb very pleasant.  I took my 7 yr old son with me and he did great.  Although the trail is very rocky and rugged (particularly for an \improved\"""" pathway), it is a simple hike.  I saw a lot of people wearing running shoes, but I've got to admit there is no way that would have worked for me.  It would be super simple to roll an ankle on the jutting rocks.  Plus, I  would think that the soft sole of a running shoe would expose your feet to the rock points.  I wore hiking boots and was happy that I did.\n\nI kept reading about having to scramble over rocks and had imagined needing ropes.  But the fact is, the only rock climbing we did was no more than running up a staircase two at a time.  It really was not a problem.  \n\nThe real negative for me was all the \""""company\"""" on the trail.  All my hiking experience up till now has been in more remote areas.  I suppose because Piestewa Peak is located inside a major city I shouldn't be surprised.  But I've got to tell you, there are A LOT of people there.  A few rude, but most very considerate and nice.  Still, hiking like ants in a line is a bit strange.  But I am a fan, none the less."""""""
2	This is my first review here but I willgo back to try a sandwich. I went in for lunch and met a couple people. I only got a soup and salad because the staff was rushing me to decide. There were way too many choices with way too much pressure. I was really looking forward to a good sandwich too :(. The soup an salad was ok but not satisfying. My boyfriend has the pulled pork and he was unsatisfied. He said and I agree that it was pure sauce and you could never tell what meat it was because of the sauce overload and because of the look of the meat. scary!!!
5	I am so pleased with the lunch I just picked up here I'm writing this review while I eat it (much better use of multi-tasking than getting back to work as intended, don't you think?). \n\nPerusing Yelp for a decent Chinese place near my office, I found the Gourmet Wok was just about a mile away hidden behind a Taco Bell in a strip mall tucked between a nail salon and a dentist office run by a guy name Nguyen. A little Google magic revealed their menu and list of lunch specials. I ordered the Szechuan Chicken, which was $4.45. You have to pay a premium of $4.75 for beef or shrimp And, because I already threw caution to the wind this morning and had margarine on my white toast, I went ahead and had them throw in an egg roll for another $0.70. I also kind of figured I wasn't getting much food for under $5, which was an incorrect assumption on my part as I will likely be eating left over Chinese for dinner tonight. \n\nThe food itself was very flavorful (albeit not hot enough for me, but that's why I keep Sriracha packets in my desk drawer anyway) and there was plenty of it. The broccoli was still bright green and crunchy, there were lots of carrots and they mixed in lots of those little baby corn bits everyone loves. \n\nI grabbed a couple of take out menus for the office and will try to entice my co-workers into switching to this place for delivery ($10 minimum so I'll need some help) from the other place nearby, whose name I will not mention, with whom I am less enamored. \n\nIncidentally, I would say that this is definitely a takeout/delivery joint. The interior is not exactly decorated for comfort. It reminds me of the little Asian places I would order from in Toronto or San Francisco. Sometimes there is an indirect correlation - the less comfy the restaurant, the better the food - when it comes to good Chinese and/or Mexican.  \n\nWho knows what the next visit will bring, but for the moment, for the money, I could not be happier.
4	You know, this may be a huge chain, but this one works like a well oiled machine on crack.  I kid you not, the husband and I were in and out of here with full bellies in a matter of 23 minutes.  This location is certainly one of the nicer looking ones and it offers some of the best people watching ever.  Almost as good as the airport!  Service here is great; fast, efficient, and no-nonsense.  The food here is good, exactly as good as you expect from the Waffle House.  Don't come here expecting anything more refined than Denny's and you will be a happy camper like me.
2	This place screams style over substance.  In a sentence - trendy sexy Biltmore crowd fawns over overrated sushi.\n\nI really don't get why Zen 32 is always so crowded and busy.  Could it be that people here don't know good sushi?  I find that I keep trying to give this place a chance and will go back simply because it's one of the only bonafide sushi bars in the area - and perhaps everyone else is doing the same as well.  But mediocrity, my friend, will eventually ruin this place.  Service and long waits are to be expected here.  \n\nI even think I got sick on the happy hour sushi here a while back.  I'm blaming it on the vodka tonic and not the warmed over salmon roll, but eater beware.  The bar can get crowded too, but they have some fun watercolor boards at the bar to play around with.  Back in the restaurant, the sushi is kind of lackluster.  The sashimi and rolls I've had here were so-so.  I just haven't found this place to measure up.
3	i must admit, when i first came here i was like hmmmm.. a little to roudy for me but as my food came i actually got comforable\ni had Spinich 4 cheese quesadilla (i know its a greek resturaunt) but it was yummy! i also had the cilantro-jalapino hummus (very very tasty) i tried some of the chicken meditteranian salad (it was ok) and i had spankopia (to die for) \nservice was a little long but we had a big party, not to mention it was a Saturday night but still\nother than that it was GREAT!
5	Every time I vist the Desert Botanical Gardens I am again amazed at how wonderful it is. Last night we attended on of their Jazz in the Garden series concerts. It was perfect!\n\nKhani Cole performed for two hours in the Patio Cafe area with backdrop of Saguaro's, great food and drink. It was a wonderful evening under the stars.\n\nThe DBG has a lot to offer, you can learn about the desert and all the wonderful plants, they host events year-round and it's all in a very convenient location.\n\nIf you haven't been here you're missing out!
2	"""We did what other visitors have undoubtedly done many times before us and stopped to eat breakfast, mainly because we couldn't resist the HUGE glowing neon sign shaped like a flying saucer and perched high above the parking lot. \n\nWe were on our way back Phoenix, it was early morning and I wanted to give it a shot, against my husband's better judgement...I shoulda listened to that fool. \n\nAnyway, it seems like it is the only \real\"""" restaurant in the tiny town although I think I remember something like a Jack in the Crack or Burger King nearby. It's built right in front of a small motel so they probably get the bulk of the customers from there, truckers and tourists and such. \n\nAs soon as you walk in, you will see a humongous painting of a Star Trek type ship on the main wall. There is Oldies radio blaring in the background and a supposedly, although unfilled \""""famous\"""" salad bar. \nThere is a minuscule gift shop, lots of junk from China and a few gems. They do have a very bitchen china pattern, the heavy old school china that could break your head if someone pitched it at you in a fit. The cups, saucers and serving plates have a very cool UFO design with I believe the words \"""" Space Age\"""" printed on it. \n\nGrowing up in a restaurant family, it amazes me to no end that a restaurant that could be doing a bang up business by playing up the whole UFO shtick is nothing more than a tired, little restaurant where you are served by some really sad, unfriendly women. One high point, they had very clean bathrooms which smelled of bleach... but overall a sad vibe and lame ass food. \n\nThe marketing possibilities are mind boggling but apparently just being a dive works for them. The food?...oh yeah, the food. \n\nLame, lame, lame. Skip it."""""""
4	first off..I rarely eat red meat so when I do it better be good.  My husband took me to Zinburger last week for my first time and I am definitely a fan.  The bun was perfect, the Kobe burger cooked perfectly and very tasty..and don't forget the zucchini fries that I wished I didn't have to split with my husband.  The atmosphere kind of reminds me of an upscale employee cafeteria, but the bar area/patio was good for people watching.  I will def go back!
5	First let me say thank you to Stateside Presents for creating a music venue, in the heart of downtown Phoenix!  I was ecstatic to hear of this venue and when I went to my first show there, I was happy it lived up to all the hype.  I love the bleacher style seating in the back, for those shows you don't feel like standing at...genius idea.  Everything about this place, is the perfect size.  Chris Bianco, of Pizzeria Bianco, and Doug Robson, of Gallo Blanco (located in the Clarendon Hotel) oversee the menu here and they offer some vegan options, so it is an automatic win in my opinion!  Not a huge menu, but it is just enough.  You can eat, have a few drinks and then head in to the ballroom for the show....makes for a nice evening.  And when there isn't a show happening, it is open for business as usual and DJ's are spinning some of your favorite tunes.  All in all, I dig this place and highly recommend it.
5	So this one tops King's Buffet for us! A tiny bit pricier because the $8.99 doesn't include drinks like King's does but TOTALLY worth it! And yes, their teriyaki chicken is better than King's too!!\n\nWe (my husband, daughter, and I) met up with Rand H. and Mike C. for lunch today and it was a great choice! So much variety and everything was fresh and steaming. Service was awesome and the right amount of helpful, not in your face but there when you needed it. \n\nMy only complaint was the fried rice, they only had shrimp fried rice out today and I'm allergic to shrimp so I had to pass. My husband loved everything he tried except the sweet and sour chicken, it tasted a tad bit bland to him but I thought it was fine. Not spectacular like everything else but still great. My daughter ate everything we offered her (not typical lately!) and was delighted with the beautiful fresh plump grapes they had available. I believe she also stole my husband's chinese donut and loved it too. \n\nBy the way, this 5-star rating may just be the first one I've handed out to date so congrats to you Hong Kong Gourmet! And thank you for the awesome food!!!
2	"""Absolutely horrifying.\n\nThis is clearly where strippers go to die. Fat, old, bored, and heinous looking moms and meth-heads giving not-so-discreet handjobs to shifty patrons... nobody tipping at all (which begs the question, \why do they come to work?\"""")... and an overwhelming cloud of depression and angst looming over the whole nasty parade.\n\nThe place was surprisingly active for a Wednesday afternoon. It took several minutes for my eyes to adjust to the darkness - I imagine keeping it so dark can only help given the sorry state of the girls. There's no VIP room that I could tell (unless you count the shabby bathrooms), but that didn't stop the shenanigans going on out in the open for my virgin eyes to see. There were definitely men being \""""gotten off\"""" here which disgusted me to no end. I have no idea how much it costs, but it can't be terribly expensive (and yet it's surely too much). \n\nAnother possible \""""up-side\"""" to this place (depending on your perspective) is that they will serve you an illegal amount of alcohol... the law be damned. This is perhaps another aid to help make the beasts on stage easier to stomach. \n\nSpeaking of stomachs, Eric was right - there were definitely some very pregnant ladies here. Kinda disturbing. My friend decided she wanted to get a dance from either the oldest girl or the fattest girl in the joint. The girl she picked put her mouth on my friend's vagina through her pants and did some sort of heavy breathing and moaning... my friend looked mortified and all she could do was let out some uncomfortable  panicked laughter. She was also groped and molested beyond her comfort levels. \n\nNothing in here was sexy at all - it's basically a really dark and moderately scary dive bar with a bunch of whores walking around with their ugly boobs out willing to do whatever for a few bucks. These girls clearly don't make much money (unless the special services pay well)... my friend and I would tip 5 bucks to the stage dancers (and their center stage is a joke) and they would thank us with a surprised look as though it had never happened before. \n\nThe seating looked like it was purchased from a conference hall at the Ramada Inn that was shut down 10 years ago and the girls looked like they wandered in off Van Buren 10 years ago. I suggest you stay away, however I can attest (as Eric P pointed out) that this was a source of some amazing comedy and laughter... hence the extra star."""""""
4	Would have given them 3 1/2 - food was four star but service made them lose some.\n\nGracious hostess who sat us right away at a table near the bar.  Really lovely room and interesting, eclectic blend of Southwestern and other styles.  Lighting was very complimentary to all - gotta love that!\n\nGood margaritas, delicious skirt steak tacos, the white bean pur\u00e9e was fabulous as were the green beans.  And the pumpkin bread pudding was one of best desserts I've had in some time.\n\nSo what was wrong?  Service was so rushed I felt like there was a timer on the back of our chairs.  Message was loud and clear - hurry up and eat and get out!!!
5	I frequent Nordstrom cafe for lunch almost once a week.  Although the food is outstanding, the service is what keeps me loyal.  Each time I go, an employee named Rick recognizes me and immediately takes care of me and my guests like a 5 star dining establishment.  He is attentive and always remembers what we drink etc.  I have never seen such a dedicated employee who clealry cares about his customers and takes the upmost pride in his job,  He always makes our dining experience remarkable.  I highly recomend visiting this wonderful cafe and if you are lucky, Rick will be your server.  He really is a gem!!!!
5	What I Bought:  I purchased a mid-century wooden bench, a mid-century liquor cabinet, two minimalist wooden chairs, and a funky painting called Dancing Monsters. \n\nQuality of the Product:  Spectacular.  My fiance and I love everything that we bough from here.  The owner's taste in furniture is a little funky and classic, which is exactly what we are looking for!  10 out of 10.\n\nCustomer Service:  I always forget her name, but she is bar far the best owner of any retail store up and down 7th Ave.  She has great suggestions and is always extremely friendly when we show up.  And another plus, she is a huge animal lover . . . .we adopted three cats from the animal shelter she volunteers at it.  10 out of 10.\n\nValue:  The price were fair and reasonable.  I wouldn't say it was a steal, but I figured that both sides came away with a pretty honest and worthwhile deal.  10 out of 10.\n\nOverall:  Go-Kat-Go my fiances and my first stop when we go to 7th Ave.  The friendly customer service, the selection, and the prices make this place a winner.  30 out of 30, 5 out of 5 stars.
1	Where to start... Have you ever eaten at Panda Express???  Well, if you have you will have enjoyed a better meal for sure.  After reading the mixed reviews I was a little leery about what to expect at Jade Palace.  I have to say that we were seated right away and the service was excellent throughout the meal.  As for the food, wow what a disappointment.  We ordered the wonton soup to start and it tasted like water with very little flavor.  Next we had some appetizers... beef skewers and pan fried dumplings.  The beef skewers had a very fishy flavor to them as if they were mixed with something fishy in the kitchen prior to being plated for us. The pan fried dumplings were not bad, but in the second one I bit into a rock hard piece of something that was the size of a small marble.  Maybe it was a bone or something, but I can't be sure.  Next the main courses.. we ordered the general Tso's Chicken which is kind of a staple at most chinese restaurants and all varying somewhat.  It was all breading and very little chicken to be found. What we did see was a mix of some white meat and majority dark meat. Overall not a tasty plate at all. We also ordered the Szechuan Shredded Pork and this was just plain simple. Thin strips of pork mixed with veggies which were not bad, but the pork was in some type of brown sauce with zero flavor.  So to sum it up, I will not being going to Jade Palace ever again.  There were just too many things that did not go right to even consider trying it again.  In all honesty, the best part of the meal was the noodles and duck sauce.  Yes that did remind me of my days back in NY and that was great.  However, in no way does this place resemble in any way shape or form NY style chinese food other than in the menu items offered.  If jade Palace were to open in NY it would close in a week.  I have eaten in hundreds of Chinese restaurants in NY from high end places like Chin Chin all the way to delivery places like China Fun and this place does not hold a candle.  Too bad as we love living here in Scottsdale, but the food quality leaves a ton to be desired as of yet.  We will continue our search and keep fellow Yelpers apprised of our findings, good or bad.  By the way, I have no bone to pick with Jade Palace, just being truthful.  When I find something good I will post about that as well with the same type of enthusiasm.
4	The food may all be the same but with nearly all convenience meals it's the people that make or break how you feel about it. After all in two weeks are you going to recall what was in that burrito versus the way the staff treated you ?  \n\nReally really well. Despite the person in front of me inquiring about the relative healthfulness of the options available he helped her out as much as it's practical without the level of annoyance/ amusement that would have had me flicking pinto beans at their nose .   Still  moving on to me, crowd came up quickly, they changed gear  into dining speed but still managed to ask about the day, t-giving and the like both the counter staff were not faking in a manner I feel certain coffee shops appear to require, cough bucks.That's why I like this, and every other ,Chipotle   it's not the food but the people.  \n\nBurrito was pretty good and more importantly  viable to eat and drive with ( who says texting is the greatest danger out there:D ) which is a skill that most ____ Bell places can't remotely conceive of with a third of the contents.
1	"""I used a Groupon for 40 units of Botox. I have been doing 40 units of botox on my forehead and between by eyes for 10 years. Forty units always literally freezes that area; however, this time not even close which leads me to believe that the botox is diluted or they are not truly injecting the 40 units. I have used many different doctors/med spas for the procedure and this never was the case when I got 40 units. I ALWAYS had a positive result. This time the woman administering the botox said \when you check out they will tell you how much it will cost if you want to touch up\"""" the area. Basically reel you in with a GROUPON so you think you are getting a good deal and then just charge you more on a return visit before the necessary time.\nTry NLI Medspa run by the National Laser Institute in Scottsdale.

3	"""This quaint Coronado cottage restaurant, situated in a home built in the 1930s, offers Italian and Greek fare.  There are roughly a half dozen small and intimate tables, and PAN AM memorabilia covers the walls.  Outside you will find a courtyard with a bubbling fountain, inside old hardwood floors that have stood the test of time.\n\nIt is cozy and intimate, but unfortunately this restaurant, voted \Best Mom and Pop Restaurant\"""" by Phoenix New Times falls short.\n\nThe dishes are a combination of Greek and Italian, predominated by the staid dishes such as Hummus, Gyro, Caprese, Bruschetta, and a smattering of sandwiches such as the \""""Prosciutto\"""" with fresh mozzarella and sundried tomatoes. The prices are very reasonable, and the average cost of an appetizer or sandwich is between $6-$8.  But there is nothing remarkable about the dishes.  Having tried the hummus (garlic was overpowering and stung the tastebuds), the Caprese Salad (too heavy on the balsamic), The Gyro Pita (meat was tender and juicy), and the Sausage and Peppers sandwich (very generous portion and handmade fennel sausage very flavorful and juicy) I can't say that I would go out of my way to come here to eat.  \n\nAlthough I came here for lunch, the server recommended I try their Shrimp Santorini sometime for dinner, and he also recommended the Leg of Lamb.  \n\nThere must be a reason why this restaurant has been here for 15 years, I just happened to find that the most interesting thing about the place was the building itself.\n\nAnd although there was a sizable display case of empty gelato containers, there was no gelato to be had."""""""
3	"""This is my second time at Casa Filipina. I was hoping that this would merit a 4, maybe even 5 star review, but alas, I was disappointed and even embarrassed that I suggested this place to a fellow yelper. \n\nI raved to Jetta R., \Oh this place is so cute! The food is amazing and the service was great! We should totally hit this place up for lunch.\"""" \n\nWe walk in the door and were treated like I was on my first visit. Seated, given menus and place mats; water and silverware were promptly produced. \n\nWe even had some of the curious dishes explained to us. \n\nJust a note, the food was really good, the first (and second) time I ordered the Bistek Tagalog. This time I felt it was lacking juiciness and the meat was difficult to cut with a fork (but the first time I ordered this dish it was so succulent it melted in my mouth.) \n\nOne plus I didn't receive last time was the offer for a second helping of rice. \n\nI asked for soy sauce and the waiter said he'd be right back, he disappeared and then started talking with another customer for 20 minutes. \n\nThen Jetta and I decided to order dessert, it is a bakeshop after all! \nI ordered the Creme Brule, but when they came to clean the table off I wanted to save my spoon. The gentleman (whom I think to be the owner) said that he would bring me a clean one. Jetta, being the lady she is decided to wait until my spoon arrived. After 10 minutes of waiting I told her to dig in, finally while taking food to another table, the owner apologized for forgetting about my spoon. \n\nUsually I am one for forgiveness, but not when there are only four customers in your restaurant and Jetta and I are two of them. \n\nI can't believe how I went from super impressed to completely devastated. I want to try you again CFB, but I just don't know."""""""
4	We recently had my sister and her finances wedding shower at Postinos and it could not have gone any better! There was a bit of confusion at the beginning of the evening but it was quickly taken care of. All of the staff was extremely attentive and helpful. As expected, the bruschetta and Panini's were superb and they had a ton of wine and beer choices for the guests. The only drawback was a live acoustic band playing the whole time that we were not made aware of until the day before our event. It was rather hard to hear everyone as we played shower games but at least they weren't terrible sounding. I would definitely recommend for anyone to hold a special event there!
5	Love, love, love Echo coffee. \nThe baristas are always super helpful (and patient when you don't know what you want.) They also always put a cute design on top... call me trivial. \nThey have a variety of milks (whole/ half and half/ non fat/ soy/ almond) and do an awesome espresso pour. \n\nThey roast all their beans in house. It is my favorite smell to walk into the door and they are roasting... it's intoxicating. \n\nThe owner is super nice and when he is around always willing to answer questions about the roasting process, where they get their beans and any coffee inquiries you might just be wondering about. \n\nAlways recommend this place to people if you're going to be in the area. \n*They do offer sandwiches and salads from 11-3 and have pastries all the time. \n\nChill enough to go and grab a cup and hang out... can get a little crammed but most everyone there is really polite and will even share a table if you're up for it. \n\nDefinitely worth a little drive if you're into checking new coffee houses out. \n\nGreat hours, open 6a-10p every day!
5	I really love this place!! Nothinglike a fun Sunday meal with my family to make me love it even more. We stuffed ourselves with delish catfish, fried shrimp , and tasty hazelnut Mahi. Service from Rocky was \nreally fast , effiecient without that fake cloying attitude. Felt like we were\nthe center of the restaurant. Funny how things like fast drink refills, quick service and welltime plate removal can do that.  \nAnd here is the kicker of the evening ..I know have ordered or tasted every dessert on thier dessert tray, scary but true. Did you know that three of their desserts are made fresh there the rest including cheesecakes are made in Texas and brought in. I got the fresh Brulee  . yummy.   Can't wait to go back.
4	After reading a lot of negative reviews about the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort, I was worried about our upcoming reservation.  I am happy to say that my family and I had a WONDERFUL time at the resort.  The pool and lazy river was awesome.  We had accommodations, a two bedroom Casita that was worth every penny.  It is great to go on vacation and feel right at home.  The staff was excellent.  No complaints except for the weather, wish we had a little more sun for the kids.
2	Seriously, if I had the choice to stay somewhere else, I would. But because this was an all expense-paid trip by my job, I had no choice but to suck it up. Being that this hotel is part of the Marriott family, you would think it would be a good place to stay in for 7 weeks. But it's not. It could've been way better. \n\nLocation: Hotel was hard to find at first. They are located right off of the I-17 but they are hidden behind the Marriott Springhill Suites. You'd have to drive into the Springhill Suites parking lot to get to the Towneplace Suites. We drove a few circles before we found the hotel. \n\nRoom: Sticky rug - seems like someone spit their gum out on this one spot by the foot of the bed. Yuck! Not enough hangers - front desk gave me what they had left but it still wasn't enough. No dresser, although there were 2 small night stands on both sides of the bed. But how convenient would it be to get ready for work in the morning and have to go back and forth to get your clothes? I kept most of my stuff in my suitcase. And my room was not equipped with a suitcase stand! Savages!! My a/c unit didn't have a shield so my curtains would blow out every time the air came on. What happened to the little details that matter to the traveler on a business trip away from all the comforts of home? \n\nBathroom: The bathtub drain was clogged. So every shower was like standing in dirty bathwater. Made me homesick for my own bathroom with my unclogged shower drain... \n\nHousekeeping: I didn't have them clean my room everyday but when they did, they did a good job for the most part. But again, it was the little things like replacing the dish-washing soap for the dishwasher after I used a packet. Or leaving a spare toilet paper roll. I had to use a box of tissues in the meantime. \n\nOther things: Their gym had old equipment and only one stationary bike and treadmill. Their door keys/door lock devices suck! I had to get my cards replaced more than 3 times, and had to have the front desk reprogram my lock after having problems with the key. I swear I was keeping the key away from devices like my cell phone and credit cards! Such an inconvenience when you can't get into your own room after a long day at work! \n\nThe area is a little shady but there are restaurants close by and the front desk attendants are nice. But if you travel a lot for long periods of time, look elsewhere. You may thank me for it later!
4	Jacob rocked!  We sat on the patio, we love the patios in Arizona! Jacob engaged our two children, which is always the sign of a great server and creates great dining memories for the kids! \n\nWe started with dessert first and Jacob brought our cheesecakes out super fast. Very attentive and courteous to listen to our kids' drawn out stories. He even had extra bread sent out to us, yummy!  \n\nThe food is always great at the Factory, but the service Jacob provided made our visit Fantastic!  Thanks Jacob!!
2	"""My boyfriend and I were very disappointed by this restaurant. We expected to be impressed, and simply were not. This place does not live up to its hype. \n\nWe came here for a birthday dinner, and I had a certificate for a free Beef Medallions with Shrimp Scampi. We also ordered the Brio Chopped salad and Calamari. \n\nThe salad was delicious, but we weren't impressed by much else. The calamari was tasteless to say the least. The beef medallions were not cooked to our preference- we ordered them medium rare and they came out well done. The \shrimp scampi\"""" was about 3 shrimp on top of the medallions, all sitting on a bed of orzo pasta and small pieces of roasted vegetables tossed in a sauce. \n\nWe were just so disappointed. I would suggest going somewhere else."""""""
5	"""So I went out and did the indoor skydiving thing at SkyVenture in Eloy.  On the way back to Phoenix I was starving and hit up Yelp to find something worth eating.  Tommy's Bistro came up on a search and most of the reviews were favorable and it sounded interesting so I figured i would give it a shot.\n\nThe Good:\n\nGranted, I came it at around 3 or 4pm, so a little early, but the owner/chef Tommy himself was sitting at the bar.  He was friendly and good to chat with.  Service staff was quick to get me a drink, menu, and suggestions.  They had a lamb shank specialty with grilled asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes that I ended up having as my meal. The sauce on the lamb was amazing...a little bit of a sweet taste with some spice to it....I don't recall now what Tommy said it was made from...but it was delicious.  The lamb itself....excellent.  Asparagus.  I don't like asparagus...at least I didn't until I had it here.  Tommy even said \no one makes it like I do.\""""  Well...I believe it...because I never cared for it before I had it here.  Garlic mashed potatoes were perfect.  They had a distinct garlic flavor...more than enough for me...but not too overpowering (although that would not have bothered me).  The staff recommended how I order it...medium-rare, and for that dish at that restaurant, it was dead on. \n\nSo in summary, service, great, dinner, great.  How can I not rate this place as top notch?  If I ever have a reason to be down in the area again, I know of at least one delicious place to dine."""""""
4	In my quest to find bottled soda to filled the void left by the closing of Pop the Soda Shoppe in Scottsdale, I decided to check out A.J.'s.  I've always been impressed by their meat selection.  You can't fault a place that sells crawfish, oysters, trout, and pretty much any other cut of meat you can think of.  \n\nWhen I found the bottled sodas, I was in heaven.  They have a chilled section with single bottles, and a shelf with packs.  They don't have a gigantic selection, but considering it's not a soda shop, you can't fault them for just having one shelf devoted to bottled sodas.  They had Sonoran Root Beer, Moxie, Boylan's Creamy Red Birch, Dublin Dr. Pepper, Sioux City, Oogave, Thomas Kemper, Jones...the list goes on.  Needless to say, I spent $30 there that day.\n\nThis is no Wegman's by any means... But I don't think we can expect a Wegman's replacement short of an actual Wegman's opening in town.
4	this restuarant is a well-kept secret. the food is great -- try the vegetable medley -- and the staff is excellent. it's almost always deserted during dinner, so it's like having an entire restaurant to yourself. \n\nthe best part. if you have an entertainment book, your meals are always 2-for-1 (expect on holidays). they never punch your diner's card, so you can use it as many times as you want. i'm talking about a prime rib dinner for two people for less than $20.
5	Brought 5 homesick, cafeteria overloaded students here last night and it was fabulous. We had at least 12 rolls including the spider, caterpillar, and sedona, and the sushi was fresh, delicious, and beautifully presented. We also ordered off the menu, and my udon was great. The broth was flavorful and delicate, noodles not overcooked at all. The sushi chef was really quick banging out our orders (I guess we looked hungry!) and I was just very impressed how neatly it was presented AND good too. I guess I have been to too many sloppy sushi restaurants and am a little fed up with so-so efforts. I know that this will become one of our go-to spots whenever we come to Tempe/Scottsdale.
5	I just moved here from SF and being from there i was desperate for finding some asian/ chinese supermarket to do my grocery shopping.  Not knowing where to go, I first went to Asiana market since it is right across the street from me and it was a disappointment.  But then I found Lee Lee on yelp and thought i would give this place a try.  Finally, today I went and I was SUPER happy!!! I found my usual items and more and was very happy with how clean and spacious it was. \n\nThey have a wonderful selection of produce, seafood, frozen items, dried goods, and even pots and pans.  Everything seemed packaged nicely and things were easy to find.  The staff was friendly and the prices arent too bad, they are a little more than what Im used to in SF but this is good enough for me =)
5	"""So very, very, very good. I'm staying at a hotel down the street and really wanted pizza for dinner (and also wanted to take a little walk!) so the Gelato Spot it was. When I saw \gelato and wood fired pizza\"""" together on my Yelp app, I knew it was going to be a win-win situation.\n\nI have NEVER seen a place with this many gelato flavors. Holy cow! Any flavor you've ever wanted is here, and I was trying to decide which one I wanted to go with, when I laid my eyes on the sign... for gelato shakes. Gelato? Shakes? Gelato in a shake? I had to try it, and went with the small which meant I got to choose two flavors. Yellow cake batter and cookies and cream, it turns out, make quite a nice pair. They put them both in a blender with milk, and voil\u00e0! Something tells me I'll be visiting this place later in the week for another genius flavor concoction.\n\nFor my pizza, I ordered the marinara, which comes with Di Napoli tomato sauce, fresh garlic, fresh basil, oregano, and Tuscan olive oil. I also added cheese to it. I carried it for about fifteen minutes back to my hotel and I was surprised at how well it held up! The pizza was so good, and the flavors all blended together perfectly. I really enjoyed the thin and chewy crust, and you could tell that the ingredients were high quality.\n\nI hear they have amazing coffee here and I want to try that next time... but if I had to choose one thing from this place, it's the gelato shake. Go try one for yourself and find out!"""""""
5	Well I was taken out the other day and the person who knew I love a good burger suggested this place, being that I never heard of it I was like sure ok.\n\nWOW is all I can say, the menu was very interesting and it all looked and sounded good. \n\nSo I order the BBQ, Bacon & Chedder, and a order of Smash Fries (French Fries with oil and some seasoning)\n\nI go and get my drink and sit down and the order is brought to my table.\n\nBurger was cooked to the way I asked for the and the fries were awesome.\n\nThe burger was very tasty and not dry (People who kavetch about grease, HELLO a burger is supposed to be greasy, this is not a heath food choice!!! and to the reviewer complaining about her Veggie Burger, really? why are you getting something that looks like a burger? Go have a salad.)\n\nThe food was served quite quickly and seating was not a issue, I want to go back to this place soon.
3	At first I thought oOoh sushi and seafood buffet! Yay to all you can eat sushi and seafood for the cheap price of $15.88 ....then when I went to get my food - I took a look at the sushi station - hmMmM  it's a Wednesday night and not very busy...those rolls and sashimi looks like they've been out on the plate for a while.....ehhh maybe it won't be too bad....so I decided to get just a few salmon and mackeral sashimi and one - what looks like a yellowtail handroll.However, they have a pretty good selection of other foods - the seafood section had crawfish, king crab legs, fried crab, shrimp, periwinkle, scallop salad on the shell and cooked salmon....I tried a little of each and besides the periwinkle, the other is pretty good. The sushi/sashimi I had, however was not so good -- the salmon sashimi was warm, so was the mackeral sashimi, and the one hand roll I had was not really edible - it was chewy and I was a bit afraid to eat the fish cause it didn't seem so fresh after all. So I steered clear of the raw stuff - especially when it's not a busy lunch/dinner time and when it looks like they have been sitting there for awhile - I think the problem was that they didn't put ice underneath the plates that served the sashimi and the lights above it really warmed it up. \n\nThe other food sections they had were meats - bbq pork, short ribs (good taste but chewy), roasted duck, sausages, korean bbq ribs, teriyaki chicken and some grilled octopus and zucchini. and some other food sections you'll see normally at this type of Asian buffet. \n\nAs I walked around I noticed that they had a whole fridge of Dryers Ice Cream - 6 different flavors of ice cream...not that soft frozen yogurt stuff they have at most buffets...now I was looking forward to dessert! hehe The dessert section was fancy too - they had chocolate cake, strawberry cake, flan, angel cake and cookies but none tickled my taste buds like the cookies n cream and mint chocolate chip ice cream I had. ;) \n\nOverall this place was, to my surprise, not bad at all.....for $16 bucks I had a pretty satisfying meal. the service was nice - gave me a refill on my drink before I even finished my first one...and was quick to clear out the plates.
3	I wrote a scathing review of BBD but I will reluctantly upgrade it from 1 star to 3 stars. David D. at customer service responded to my complaints promptly and politely. No...I did not receive a comp. nor did I want any. My only hope is they will take care of their problems as he stated to me in his reply so unsuspecting customers will no longer be taken advantage of. No....I definitely will still not be returning nor recommend them to anyone!
5	We just had 2 exterior doors replaced by Strong Home Improvement and we love them!!! Travis was a delight to work with - friendly, professional and a great work ethic. \nI am a very picky home owner and have been known to be a little difficult :) but Travis was able to meet all of my expectations. He came over twice to get the specifics, he explained to me exactly what he was going to do and kept me updated during the project. He was on-time and cleaned-up everything after he was done. \nWe have a great new front door and the backdoor looks great too!\nI have a couple more projects for Travis and I feel confident in recommending Strong Home Improvement to my friends and family.
4	"""I have not tried everything on their menu.  The grilled lemon chicken is amazing, and some of their deserts (pastries) are amazing.  \n\nMy problem is with the service.  A couple of times I have been charged the wrong price, other times \lunch\"""" prices seem to end at 3, while other times it ends at 4, and the lady (maybe the owner) is not very friendly.

4	I really love Maizie's. It became our weeknight, just feel like getting out of the house, spot for awhile. Their buffalo chicken dip is amazing. I actually found a recipe online that tastes exactly like it and I took it to all of my holiday parties. Big hit. The only problem is, we always drink at least 2 bottles of wine there. Anyway, the servers have always been really friendly and helpful, albeit sometimes a little slow but, to me, that's forgivable if they have a great personality.\n\nTake the light rail and check it out. Mondays they have $3 burger and fries!
5	As soon as the hostess saw us coming , she kindly opened the door for me & my wife! That was a great touch. \nAlso, our server was very nice and friendly. Overall all the service we recieved was top class and really had a family feel to it. You can tell the staff is kept happy and thats important and good to see.\n\nThe food was great! Good sized salads and the tenderloin sliders appetizer is seriously the best thing ever! I love going to a bar and grabbing some filet sliders w/ garlic aioli and au jus sauce with a beer!\n\nEverything was good. Water kept full.

5	My husband took me to Roy's when we first started dating and I have to say I was blown away by the food and service. \nMy husband had the Ahi and I swore I'd never take a bite of something that raw, well, it's now a favorite of mine, it melted in my mouth and was so truly amazing.

I have never ever tasted spoiled seafood at a good restaurant. It tastes like rotten eggs, but you can taste it in your mouth for hours to come... and hopefully you won't puke it up later. NASTY!!!  The server barely acknowledged this and the manager stated that \""""that's mother nature for you\"""". Excuse me? I understand the risks of eating seafood, but you should never handle a complaint like that... an \""""I'm so sorry,\"""" would have been the minimal acceptable response. Finally, everyone was getting free mini desserts (some chocolate cake thing) and our server never brought ours.. very obviously... and never comped us for the mussels... not even a 10% discount... If they treat their loyal customers in such a manner, especially on their first anniversary, then I think there are other restaurants where I can become loyal instead. ***********************************************************************\n   Original review:   Addicting! Roasted mussels are to die for!!! I keep getting this. The appetizer menu could use some work, but the desserts make up for it. Chocolate bacon s'mores and the pint of Guiness desserts are fascinating. Service is excellent and atmosphere is inviting. It's really busy though, so you better have a reservation. Nice addition to the hood!!! Finally."""""""

4	We're lucky to have Republic R+N in the Valley, let alone Tempe. It's an amazing ramen cafe - with six different broths and a dozen different add-ins from which to choose. Plus they just expanded the menu to include other classic fast Japanese favorites - curry, udon combos, etc. The space is beautiful, and the employees - every last one of them - are so friendly and helpful and accommodating. This is such a five star place!!!!\n\nMinor quibbles - extra spicy broth is almost indistinguishable from normal broth, and the curry is not traditional Japanese curry. It's OK, but not what you'd expect. Major quibble - what they charge for protein is simply outrageous. A few sprinklings of chicken, a few slices of pork or beef, a few cubes of tofu = two dollars added on??? An already pricey $7 bowl becomes a $10 bowl including tax because a (very) little protein is added? Unless this is Kobe beef, this is outrageous. Penny wise and pound foolish guys - triple the protein you serve or cut its price in half. The current pricing is crazy.\n\nC'mon guys - you're so five stars, just fix the protein problem! In the meantime, dear reader, this is still a place to relish at any price.
4	I am disappointed that my fellow Yelpers average a 3.5 stars because I loved this place.  The atmosphere is cozy, and the food was outstanding.  I had the Carnitas (real smoked flavor with a crunchy crust) and my mother had the Pollo con Espinacas (with a chipotle cream sauce to die for!).\n\nThe sangria was YUMMY as were the salsas.\n\nOK, OK, the service could have been better.  The server was fairly attentive, though I do not think he smiled at us once.  He must not have hurt my feelings too badly though because I am definitely going to return!
4	We met a friend here on a recent Saturday for lunch.  I was surprised how busy it was, since last time I was there, it wasn't quite a ghost town, but close.  Anywho, we had to wait about 10 minutes or so for our table to be prepared (party of 7), but it wasn't a big deal since we were a little bit early.  \n\nWe got seated and after chatting for a bit, placed our orders.  I don't remember what everyone else got, but I got a gyro.  I do remember that my wife's food did not get brought out in a timely manner.  Either they forgot to make it, or mistakenly gave it to another table.  As a result, my gyro was less than hot, because we all waited until she had her food.  Another weird thing...I figured the gyro would come with a salad or rice or something on the side...it was just straight gyro.  But, it was still quite delicious.  And other than that snafu, the service was good.  \n\nI would return to Pita Jungle.  Thought about three stars b/c of the food delay, but both times I've been the food has been quite good, and my food this time still had good flavor.  More like 3.75 rounded up to 4.
4	My wife and I had our date night at the Esplanade for the first time since it's renovation.  I was surprised at the changes made to the place.  Gone was the old ticket booth, and the lobby/concession stand area was turned into a bar lounge type atmosphere.  Looked like a cool spot to hang out and wait for your movie if you were early, or even to it and chat, if on a date, after the movie.\n\nYou can purchase your tickets at the automated machines, or buy/pick them up inside at Guest Services.  \n\nThe employees were very cordial as we passed them on our way to our seats inside the theater.  We decided on the Cinema Suites, since it was 21&over.  We were impressed with the layout, and the very comfortable seats that recline.  Our server was very nice and informative.  I was surprised when she was entering our order into her pad, the other servers were bring our drinks and appetizers.  WOW!  That's faster and more impressive than a restaurant.  \n\nI had the sirloin tips and mashed potato's, and my wife had the fried shrimp with fries.  I can't comment on any mixed drinks, (another reviewer complained of watered down drinks) mainly because we had wine. \n\nAll in all, it was ok.  Kinda like food at an Applebee's, or Chili's.  Nothing to go crazy about, mediocre, and over priced, but it WAS a MOVIE THEATER.  I mean, It's not a Michelin Star restaurant.  I don't care that it is in the Biltmore area.\n\nThe thing that annoyed us the most were the 2 pompous couple's we sat between.  They constantly complained about something.  Mostly their refills.  The waitress explains to you, should you need something, PUSH the call button.  They never did.  They expected someone to come by.  The point of the call button is to minimize the wait staff running around disturbing patrons who are watching the movie.  \n\nThis is the main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. They were really annoying. \n\nIt's like this.......You are at a THEATER that serves food and drinks.  Not at a Fancy restaurant that shows a movie.  You're paying for the comfort and experience of being able to relax, enjoy a drink or dinner, all while watching a movie.\n\nBottom line, Food was ok, a little over priced, so watch what or how much, you order.  If you like to drink, have a beer, wine, or straight drink, if you are so worried of getting it watered down.  The employees from beginning to end were excellent.  And the over all experience was very enjoyable and fun.  We would definitely do it again real soon.
4	Paradise Bakery has held the role of default fall-back convenience food for years.  I've never actively decided to seek one out, but somehow I wind up in a location at least twice a year, typically while waiting at the airport.  (PB cookies and airplanes are an excellent match.  Srsly.) I found myself with thirty minutes to kill in Avondale an hour before most places opened for lunch waiting for a somber event and there was the familiar sign beckoning me.\n\nExpect the typical Paradise Bakery food.  There's even something appealing about the crappy default white bread.  The service, however, excelled at this location.  I'm fairly sure I came across absolutely stoned, complete with blank stares and asking them to repeat questions.  They were seriously nice, though, the food was prompt, and it's a safe, solid 3.5 stars.\n\n Mmmmm chocolate chip cookies.
5	let me just say that this place is a gem! the bartenders are super pretty and the food looks and tastes awesome! the mussels and steak Au poive are SO good! the well liquor is top shelf and the happy hour is a steal! $5 wine and great martinis as well as $5 paninis that are huge and come w a salad too {the dressing is addictive! the super pretty blonde behind the bar also told me they do events for local charities and she also plans party's.\ni had my birthday there and she took care of everything from the drinks to the DJ. the owner is a refined man and this bar actually cares about the city and its people on all levels. i love it!
4	"""Fresh Salad Company is like a higher class version of Souper Salad, and a much better tasting version of Sweet Tomatoes.  The difference is that here, not only do you still get a \make your own salad\"""" option, but you can always choose one of their salad's off the menu too.\n\nIn addition to salads, they also have wraps on their menu and again, a \""""make your own wrap\"""" option.  I decided that I would make my own wrap, and that it would be damn tasty.  I chose the garlic herb wrap, and decided to fill it with so many vegetables that it would be a virtual veggie fiesta in my mouth. \n\nArtichoke, avocado, broccoli, onions, green peppers, black olives, sun dried tomatoes, celery, carrots...they were all there, smashed together in my wrap and drizzled with green goddess dressing and feta cheese.  It turned out to be a delicious wrap, but I found it to be a bit pricier than I expected.  I guess my addition of artichoke cost an extra 50 cents, and so did the avocado.  And, you can only choose 4 ingredients for your wrap, and the rest are 50 cents after that. Maybe I will tone down the veggie fiesta next time.\n\nAll in all, it was tasty, fresh food, and it was perfect for a fast lunch."""""""
4	I wasn't a big fan of Barbecue...  until today!  The food here is delicious, the staff is friendly, the prices reasonable, & they even have BOOTHS  :-))  back in their almost secret rear dining room!  You'll want to remember this back room when you come here, as the front table area fills up.\n\nOn this first visit ever, joined by friends Mike C., Arlin B. & Robyn N., I totally enjoyed the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Waffle Fries & their very tasty BBQ Baked Beans!\n\nNow it's off to try some of the other BBQ places around the Valley & see how they compare!     :-))\n\nPulled Pork Sandwich with 2 sides $7.99.
3	The food here is pretty good and very traditional.  They have a very large menu of all sorts of sushi and all sorts of other Japanese dishes, including LOADS of noodle dishes.  The sushi selection is awesome and the menus have pictures of everything.  The price is very reasonable.\nWhy did it get 3 stars?  The service.  I've had to wait a VERY long time to be seated and the wait staff doesn't come around a lot.  The sushi cooks are kinda rude and didn't talk to us at all.  But if you can get past the horrible service this place is worth a visit for the food.  The price is good too.
3	Fine.  Average.  The atmosphere inside is very low-key and seems good for families.  This is by no means a trendy hot spot.  Wide selection of menu options from salads to traditional items a la carte to a variety of house specialties.  \n\nChips and salsa were brought over immediately.  There was a regular salsa that looked like the kind you buy in a jar, and then a spicier one that looked like the Cholula hot sauce you buy in a jar.  And I saw them opening huge bags of chips. \n\nThe spinach con queso had a nice consistency and flavor.  It was served with different chips -- they were greasy, thick and softer - actually kind of flaky - so we stuck with the regular chips.  The chips and salsa guy was very attentive, coming back frequently to see if we needed more.  \n\nThe Santa Fe Salad was nothing special and they brought us the wrong one.  We'd asked for the dressing on the side but we thought oh well, we'll eat it anyway, and then someone brought over another one without dressing.  More importantly, the salad itself just wasn't impressive: huge iceberg/romaine lettuce that wasn't cut up very well, sliced grilled chicken, black beans, and corn topped in some kind of clear vinaigrette (although the menu said homemade chipotle ranch dressing).  I will say that the corn tamale with green chile sauce and cheese was delicious.
5	It's always nerve-wracking when you move to a new city and need to find a hairdresser. . .or maybe that's just me.  I decided to take a shot and scheduled an appointment for the same day, my shaggy mane was in desperate need of some maintenance.  As soon as I walked in, I could tell that I found my place.  I was greeted warmly and was put instantly at ease. The awesome Eleanor asked me what I was looking for and walked me through what she was going to do, making sure that was what I wanted.  She proceeded to work her magic on my locks.  I also got an eyebrow wax (one of the best I have ever received by far) which she also made sure I was happy with before I was even allowed to get out of the chair.  The cut and brow wax were reasonably priced and I am loving the new cut!  I will definitely be coming back.
1	"""I save one star reviews for exceptionally bad experiences and this was one of them. To make it short..it was over an hour before we had food on the table. I had to ask to get our order taken, then ask where our food was. It was EGGS people. It's breakfast. Not a sit down with a bottle of wine, have appetizers, chat... it was breakfast. For two people. My cousin and I walked in about 10am on a weekday. There were a ton of empty tables. We stood so long at the door with half a dozen staff people walking by us that I said \this is a bad sign maybe we should go somewhere else.\"""" And we really should have! When we finally got seated I had to ask for a waitress. After she appeared once she never came back. Until after I asked where our meal was. Usually in cases like this it's the processes that are bad not the people. But wow.. none the less... it was bad. Oh and the food.. was good. Not amazing. but good. But who cares by that time?"""""""
5	Came because the Best of Phoenix issue told me to.  After contemplating whether to take my daughter to the restaurant next to Club Tattoo, we entered the cleanest restaurant I've ever seen.  I think it is supposed to look like a dive with bricks showing through the walls, but it is just too clean.  The chips were fresh and salty and the salsa was runny and spicy; both delicious.  I order the pollo fundido to see what a fundido is.  After filling up on chips, my daughter ate one-fourth of my fundido (sans pollo because she is vegetarian), her beans, and none of her quesadilla.  The guacamole was fresh and the other three-fourths of the fundido tasted great.  The service was also great.  So if you are looking for some delicious, inexpensive Mexican food served really fast and in a clean restaurant, Moreno is your grill.
3	I like tho place, but I think that they are trying to ride on the coat tales of Whole Foods next door, but it is a PET supplies store, so people aren't going to pay the ridiculous prices that they do on human food (At least I won't...)  I went in there to get some really basic stuff for my fish tank and the people there didn't really have anyone that knew anything about fish and they didn't have a good selection at all.  \n\nI did like the selection of different kids of dog foods that this store had and they seemed to have a lot of different more healthy options for your dog, they even have a pretty impressive selection of refrigerated dog food and some stuff that looked like you would have to cook it for your dog... I don't know about you but I don't have the time to cook my dogs food for it, but I do think that it is neat that it is becoming more of an option for dog owners.  \n\nThe parking lot here is clean and so is the store and it is in a good part of town.

I loved the patio and the band playing.  I had the shrimp salad, which was ok, but it was actually drenched in dressing (forgot to ask for it on the side).

Fun, cool vibe about the place.  The server was generally attentive.  \n\nThe only negative that I found was that our server added an extra meal into our tab...when we brought it to her attention, rather than correcting the bill and bringing us the correct one (we had already given her cash and our two cards) and bringing everything back to us she just said that she would take the meal off.  It kind of screwed up our mojo when figuring out the bill...it all ended up being ok, but I think in the end, she screwed herself out of some of her tip. \n\nDefinitely will look forward to going back there sometime!"""""""
3	At first glance it looks like another chain with a clean well maintained landscaped and organized parking area.   The lobby looks like a big family cabin.   The front desk has freshly baked and covered cookies.  There is wrapped candy by the fireplace, fresh Granny Smith Apples by the door.  There is a coffee station by the time you reach the elevators.   \n\nMy room was clean and a pretty good size.   The window faced the alley with dumpsters and an area of parking for the hotel.   I had two comfortable Queen beds, a modern new widescreen t.v. and bubble ceilings.  The bathroom water can be very hot.  The bath and face soap was good, however, the shampoo, conditioner and moisturizer was not.  The front desk was quick to provide me with many bathroom amenities, however, I only needed toothpaste.    \n\nThere is a complimentary breakfast with canned tropical fruit which is quite good actually.   Fresh bananas, creamy oatmeal, dry cereals, yogurt, nuts, raisins, milk, 2%, tea, amazing waffles, powdered scrambled eggs, potatoes and sausage all well displayed.  The coffee was fresh and not good.   There are cheap looking danishes and pastries.  However, the whole wheat bread was moist and satisfying. \n\nThe pool and jacuzzi area is comfortable, attractive and well maintained.  There is an outdoor eating area just outside the breakfast area.  Its a great area to sit back and feel the relaxing breeze and warmth of Mesa.   There is an exercise room, however, there also is a free shuttle service to a local gym.   This FREE gym was fantastic with all the updated modern exercise equipment.   \n\nFree working WiFi in my room.    There is a business center where I was able to print my schedule for work.  Their is a laundry room.\n\nThe service provided by the employees was top notch.   Melanie, one of the shuttle drivers dropped me off at the local gym.   She knew I had a lobby crew check-in  coming up.  I was distracted exercising at the gym.   She found my number from the front desk and called me to ask if I needed a pick-up back to the hotel.   It was perfect.    \n\nOverall, this is yet another 3 star hotel with 5 star service.
1	Service is non-existent.  Ordered 5 drinks.  Took forever.  A group came in wtih a large dog while we were sitting waiting for our drinks.  The dog was served a bowl of water and a large carrot that he tore up all over the patio while we were stil waiting for our five drinks.  A table next to us had an issue with a bowl of something.  The waiter was holding the bowl in the air.  One of the people in my group asked the waiter what was wrong with it.  The waiter, still holding the bowl, looks over and yells back, there's a hair in it.  We had ordered a couple of sandwhiches.  With the waiter's info, we went up and canceled our order and left.  Good luck to anyone wanting to be served and wanting clean food.
4	"""Arrivederci, a southern Italian enclave in the midst of a strip mall in the desert, can boast the rare designation of a dining choice that was not a compromise candidate between members of my family. Granted, I might have just been weak from the travel, but I was enthusiastic to satiate a hunger difficult to address in my homeland.\n\nI was not disappointed with what we found. An owner who greets patrons with \buena sera!\"""" in a thoroughly non-corporate, warm, mood-lit setting is always a good sign. Many patrons who respond back in Italian and conduct themselves like they're at their second home are an even better sign, even if the restaurant was a bit empty.\n\nThe true test, of course, is the food. No amount of show or neighborhood family feel could compensate for a massive kitchen deficiency. Fortunately, it wasn't required:\n\n- Bread: Uninteresting... except I could drink the accompanying pesto and oil mix.\n- Minestrone (~$5): The lowlight. A case of nothing ventured, nothing gained. Skip it.\n- Gnocchi in pink vodka sauce with salmon (~$19): Let's just say I was highly looking forward to the leftovers as two separate snacks. \n- \""""Choco\""""misu (~$7): Much hullabaloo is made about the addition of the ingredient, but it really just came off as above average tiramisu.\n- Cannoli (~$5): Always ridiculously unhealthy, but here it's made properly with ricotta and the texture is spot on enough to justify it.\n\nArrivederci is an excellent \""""corner\"""" restaurant in a land lacking a bit in both deviance and corners. More importantly, it clearly passes the \""""would survive in NJ as-is\"""" test. There is nothing left to say."""""""
3	Is it a get your drink on and flirt your a$$ off, because you look damn good tonight or is it a fine dining establishment...?  Well, it is definitely the former but fine dining, mmmm, not so much. \n\nOn the bar, seen and be seen crowd, it is awesome. Dress to the nines because it feels like Vegas ladies. People look fabulous and you can people watch all night and not be bored. The drinks are stiff, damn expensive and well worth it. \n\nThe food...Denny's sous chef was cooking the night I was eating and was doing a less than slamfastic job. We had the calamari and it was deep fried and resembled calamari in shape only. I had the bacon wrapped pork and was extremely unimpressed. The bacon was thin and slim. The sauce was dark, syrupy and had no particular taste. The ceasar salad was pure Denny's. Cut pieces of iceberg lettuce with a mayo dressing and big croutons.  Strangly, marscapone cheese was  a common ingredient in many dishes, the sauces and the soup. Given marscapone's bland taste, I didn't find adding it to entrees that innovative or interesting. So, get dressed up, get your drink on, but given the location, the Scottsdale restaurant scene is your oyster, so dine elsewhere.

4	True - they don't serve meat. True - the lunch buffet is reasonably priced and darn good. Have eaten here several times. Dishes change everytime I have been. Not a huge selection, but I left full and quite happy.\n\nNoticed a bunch of comments on the service. My experience has been that the service is fine. I would not call it stunning, but it is lunch buffet after all. My needs were fairly low - water and some bread. The servers have always been helpful in explaining what everything is when I have asked. \n\nN*joy
2	There aren't many Mexican buffet restaurants in phoenix. Maybe because Mexican food is best served fresh. I remember the 1st time my boyfriend took me to Panchos; he remembered eating there when he was younger & wanted to go back.  The salsa isn't very good; it's bland for a Mexican place. We have gone back many times and I must admit that it has gotten worse & worse every time. The food selection has gotten worse & the price higher. We also saw them on the dirty dinning report & they got a horrible rating and neither of us was surprised. It's sad, such a great Idea & good location could have done allot better!
2	I had very high expectations for this place since I had heard so many good things about it before coming so I was pretty disappointed since my experiences definitely were nothing to get overly excited about. \n\nI went the first time with a friend who had the ahi sliders which I have to say were quite good. I had ordered one of their pizzas which was OK but pretty average. I just chalked this up to this restaurant not really being the best place to order pizza. \n\nThe next time I went, I thought, I'll get the ahi sliders since they were so tasty last time. Well, this time was completely the opposite. The tuna had a much fishier smell this time and the bun was all soggy. It seemed like the sandwich had been sitting out for awhile before I even got it. It was so bad I could only manage to eat half a slider. I was considering sending my order back but no one ever asked me if I liked my food. By the time someone had come by to check up on us, I had already resigned myself to the fact that I was going to have to eat a snack once I got home.\n\nOn a side note, the sliders came with sweet potato hash as a side. When I asked if I could substitute the side, I was told that I could only have the kale salad. This didn't really make sense to me since even though there were several other sides that were the same price as the sweet potato hash, I was told that these weren't available as substitutions. The worst part about it was I ended up getting the kale salad and it was so garlicky that I could hardly eat that either.\n\nToo bad... I like the idea of healthy, fresh food but not at the expense of flavor and mediocre service.
5	Believe the hype.\n\nBe prepared to wait.  The first two hours will go by fast if you indulge in Bar Bianco next door.  Bring something to entertain yourself for the last two hours while nursing your aching, empty belly while you hallucinate and think the hostess is calling your name every time she steps out.\n\nMake friends with everyone around you if necessary, if you must gripe about the wait time.  (Seriously, what's with all the whiners?  Didn't you come here KNOWING about the wait time?!  What were you expecting?)\n\nRicotta lovers, get the Biancoverde, which is topped with loads of arugula, fresh mozz, and a gratuitous serving of ricotta.

5	After spending eleven hours in the car driving the last thing I wanted to do is go out for dinner. Tommy V's was directly across the street from our hotel and was convenient to our needs so that's how we choose Tommy V's. I got to tell you this place has got some of the best service I have ever had, and that is a hard rating to get from me considering how I was feeling that night. Everything was cooked to perfection, had wonderful flavor. I can tell you that we did not make it easy on them either, my wife and I split everything during this meal and they split everything to perfection and without complaint. This place went above and beyond to accommodate us, I went from beyond grumpy to relaxed and pleased when we left. My wife and I split the the Pasta Trio and a Romaine Wedge salad, everything came on two separate plates and and I am sure they bumped up the portions sizes to accommodate us splitting the plates. The Pasta Trio had wonderful flavor and texture, the wild mushroom ravioli was my favorite. They had a fantastic little jazz band trio playing, I just fell in love with this place, lots of room, not too load, great ambiance, and fantastic service.
4	"""Great new spot in old town. My first visit was a preview event and things were a little rough, but since then, this place has really delivered. \n\nI dislike the term \mixologist\"""" but I do appreciate artfully crafted cocktails and CPH has that. The drink menu is unique and offers a good variety of different tastes. Plus, the bartenders are always helpful and friendly. The bar, which really is the center piece of the restaurant, is a great spot for a pre-dinner, post-dinner, or pre-pre drink. \n\nThe food is also winning. The pork belly pastrami is amazing, the green lip mussels are good and equally unique. For entrees, you can't go wrong with the short ribs, may be the best in town. \n\nFinally, service is great, another hard find in Phoenix. Hopefully, CPH is continuing the trend of FNB and other places that focus on quality and service, versus table turn over and mass appeal."""""""
5	"""People often comment that various Social Media outlets are a waste of time, brain power and lead to a loss of workplace productivity. For me, sites like Twitter and Facebook are a way to connect with like minded people and stay up to date on news and current events. For the Dwivedi family, Social media turned out to be a lifesaver.\n\nLast night FnB Restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale hosted the \Tiny Fab Kidney Fund\"""" late night dinner service to benefit Amy Donohue & The Dwivedi family.  Before getting to the food, a little background on the event. A decade ago, Anu Dwivedi was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. Six months ago, her kidney function down to twenty percent, she was told the transplant waiting list was up to six years long. (not a prospect that brought comfort to her family).\n\nAnu's foodie daughter Kirti decided to put her social media obsession to use via Facebook with a page she created titled \""""Kidney disease and my tiny mother,\"""" to learn and share her family's experience.\nAmy Donohue saw the page and decided she could help. She contacted Kirti, got the required tests done and the rest as they say, is history (or will be in the coming weeks when the transplant surgery is done).\n\nIn addition to the inspired cuisine FnB is becoming famous for, Chef Charlene Badman whipped up a few Indian inspired dishes in honor of the Dwivedi's. (half of all revenue from food & beverage from 10PM on + 100 percent of the proceeds of a silent auction totaling approximately $1300 went to the Tiny Fab Kidney Fund).\n\nOn to the nights food! My appetizer consisted of lightly battered, perfectly fried rock shrimp ($13) served with a well balanced jalape\u00f1o tartar sauce (with a hint of Meyer lemon and fresh herbs).\n\nAlongside my rock shrimp was a heaping serving of three varieties of cauliflower , tossed with spanish peanuts, marinated in fish sauce and mint whose soft insides were perfectly complemented by their deep fried crunch. (this dish is simply delicious!)\n\nNext up were a pair of Samosas ($5) filled with creamy sweet potato and accompanied by a small bit of sweet, tangy dipping sauce who's components slip my mind (Blogger/foodie foul).\n\nGrilled spicy broccoli ($8) with pistachio and Meyer lemon aioli is flat out the best thing to ever happen to that humble green vegetable (its because of this dish that I know when broccoli season is).\n\nA piping hot serving of traditional Punjabi Butter chicken (Makhan Wala Murgh) served over Basmati rice rounded out my meal. (I imagine this type of curry to be comfort food in Punjab).\n\nIf I had one complaint about the butter chicken it's that I feel the sauce to rice ratio could have been better. The rich, creamy sauce definitely would have benefitted from more rice in my opinion but the flavors were great.\n\nSo then, social media is informative, recreational and the bane of workplace performance but you never know, someday it could very well save your life or that of someone you love.\n\nSide note: If you have ever wondered what it's like to experience true hospitality, make a reservation at FnB. Co-owner and front of house manager Pavle Milic is a study in graciousness, sincerity, service and will make you feel as welcome as anywhere you've ever been."""""""
2	"""This place works best as a sports bar than a restaurant. They did try to sit us away from the bar and loud TVs but still could hear it. The menu has the expected variety, nothing out of the ordinary. A word of caution, their concept of spicy can be different from yours if you are not used to hot food...what they would call a \1-star\"""" probably was a \""""3\"""" for me. Our waitress was very nice and, I have to admit I feel a bit guilty about my low score...I quite can't pinpoint why but it was not a memorable experience. Not horrendous, but not quite good either. Maybe I expect more of a Mexican restaurant in Arizona."""""""
4	"""Kathryn, my girlfriend, loves True Food kitchen and I am a skeptic of anything done by the FOX group especially when it aligns itself to a single philophers idea of eating well, in this case Dr. Weil. I am also a pretty critical person and enjoy critiquing most everything especially eatieries and restaurants.\n\nOne issue we have is that we are Vegans and while they do have a number of items listed as Vegan on the menu there are a few things that just seem silly. The first one is that they have no Salads listed as Vegan and the second is that they do not offer Vegan Mayo. The last time we mentioned the Mayo thing our server gave us a reason why they didnt but that we are welcome to bring our own in.\n\nToday has been a fun day so I thought going to True Food would be a good treat for Kathryn and maybe distract me from other events occuring recently. Our server, Chris, has waited on us before and is always very nice. When we mentioned the Soy Mayo thing she offered to go talk to the chef and managers. When she returned the reply was that \at some point we have to draw the line.\"""" To which I explained that by offering Vegan/Soy Mayo they would lower costs, increase shelf life, and even start substituting it with real Mayo without anyone noticing. She thought these were valid enough and again went to talk with the chef and managers. To which Kathryn and I exchanged glances and began eating our soup.\n\nTo our surprise our next visitor was none other than Michael Stebner the Executive Chef of the restaurant. We began a 10 minute conversation about their philosophy and methodology for creating the menu. He explained that they are not a health food restaurant but rather a restaurant with a health focus. He also pointed out that they are happy to modify anything on the menu to accomodate a number of eating requirements. This was really cool stuff.\n\nHe then went further and talked about his history as a chef and what he has seen work and not work from a practical perspective. This was a real conversation and I appreciate his engagement with us both. At no time was he demeaning to us and he never brushed a point of ours off. While I disagree with the philosophy of their menu I respect their methodology and see that they are interested in doing something more than just sell as much food as possible.\n\nOverall this was a great experience and while it did not result in everything I wanted I am more than happy to refer anyone to eat here and will be back again!"""""""
5	Whoa.  I am positively blown away by the epicurean fantasy I experienced last weekend.  The food was radically exquisite.  There are plenty of lovely reviews below describing its magnificence, so I am actually going to spare you the repetition.  I can't stress to you enough how fresh and high-quality the ingredients were, and how artfully balanced the unique flavors were paired.  I wish I was an exceptional writer to be able to convey the magic that is Nobuo, but you'll just have to take my word for it.  To top it off, the service was excellent.  Chef interacted with us, servers were efficient but not overbearing, Ma\u00eetre D polite and professional.\n\nMy favorite food is pizza, but as I was enjoying the splendor of this brilliant meal I couldn't help but laugh as I looked outside at the hordes of people waiting 3 hours for cheese and dough across the way at Bianco.\n\nNobuo, you are exquisite.
4	I stayed at the Wyndham hotel and this restaurant was within walking distance. It is also the only Asian restaurant I actually wanted to try here in Phoenix. I ordered the Drunken noodles and I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was! I choose medium spicy and it came out just right. The portion size is huge and they weren't stingy about the vegetables or meat. My only complaint is that the meat tasted a bit overdone but overall I really like this place!
3	We drove 38 miles to meet our friends for dinner. They recommended this pizza restaurant. We ordered the House Salad without red peppers and onions. And we each ordered a personal pizza. The idea behind the way you order pizza is pretty smart for the business but not for your wallet. I ordered the pizza with the red sauce, Italian sausage, mushrooms and anchovies. The large house salad had the oil and vinegar dressing. It was just the right amount for four people. The pizza was tasty, but for $16, I thought it was a bit pricey. We split the bill which came to $60 per couple. The wives had a glass of wine and us guys had lemonade, four personal pizzas, 1 coffee and their peanut butter cup cheesecake, But HEY...we enjoyed ourselves.
4	Now this is what I'm talking about. After investigating the neighborhood a bit, I found my supermarket. It is located a bit down the road, but it is well worth the trek. It is a nice, new, clean, well lit and planned lot and store, adjacent to other cool shops. My initial reaction when I walked in the automatic sliding doors is that this is just like the Ralph's Fresh Fare market I frequented in Southern California. I found the aisles to be intuitive and user-friendly stocked, with good prices and fresh produce. The only thing that kept it from being a five-starrer would be that my phone number did not activate my Fry's club discount yet (it has been 4 days since I activated) and the checkout registers did not seem to be fully staffed, so there was a bit of a wait. Overall, a great place to pick up groceries.
4	Safeway is one of my farovite places to buy groceries if I need good stuff reasonably.  IF I need anything out of the ordinary, I may go to Albertson's or AJ's ~ but my weekly shop if usually spend at the Safeway at Val Vista and Elliott. It's clean and the staff is helpful and friendly. Plus their vegetable selection is pretty darn good, too.\n\nToday I did a big shop for a family birthday party we were having ~ everything I needed was right there, including THEE most delicious birthday cake.  At the end of the night my guest wanted to know where I got the cake it was so good ~ it was hard for my guests to believe I got such a wonderfully tasting cake at Safeway . . . but I did.\n\nIt is a blessing to have a nice grocery store near by, with reasonable prices and a great internal bakery.\n\nBlessings\n: )KC
4	This is one of the very few chain restaurants I like...\n\nTried this new location on Saturday night (they recently moved into a new bigger building next door). \n\nMelting Pot is an adventure in dining, a prolonged multi-hour dinner experience. I love fondue, and The Melting Pot are the masters of fondue!\n\nStarted with cheese, apples, breads, and veggies with a cheddar cheese and beer concoction. Moved on to lobster, shrimp, steak, pork, and chicken which we cooked in a veggie broth. Finished the meal with a chocolate and peanut butter dip with cheesecake, strawberries, and rice crispy treats.\n\nGreat service, great food, great wine list, great times!
4	A 4 star pizza place in Phoenix?  About as common as swimming pools or sun tans, right??  Seriously, this is 4 stars for a couple of reasons.\n\n*Food*\nDecent food.  Not incredibly innovative, but still more ambitious than the rest.   I especially like their sausage and caramelized onion pizza, or the pepperoni with crimini mushroom pizza.  Also, the wines by the glass are surprisingly well picked and easy on the wallet.  Make sure to try the spinach, pancetta and goat cheese salad.  It's really tasty.  I asked the staff what kind of dressing they used and they gave me a printed recipe.  Cool eh?  I am curious about the pasta and panini - haven't had them yet.\n\n*Value*\nCan't be beat.  For what little you pay, you get the better end of the deal at Sauce.  For a while there, they were doing a $20 special for a 12 inch pizza, salad and two glasses of wine.   That, my friends is a steal, and why this place gets four stars.\n\nP.S. I think this place can best be described as an atmosphere similar to Paradise Bakery or Pei Wei as someone said below.
1	I brought my dog here to get neutered. When I went  to get him, his right eye seemed irritated and barely kept it open. Being new to this, I thought it was because he was on anesthesia and maybe it'll go away. Couple days later, it was just as bad. They referred me to an animal hospital. My visit cost $80 including ointments.  He got a cornea ulcer which the new Vet said could have happened at the neuter clinic.  Afterwards I called the clinic to see if they could consider compensation since this could have been prevented at the clinic. The doctor immediately got defensive and argued back saying it happened before I brought him in. NOT TRUE. I was being calm and he finally agreed to pay half. He never did send anything. These people did not take responsibility. I will not bring my dog back and advise everyone else NOT to. Terrible customer service.
4	First time customer, today.  The visit was for:  Separation anxiety, which had prompted 3 broken teeth and irritable bowel; anal gland expelling, and general checkup/shots.  \n\nFirst, let me say that I did not wait at all.  I walked in two minutes before my appointment time, and barely sat down in the waiting room before being shown into the quaint exam room (adorable copper sink and fixtures.... Kudos for the charm.  However, the charm has nothing to do with my rating).  The room and waiting area are clean and simply decorated. \n\nThe vet tech asked the questions that she needed to, filled in the information that she needed, and I saw Dr. Holmes within five minutes of my arrival.  I was glad to learn that he is easy-going, but listens to my concerns and provides several options for the harder to deal with issues.  Both the vet tech and Dr. Holmes had a friendly demeanor, while maintaining a professional atmosphere.  They had a good way with my Miles, though he's pretty easygoing as long as there are people around.\n\nDr. Holmes asked all of the questions that I expect to be asked when I bring a dog in for separation anxiety.  I've fought putting Miles on meds for years, and have finally relented that, when I had an anxiety issue, you better believe that I took something for it.  Dr. Holmes' questions lead me to believe that he thinks similarly, with meds as a last resort.  For me, I walk my dog 4 miles before kenneling him, which he chews and destroys, injuring himself in the meantime.  I need to get him through the moving transition, and hope to wean him off at a later date, when he is more used to his new surroundings.\n\nFor the teeth: he didn't rush or push me into an expensive treatment, and told me that many dogs have no problems after broken teeth.  Yes, many do, but waiting to see what happens will not be an awful decision, though we can schedule a root canal or other major treatment if I'd like to go ahead and do that (I chose to wait, since Miles needs a cleaning in December, and we'll know more about whether or not he will truly need the stumps to be removed).  They gave me a quote for the teeth cleaning, low end (no removal) and high end (removal) that ranged from 530-720; this is close to what I am used to paying for teeth cleaning, on the low end, and I've not had to do removals before, so I imagine that the high end is on par as well.  \n\nAll-in-all, I think I'm happy.  The only reason for 4 stars is the lack of a pharmacy on site.  They have a lot of the things, but the sedative and prozac I have to get off site; this may be an AZ pharmacy law thing, I don't know.  It's a pain, but not ridiculous.
1	So we come from California where there is a lot of sushi to choose from and it is my favorite food so I have been searching for good sushi here this is not the place.\n\nAnyways the small amount of fish in my roll and the horrible service did not satisfy my craving and I will never go back it was like a sushi bar that was trying to be a dance club and the waiters were all very distracted by that. They never refilled our drinks anyways I finally found the perfect sushi place ill write a review for them later :)
2	I thought the customer service when placing my order tonight was pretty good. The guy was quick to the point and personable - no complaints there. My order was correct and on time. Kudos for that.\n\nThe food. Wow, lets talk about that. My house salad was fine, better than most pizza places that usually just give you hunks of iceberg and quartered tomatoes like they couldn't care less. My salad had baby reds, arugula, and fresh romaine. Extra points for that. The pizza, however... what happened there? The first thing we immediately noticed was that the sauce on our standard cheese pizza was extremely watery and flavorless. I have never experienced sauce so watery and it made the entire pizza a soupy mess. Despite this, we were really hungry, so I said screw it and had a slice. I wish I hadn't, because now my stomach is paying for it as we speak. \n\nI was also disappointed that the spinach that I asked for on our pizza was nothing like the spinach that I'm used to enjoying on top of their white pizza. Instead we received whole leaves of spinach that were toasted to an unenjoyable, also flavorless crisp. \n\nTo be fair, I realize that when it comes to chain restaurants some locations are better than others, and I also realize that this one just recently opened. Still, I just can't excuse a pizza (and not a very cheap one at that) that could be so bad. Hopefully things improve over the next month or so, but maybe I'll stick with the Camelback location.\n\n\nEdit: To the people (presumably employees or friends of) that are leaving fake five star reviews - stop it. It's dishonest, deceptive, and incredibly obvious.
5	Camarones aguachile are aweeeeeeeeeeeeeesome!!!\n\nI love this place if you like seafood and Mexican food then look no further this place is the bomb.  The service is good, they have great drinks alcoholic and non, and the food is amazing.  Plus the ceviche tostada for free at the beginning along with chips and salsa just tops off how wonderful this place is.  \n\nI admit it is pricey but the ingredients are fresh and we are in the desert so you gotta pay for good stuff and this place is for sure worth it.
5	I can't say enough great things about the Tuck Shop!  I have been there a handful of times and every time they are gracious and inviting.  A few of those occasions I have been with a group of people and we always get loud and rowdy.  But I never feel like we need to calm down.  The owner and servers always remember me which make me feel oh so special!  The menu changes quite frequently but my absolute favorites, cheese curds and the skirt steak are staples that never change.  I am actually heating up my left over tomato casserole right now!  If you go on the night where the special is fish and chips, do not hesitate, order them.  The best fish and chips I have ever had.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them...
5	Food-frickin-gasm! \n\nWas on a business trip, had one night in Phoenix, one meal, wanted it to be memorable. Researched heavily on Yelp and Triple D and came down to this one little Italian restaurant.\n\nWork friend and I agreed we had to try the two dishes highlighted on DDD; 5 meat bolognese with homemade pasta and Osso Bucco. First started with a salad with fresh mozzarella, pesto, tomatoes, basil. Wow it was so fresh, so amazing. The waiter suggested we get the bolognese sauce with a special homeade pasta that was filled with ricotta but yet light and airy and smaller than a penne but not hollow. Very unique softness to it and it was just incredible with this meat sauce. \n\nSecond I have to say I would not typically order osso bucco but since it was highlighted on the show as a melt in your mouth good, I couldn't resist. This night it was made with veal shank. This was three huge veal shanks that filled the entire plate with a homeade lingini pasta with ruffled edges like lasagna noodles and this wonderful dark rich tomato/wine flavor sauce that was just amazing by itself. Wow you literally did not have to chew this meat and I am not exaggerating! \n\nWe were just awestruck over the flavors of these dishes, the cozy environment and the amazing friendliness of the restaurant. The owner came over several times to ask us how we liked it and we both were so impressed with the customer service overall.\n\nTo top it off, our amazing waiter was nice enough to save us the last caramel gelato with praline pecans crunched up small, OMG so smooth, sweet and perfect! I cannot wait to bring my other work associates here when I come back to Phoenix in a couple of weeks!
5	I have never loved tacos. This place changed my mind... The quality and size of their tacos surpasses that of America's (Sorry America's Taco Shop lovers) and it adds a strong local cultural vice that other taco shops lack with its Dia de los Muertos themed paintings. The meat is well-marinated (especially the carne asada) and the dozen-plus salsas are each different by tasty and made to perfection. You can spend ten-to-fifteen minutes just sorting through the salsa bar. I am lucky enough to live nearby and I take advantage of the shark tacos on most days :) I am so glad that it's caught on! I know that I will keep coming back!!!
4	"""I have been hearing about this place for a while and finally decided to give a try.  Very cozy and warm environment.. The staff were very nice and accommodating. \nThey do serve a bowl of rice soup with chicken at the beginning of all courses, had a good flavor and reminded me of a Chinese soup, \chow\""""\nI tried the yellow curry, with deep fried tofu, the curry has unbelievable flavor indicating it's been prepared well.  I would like smaller chunks of tofu.  The only problem was that the potatoes were not cooked thoroughly..\nI hate hard/half cooked vegetables.\nI also tried the coconut soup, which hands one of the best one I have tried... I did ask for Thai hot.. which was borderline spicy.\nOverall I recommend this place, one of the more authentic Thai restaurant in the valley and the location."""""""
3	"""It's been a while since I've had Smashburger and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it, but I remember my experience.  \n\nI think if their whole concept and even store name revolves around the word \Smash\"""", they should design their store to reflect that.  SHOW US THE SMASHING!!!  Five Guys & In-N-Out, who I would place together in the same category as Smashburger, both have exposed kitchens showing us how clean and freshly prepared their food is.  \n\nNext, their burgers are really really greasy.  I think the best beef to fat ratio for a patty is 80/20.  I don't know what their ratios are, but just because they use 100% Angus beef, it shouldn't equate to more grease.  It should equate to more flavor.   And their 'highest-quality-cheeses\"""" wasn't anything special.   And I really really tasted.  I really did.\n\nTheir rosemary/olive oil fries adds another couple of bucks to your meal, which is north of 10$ dollars for a meal.  They're not as good as they sound.  Next time, I'll stick with the regular fries.  \n\nI will go back to try again, but so far, Smashburger is just 2 1/2 stars in my book.  The rounding-up because I'm just nice. :D"""""""
5	"""I took my husband here for his birthday.  We both love barbeque and our favorite rib place has gone out of business in Arizona, so at the recommendation of a friend we decided to try Texas Roadhouse instead.  It was a Friday night and we had to wait for about 45 minutes.  In the waiting room they offer peanuts to munch on while you wait, and everyone just throws the peanut shells all over the floor.  So don't be shocked by the atmosphere.  I\m not a peanut fan and it made me feel a little uncomfortable crunching on peanut shells as I walked, but my husband loved it.  \n\nThe food, though... the food won me over.  SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!  We will definitely be eating there again.  I can easily say this is our new favorite restaurant!  \n\nIt was funny, too.  When they found out it was my husband's birthday, they made him sit on a saddle and sang to him, and brought him a complimentary dessert.  I laughed and laughed at that!  (Remind me never to go there on my birthday! LOL)\n\nMy only complaint is that the table that we sat at had no light overhead and was pretty dark.  It was pretty busy, though, and our waitress was great!  And the food is worth the cost of peanut shells stuck to my shoes.  Oh man, that food was good!"""""""
5	I love Lo-Fi!   This is definitely my new favorite place to hang out in Mesa.  \nPlenty of seating for me and my friends, and you don't feel rushed or uncomfortable or that you're giving money to the devil for sub-par drinks, like at *bux.   \nThey had a special- lattes for $2 the other night... I can't remember the last time i got coffee so cheap.  The iced teas are my favorite though.   Plus the guy who's always working there, Sam, once brought my friend a cup of ice water when he noticed she didn't order a drink... how thoughtful! \nThanks for keeping us all hydrated :)      \n\nAlso - Vegan baked goods = thumbs up.. I'm not vegan but this chocolate cookie with peanut butter inside was so awesome!\n\nMy friend said the biscotti is great as well.
5	5 stars? For a sub shop? Yup, absolutely! Subway feels like an  assembly line compared to this place. Fresh rolls, all the cold cuts are prepared and sliced as you wait. Even the olives were really good, and I'm a bit of an olive snob. \n\nI had the footlong tuna on whole wheat. The tuna was really fresh and it was a generous helping as well. Great pepper jack cheese that had a nice kick to it. I got it to go but I took a quick look around the inside and it looked clean and inviting. They had a TV mounted on the wall that had some sports playing. It had kind of a family diner feel to it. \n\nOn Sundays, any footlong cold sub is only $3.95. $3.95!!! I've paid that for a greasy pizza slice. For the same amount here you can get a delicious, fresh and healthy meal. \n\nI can see this place being on the regular Sunday lunch rotation. Besides, it's a local business so why not support them? Give it a shot...highly recommended!
3	Ah, MADCAP. You took over a theater I enjoyed attending when I lived on that side of town. Back then, I was much younger and could assimilate into the Mill Avenue crowd. These days, and all I see are punks and hooligans up to no good. When did I become so old?\n\nIt was a little sad walking in for their Grindhouse Redux showing of *The Evil Dead* and *The Hills Have Eyes II* this past Saturday. The ticket costs $8 for both or $8 for either one. So, if you get there on time, you can watch two movies for the low, low price of $8. Add in a large popcorn and bottle of soda for $5, and you have a nice little date with yourself.\n\nThe actual theater could use a bit of work: Shampoo the seats, power wash the floors, Febreze the walls. It smells like old shoes in there. Which actually would work to your advantage if you'd trying to break up with someone and you want them to initiate it so you're off the hook and look like the better person. Really, I have to think these things up!\n\nI almost needed a guide to get me to the right theater because none of them seem to be properly marked.\n\nAlthough the theater wasn't filled  to even 50% capacity, they were a spirited crowd and they helped to inflate my rating (otherwise, it would have been a solid 1.27 stars).\n\nApparently, their Facebook account is more accurate than the offical website. But since I don't Facebook, this doesn't do me any good. But, overall, I had a good time and probably wouldn't have experienced this location if not for the event I was attending Saturday. Because it actually started at 8, I was out of the theater 2 hours earlier than I anticipated. Early enough to be thoroughly revolted by the shenanigans of the ASU crowd and their deplorable behavior. \n\nThis is Grampy Bacon signing off.
4	"""Anyone who knows bbq, knows Joe's.  You can't miss it.  It's the original neon sign in downtown gilbert, with the arrow, and tempting reminder to \Eat at Joe's.\""""  \n\nThey have these amazingly huge baked potatoes...big enough that I wonder what they feed those suckers to make then a pound or more each.  I easily get two or three meals out of each one, and nothing beats a left over potato from Joe's, trust me.  Get it with meat on top.  The turkey breast is always spot on, and the turkey jalepeno sausage is awesome.  Once you get your tater, make sure to load up on the extras, like bbq sauce, (regular or spicy), marinated onions, and mild & spicy peppers.  You'll want to make sure you get extra for your leftovers.  No normal person can finish that potato, especially with meat on top.  I know everyone talks about the ribs, but trust me, the tater is where it's at.    \n\nI do have to dock a star for a cheese issue.  For whatever reason, they've gotten super stingy with the cheese lately.  If you're going to give me a loaded baked potato the size of my head, atleast put more than 2 shreds of cheese on it."""""""
2	"""This place is OPEN. We had our pics done today. Been here once before for family christmas photos, it was OK then but a little expensive, and they've gotten more expensive since then. $90+ after tax for 8 sheets, and that doesn't include a CD with the JPGs. The girl completely jacked up the first twenty or so photos - she didn't have the lighting done properly so all the best shots of our session turned out too dark! It was a digital camera - is there ANY good reason at all that we couldn't see each photo on screen a second after it was taken so we knew that it was stuffed up? No, we found out later when going through the \discard pile\"""" on the computer with an admittedly very helpful Michelle. I'm also not particularly impressed with the photo borders they have on offer. A little too expensive for what you get, but the lack of photographic competency is inexcusable and we had to settle for second-choice pics since there's no way I was going to come back and do over again - wearing a collared shirt once a year is way enough for me thanks. Also, for some strange reason they kept calling my wife over the last week, like three or four times, leaving voicemails etc confirming our appointment and wanting to talk about \""""seating\"""". My wife returned two of the calls, the second time she was like \""""what the hell is so important that you guys keep calling me??\"""" The woman was like \""""Um, I don't really know.. you're the only guys in at that time slot and there doesn't look like there's a problem?!\"""" Seriously, WTF.

4	"""The first time I stepped foot into Lucy, I felt like a kid in a candy store... Since then, I've been on numerous occasions and spent a fair amount of $$ on athletic apparel, gym bags, socks, gift cards, and more.  The people that work at the store are friendly and the store has a good energy about it.  All of that being said, I am taking off a star because I think the selection at Lucy has gone downhill a bit!\n\nDear Lucy:\nYou used to carry many more name brands including Nike, Splendid, OmGirl, and Reef.  Now it seems that the majority of your products are the lucy line.  That is fine, but I miss the selection and quality of the other lines!  I will say that I am excited to wear the \Lucy power pant\"""" that I recently bought, and that I like the fact that you offer short and tall style pants to choose from.  (Bonus for shorter peeps like me and saves me a trip to Jose your Tailor to get alterations!)  In any case, I do love you Lucy, but I'm hoping you'll bring back some of those other lines... until then, it's only 4 stars!\n\nOn a serious note, Lucy is a great place to shop for active wear... and their gift cards make great presents!"""""""
2	Noticed the great reviews here on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  Most of the reviews are for the pizza which we did not try.  We came in for pasta dinners.  \n\nThe restaurant is a smaller storefront in a strip center just south of Bell Rd.  This seems to be mostly a pizza take-out restaurant.  There are about six or eight tables and Italian theme decor.  You can bring your own wine or beer without charge - this is a great service to diners.  They furnish wine glasses.  \n\nThe owner and staff are friendly and seem anxious to please.  Our pasta dinners were overcooked, dry and lacked real flavor.  We will come back and try the pizza.
5	Not only are their bagels delicious, but they have THE BEST COFFEE in the valley, hands down.  Add a touch of cream and a little sweetener to their hazelnut vanilla brew or their breakfast blend for a slightly less sweeter version and it's practically HEAVEN in cup.  I'm not kidding.  I am a serious coffee drinker (couldn't tell ,could you?) and I am very picky.  So picky that before I discovered Lox, I would only drink the coffee that I made for myself at home because no one else's was good enough.  However, now that I have had the glorious coffee from Lox Stock & Bagel even my own coffee doesn't measure up.  I literally stop by and pick up a cup from there almost every day. YUMMMM!
5	Sake Bombs a must... Packed Friday night out on the patio, and the menu had something for everyone's palate! Portions were pretty big.  Loved my Yamada Roll! Spicy drizzle of sauce over the roll, crab meat was sweet, and I was comfortably full on this soy wrapped roll. Friends enjoyed their steak and potatoes, flatbread pizzas and shrimp appetizers. Staff was attentive for the most part.  In addition to the great food, their ambiance and  our company hosting our visit to AZ really made it so that we enjoyed ourselves!
5	I ate here for the first time the other day. I was a bit nervous that it'd be busy because it was a Sunday morning but there were still spots in their baby parking lot. Their drive thru is poorly placed for other drivers trying to park but their ordering system makes the line go pretty quickly. My friend and I ate on the patio. They was plenty of seating outside but little seating inside. The food and drinks were great! I had a breakfast croissant sandwich and an orange glorious smoothie. \n\nAll in all the restaurant is appropriately named. The food and drinks are indeed d'lish.
3	I've been going to Warner Family Practice for a few years and have many different experiences here. Some great, some not so great and some just plain awful. My only advice is see the Dr. and get to the route of the problem rather than the nurse practitioner. I've found in the past I've had to have several appointments if I didn't see the Dr. ...big waist of time and money for everyone involved.\n\nReally the only bad thing I'll say is sometime the front desk staff are a bit moody and don't seem to want to deal with you. I know it must be tough dealing with people all day long but maybe pretend you like us. :)
1	Worst. Coffee-related. Experience. Ever. \n\nI will say, the beverages were pretty good, not awe-inspiring but good. \n\nBut the service sucked. \n\nIt was my first time there and I wasn't sure what I wanted but had been sent with drink orders from some friends. It started poorly. I stood at the counter for several minutes without a single person either before or after me and was not so much as greeted. I've worked in a cafe and that should just not ever happen. If they can greet you over the heads of 30 travelers at an airport Starbucks, I should at least be able to get a hello at a desolate cafe. \n\nSecond, there was no tea on their menu so I finally asked the dude behind the counter about ordering I asked him about a tea order for my compadre. He looked at a paper behind the register, told me what I was looking for existed and rang me up for it. \n\nI guess my biggest complaint is the tone of condescension that was present from the time I opened the door to the time I left. Even the 4 middle-aged patrons looked at me like I wasn't trendy enough to be there. I may not have a snazzy haircut or be walking in with a fancy mac book but I am still intelligent enough to pick up on attitude and, as far as I know, my money is just as good as anyone else's. \n\nI will absolutely never go to this location again.
2	"""Let me preface this by saying that I've never been a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants. My sister loves Macayo's for some mysterious reason, and I decided to play along since we had relatives visiting from out of state.\n\nThe decor is nauseating. It feels like they took the most obnoxious colors they could find and ratcheted it up on the scale of tacky. However, we came to eat, so who cares what color the walls are?\n\nThe salsa is thin, but tolerable. Nothing special, but I'm always a fan of bottomless chips, so I'll take it.\n\nEveryone else seemed to like their food. I ordered tamales with green sauce. Unfortunately, the first time it came with their \Baja sauce,\"""" which our waitress informed us is cream cheese, heavy whipping cream and jalape\u00f1o juice. She quickly took it back and brought out my correct order. Much to my surprise, green sauce is just red sauce with green chiles in it. At this point, I had fallen behind enough that I scraped most of the sauce to the side and ate my lunch. The tamales had a nice fluffy texture, but the sauce was not what I had in mind.\n\nOur waitress did handle my sending back the order without any fuss. She was gracious and attentive, so for that I'm adding in an extra star."""""""
1	So let me preface this one star with the fact that we never did eat here. The reason is because despite the fact that the website says they close at 9:30 on Saturday, they actually were closed by 8:00 when we went there....TWICE! Note to Au Petit Four, this is 2011 and either update your website or inform people if you close early because it is slow. We drove from Southern Scottsdale to Arcadia and it was a waste of time. Also, waste of groupon money!
5	What an excellent facility this was! I had never been to the symphony or the opera until receiving Yelp tickets to see Faust. The building was larger than I expected, yet easy to navigate. I didn't feel herded like I do trying to move around Gammage. The lights and decor were wonderful and multiple areas to purchase drinks made it easier. Also the availability of restrooms made it much easier than Gammage. We were in the back section of the lower seating and the sound was wonderful. The play was in French, but a nice display provided subtitles so that we could follow along. I would definitely go back to see either the symphony or another opera. It was a great evening out! Parking was also convenient in a nearby parking deck ($12).
3	Aye chihuahua!\n\nSo I'm mucho hambre and it's Christmas at 10pm on a Sunday. Bad combination for finding food out there. \n\nBut lo, I see a shining beacon. Is it the North Star leading me to the new born Baby Jesus? \n\nNO! It's Eriberto's! Praise the Lord God Almighty!\n\nArriba, arriba!\n\nI had the California burrito which is potato, cheese, pico de gallo and meat. I ate half of it and somehow it changed from burrito to brick somewhere between my mouth and my poor stomach. \n\nWould I return? Um... No.
4	My friends and I hit up the Gelato Spot on my recent visit to Scottsdale and what a perfect way to end the day!\n\nI was waffling between one and two flavors (one being small and two being two scoops/medium) and I finally chose medium because I couldn't pick just one flavor! Calories be damned! I really enjoyed my Toasted Almond and Coconut. YUM. It came with a long cookie which was a nice touch. \n\nYou've gotta know what you want when you get up there. Those ladies like to keep the line moving! They'll let you taste flavors, but they'll help the next person in line while you're deciding.
4	"""Order the Chicken and Waffles. \Oh that's like Lo-Lo's.\"""" No it's not. Stop that right now.\n\nLo-Lo's:Daily Dose = McDonalds:Delux burger. Are both popular? Yes.  Are both selling the same variety of food? Yes. Is the dish at the first establishment consistently better only if the consumer is 100% stoned? Yes. Similarities end there.\n\nThese waffles are actually a cornbread hybrid, topped with green chili, shredded chicken, charred corn stew, a cream sauce, tortilla strips and avocado. (Thank you pagan god of soul food. Thank you.)"""""""
4	Charlie's + Me = Fun fun time!\n\nI've heard some other girls have had issues with not so friendly people there and that some people make comments toward women, but I have never had that problem...nor would I care if I did hear anything, because it would far outweigh the sweeties I HAVE met there.  I know my boys would have my back!\n\nI LOVE LOVE LOVE the drag shows.  I'm not even going to say who my favorites are, because lots of them are absolutely wonderful, and have such sweet personalities to boot.\n\nIn all actuality I feel like I get stared at more by other females than anything else...and I got hit on by some cute gay boys.  Teehee!  They sure know how to make a gal feel purty.\n\nThe bartenders make awesome drinks including massively tasty midori sours...and fair warning - the jello shots are secretly deadly!  Those suckers sneak up on you.\n\nThe chicken crisps are yummy whether you are drunk or not!\n\nThe only negatives are what some others have pointed out already - the purse restriction and the music that doesn't kick up the beat until after 12 or 1.  However, since I never carry a purse with me into any club and I'm too busy watching the drag shows to care what's going on inside (besides which, you can't blame a country-western bar for playing that type of music....), these negatives really don't exist for me anyway.\n\nI've had a blast every time I go, and I can't wait until Halloween!
4	This is by far the toughest hike I've done in the valley.  I wont even consider if I am even a little hung over, or if it's too hot 90+degrees.  But, if the weather is right, and I'm feeling good, watch out!  I'll suffer the whole way, but feel so damn proud when I hit the top.  \n\nAfter you hit the hump, you will need to do some climbing on all fours.. so be ready for it!  Bring gloves if it't hot.
4	I'm giving the Arrogant butcher 4 coveted stars for 2 reasons: first, its hard to find a decent happy hour downtown with $4 glasses of wine, let alone great wine, and these guys have PurVine as the house special.\n\nSecond, as if we were in Paris, they have this delicious mussels appetizer with chunks of sausage and french fries piled on top. Thank whomever the brilliant Frenchman was that thought of this, a true chef d'\u0153uvre awaits\n\nThe only entree i've had here was less than thrilling, the short-rib stew. It came out piping, skin-off the top of your mouth, hot... When ordering short-rib anything I kind of expect...well...short ribs! Not only was this concoction far from tasty (quite bland, really) there was hardly any short rib to speak of, mostly beans, etc. For some unexplainable reason I've ordered this twice with equal disappointment.\n\nThey have some interesting looking daily specials like king crab cioppino on friday that I plan on checking out. I'll let you know.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: See ya there for happy hour
4	This is a great little restaurant.  The staff is very friendly and service was top notch.  They have a lunch buffet, but I opted for Chana Masala ( Chick Pea Curry )  instead for my lunch.  It was very good and a pretty large size portion.  I would recommend it.  I also ordered the Chili Naan ( they have many different kinds ) it's basically Naan covered in Sriracha or some other chili paste.  It was pretty hot so be warned if you order it.  It also had what I thought was kind of a charred back to it, but it went really well with the Chana Masala so I'll go with that it being intentional.\n\nTry:\n- Chana Masala
5	I rarely say holy moly, but holy moly brunch, people. Shared the ahi chipotle citrus bites and the catfish beignets among several people, and both were write-home-about delicious. I had the stuffed french toast all to myself and I'm pretty sure everyone who writes a positive review about stuffed anything makes this joke, but afterwards I was the stuffed one. Luckily everything else I had planned that day involved sitting quietly, digesting and meditating on the meaning of life. The meaning of life on Sunday is good brunch, so the circle was unbroken.
5	"""I was going to write a two word update.\n\nAnd those two words would have been \Tot Cho's\""""...a thoroughly delightful creation that they serve at the Arcadia Tavern...Tater Tots with nacho stuff all over them:) Yeah, that's right...nacho tot's!\n\nThe Beautiful Carin and I beginning to make a nuisance of ourselves here:)\n\nFixtures, denizens, habituates...\n\nThe patio has become a bit of a \""""home away from home\"""" (but with drink's that I don't have to mix myself:)\n\nWe keep showing up:)\n\nLast week, Carin correctly guessed the number of golf balls in the vase in the entryway, and she won us free drinks and food:)\n\nMatt (the owner) is thinking of adopting us (although that would technically make Carin and I brother and sister...both creepy and hot at the same time:)\n\nWe haven't had a bad meal or bad experience yet...tonight they had a Jimmy Buffett (or Boofay, for my friend Ryan) clone , softly playing guitar and singing during happy hour:)\n\nI am happy:)"""""""
3	"""We went here for something most people don't order at a place like Zinc...the mac 'n cheese, which is becoming an increasingly popular item there. I was told it was the best in the valley. It was a great, comforting rendition to be sure, but I've made better myself. My friend ordered the dry packed scallops, which were delicious, but again, nothing to write home about. All in all, it felt a bit like zinc is trying to hard, or just can't decide of it's a quaint cafe/bistro, or wannabe fine dining. This feeling was reinforced by the holier than thou attitudes of the staff, and the very \rushed\"""" vibe we got when dining an hour before closing."""""""
5	Well what can I say about this place?  The restaurant is located in an upscale commercial complex with boutiques and an AJ's in the middle of Arrowhead Ranch.  Definitely doesn't have the boring suburban feel which you get along Bell Road only a mile away.  The inside has exposed brick on the walls with sleek looking seating.  Each food item comes out looking like a self made creation from the chef.  I have to say the Marguerite pizza is one of my favorites.  Having a crispy crust and savory flavors that make my mouth want to eat more, more, and more.  But I don't need to eat more because I fill my mouth with a good wine.  I had  a Dutton Estate Chardonnay(I think) which was half off on this day which kept me happy.  This place did not fail me.\nSo will I be back?  Umm that's a yes!
5	"""BIANCO PIZZA - NOW SERVED HERE FOR DINNER!\n\nYep, the word is slowly dribbling down the mouths of Phoenix foodies that Panne Bianco has now expanded into the old LUX location next door, and they are open for dinner with a limited yet delicious selection of pizza's, salads, and pasta selections. This should be cause for celebration. \n\nI recommend that local fans of the now insanely crowded Pizzeria Bianco downtown make a stop here soon (pizza after 4PM) for some of the best pizza on the planet. Right now, no long 1-2 hour waits to sit down... order a pizza and with 10 min your pie is ready to be lovingly devoured. This is the same dough that made Chris Bianco justifiably famous and a James Beard award winner. Perfectly thin crust, just the right crispness and bite, with Bianco's own sensational tomato sauce (really just hand crushed Bianco DiNapoli plum tomatoes with a hint of basil). The pizza selections here are more limited (I was crushed...no \Wise Guy\""""). \n\nOnce again, Bianco fans should come and get their pizza here soon before the word gets out and the place becomes a crowded scene. \n\nThe decor in the new \""""restaurant\"""" side is tasteful and adorable, with a British/European sensibility and a small number of tables.  \n\nI've been a regular here for many-many years. The sandwiches are always high  on the yummy scale, great vibe, always fresh, one of the best reasons to go downtown.\n\nHighly recommended."""""""
5	With a great selection of beers on tap, always having a fantastic seasonal beer and a wide variety of great food I could go here three or four times a week!  The salmon sandwich is one of my favorites and it goes great with an 8th street ale (which I happen to be drinking now) along with pretty much any other thing they have on tap.  Start with the wings or nachos and you will not be disappointed.  \n\nIt's a great place to watch any sporting event.  A few too many Vikings fans for my liking, being a Bears fan myself but it's a great atmosphere for pretty much any time you're looking to have a memorable experience.
3	Ok, I too bought into all of the hype like everyone else in the east valley. And I am glad I went. I had a great breakfast! I ordered the hawaiian french toast which was amazing! My friend ordered the Chorizo Joe and asked for it in a torilla so they brought a huge burrito in a spinach wrap. We ordered the chocolate chip silver dollar pancakes for my son which he loved. So the breakfast menu was great and we liked what we ordered. There was plenty of seating, very wide and open. Very clean interior. There was a cafe style bar for eating that had a TV. The restaurant was pretty empy though and for being so slow, I can't say the service was better. No one was really overly friendly, with the exception of the cute hostess with the flower in her hair. Everyone else was mediocre at best and didn't seem too thrilled to be there. Unfortunate because I bet it get's really busy at lunch time. We went on a Monday morning about 10 am. Maybe there was a breakfast rush and I missed it? Regardless, I am still wanting to go back another day and try their lunch. It's about time Chandler had a nice upscale, yet casual breakfast lunch restaurant. Now if they could just be a little happier to see you, we'd be golden!
4	We enjoyed our stay at Premier Inn.  The room was about $15 more than we were looking to spend, but was probably about 5 times nicer than places we'd previously stayed in at the price we were after.  All in all, it ended up being like $70 for a HUGE room with parking right outside our door.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  They have a nice lounge, complete with vending machines, along with laundry facilities, a pool, and a hot tub.  We didn't use the latter 3 I mentioned, but would have been great to jump into the water if we weren't in such a hurry.\n\nThe room was clean, the bathroom/shower was nice, and the overall stay at the hotel was a positive one.  Definitely recommend this place, especially for the price.
4	"""You know a place is good when you come on a Wednesday night, at 8pm (1 hour before closing), and there's a 30 minute wait, and the restaurant is packed!\n\nIt was sure worth the wait though! A waitress said the dessert was \To Die For\"""". And she wasn't kidding! \n\nThe food is very natural, unique, and very healthy. You can tell the makers put a lot of thought in finding the right spices and flavors in creating healthy choice dishes. \n\nWe had: \nHouse Smoked Salmon. Rating: 4.5/5\nEdamame Dumplings.

1	"""I'm not even going to waste any witty rhetoric on this place. It goes down in my dining history as THE worst restaurant experience ever. I should have known while waiting for a table that this is NOT a mexican restaurant - the first hint being the annoying techo-pop music.\n My second observation told me that this is simply a Scottsdale singles bar and the crowd just moved north from the defunct Pink Taco - not exactly a room full of culinary experts.\n Ambience: Cold and bare decor ( they probably refer to it as \contemporary\""""), enormously loud, bachelorette parties, etc. Waiter lost our drinks when we were shown from patio to our table. Another waiter gave my dinner to the table next to us and the wrong dinner to my husband. They never did get our two dinners delivered to our table at the same time, and we both ate from one plate until the 2nd dinner arrived. We were there for an agonizing 2 1/2 hours and never did get our drinks"""""""
2	"""I'm making some brussels sprouts with bacon for dinner so I was reminded to write a review of Eddie's.\n\nWe were in AZ for spring training and needed somewhere to have dinner for a party of 6. We went to Eddie's on St. Patrick's Day because they were the only restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale that had a large seafood selection on their menu and we were in the mood for fish. Turns out that the menu they have online is not the same as the one they have in the restaurant but there were still some good seafood options.\n\nIt was very busy because of the holiday so I expected slower service. Surprisingly the service was not very slow given how busy they were. Our waiter was a bit odd and tried hard to be charming but ended up just being weird. Two ladies at our table decided to split a bottle of wine. He told one he didn't need to see her ID but told the other he needed to see hers. I jokingly said \next time, just ask for both IDs so you don't offend one\"""" to which he awkwardly responded that he thought the woman was about 25. Too little too late but it started our meal off on a funny note. The waiter also seemed pretty condescending about the ladies ordering a \""""strong\"""" bottle of red wine. Apparently women can't handle bold wines?\n\nMany of the items on the menu are available in half portions, which seems nice at first. But, we were told the half portions were tiny so we should order full portions even though we had salads/soups as well. The prices for the half portions didn't even make it appealing to order two half portions so you could try more items. So, I'm not sure why they bother with the half portions.\n\nOne of the specials was arctic char over kale with gruyere. I love kale, char and gruyere so I quickly ordered that. I also ordered a side of brussels sprouts with bacon and a wedge salad. My salad was good so if you're a fan of wedge salads, order it. My entree arrived but my brussels sprouts did not. By the time I got the waiter's attention, we were nearly half way through our food. Since we were sitting in front of the kitchen I knew my brussels hadn't been made and they wouldn't have time to make them properly. But, our waiter assured me they would be out shortly. I heard the kitchen frantically trying to get the brussels out. When they arrived at the table, they looked moist and raw with some sad, dry pieces of bacon sprinkled around. Against my better judgement, I tried one. It was all but raw. I thought maybe that one just didn't get cooked and tried another. Same deal. The bacon also had no flavor and there was absolutely no seasoning on the sprouts. My friend tried some too and could barely get one down. I told the waiter they were raw and tasted terrible and he said \""""that's how we cook them here...al dente.\"""" I don't know about you, but brussels sprouts are not a vegetable I like undercooked. They are bitter and hard if you don't cook them thoroughly. They were taken off our bill without me asking so that was good.\n\nBack to the arctic char. The fish was cooked well and had nice flavor. Unfortunately the chef seems to hate vegetables so the kale was absolutely drowning in gruyere. I couldn't actually taste any kale. The kale was just a delivery device for the cheese which is a shame, because I love kale as much as I love brussels sprouts. My friend also ordered the char and kept asking why it was so salty. It wasn't actually salty, it was just that there was so much cheese that it seemed salty.\n\nMy boyfriend had the lobster bisque and the scallops. Both were good. The scallops were cooked perfectly. They make for a light dinner though so make sure to order something else with them. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals.\n\nOn our way out, we met Eddie. He is very friendly and personable and I hate leaving this poor review but I have to be honest about our experience so they can improve. I asked Eddie about the brussels sprouts and he said he does undercook them but they shouldn't have been raw. He admitted he didn't taste them before they went out and apologized. They had a crew there filming the restaurant for a show on Food Network so maybe we'll see Eddie on TV. If we go back to Scottsdale I don't know that we'll go to Eddie's again. But that doesn't mean I don't think you should try it. Just don't get the brussels sprouts or any vegetable with cheese.\n\nThey do have a bar area that looked pretty happening if you're looking for a place to grab a drink and a quick meal."""""""
5	"""We came to Arizona to watch The Dodgers at Spring Training, and we asked the local YELPers for some advice about where to have dinner and drinks.  They recommended the Roosevelt Row for art\\, food, and delicious beverages.\n\nWe didn't see much art, as we weren't here for the \First Friday,\"""" which seems to be the busiest day of the month on this strip, and we didn't really look too far for food, because we ended up at The Roosevelt, which tickled our fancies for plenty of great reasons:\n\n1. Great beer selection - We had Delerium Tremens, Stone Arogant Bastard, Roosevelt House Pale Ale, Alpine White Rascal, and Hitachi White Ale, and all of them were delicious, as well as fairly priced.\n\n2. Fantastic food menu - There were a lot of interesting options to choose from, but we went with the Pan Del Padre (Croustini with chorizi and manchego), Nocino (basically a Media Noche without the pickles), and the Wonder Dog (a very environmentally-concious frank with your choice of toppings).  Everything was tasty, and we couldn't even finish it all, because the portions were so generous.\n\n3. AMAZING service - We're from California, and we told the staff that.  There is no reason that they should be so friendly and accomidating to us, as there's no way for us to become regulars.  However, they were attentive, knowledgeable, warm, and welcoming.  Kori, Rachel, and Leah were all alternating behind the bar, and we never wanted for anything.  Our glasses were always full with great beer (see above), our questions about the city were always answered with excitment and vigour, and our taste buds were consistantly flattered by the sumptuous fare they recommended.  A+\n\n4. Comfy Ambiance - It's a converted house, like a lot of places in this area of Phoenix seem to be, but they did it right.  It's warm, comfortable, stylish, and fun.  Whomever designed this place did a bang up job.\n\nThank you, Roosevelt, you made our first night in Phoenix a great one."""""""

And Lindsey led me to AA Bondy and currently has Kings of Convenience posted as her music pick! So, for all this extra \""""Know-How\"""" I will GLADLY shell out a couple of dollars more for a CD in support of this little shop that could to keep on keeping on! As a music loving freak, I am still in favor of the tangible disc or record, so Stinkweeds is just the place for me!

It's likened to reading the paper or reading it online. You know the difference of which I speak.\n\nEveryone keeps talking about how cramped the store is... well, I think of it as more intimate... and REALLY intimate when there's an in-store performance. I still remember seeing The Trashcan Sinatras perform at the Tempe store... that was AWESOME!\n\nJust yesterday, I realized I had purchased a Ticket for a show and in my haste FORGOT the ticket! I went back this morning pretty much as soon as they opened and Kimber counted the $ and sure nuff, there was an extra ticket... which now has a home in my concert stub holder till St. V comes to wow us again in an intimate set at the Rhythm Room!

4	For me, Durant's is a drinking bar.  Not only is the menu unappetizing and contrived (to me!), but the flavors are blah.  Not bad, but blah.  I realize that their aim is to remain classic, chic, simple and distinctly American, so the things that I dislike about the menu are not exactly a deduction in my mind.  In other words, don't go there expecting artisanal, innovative food selections.  Expect steak, potatoes, and incalculable calories.\n\nThe drinks, however, are impeccably good.  The bartenders are career bartenders.  I've been going to Durant's for about 9 years, and it's usually the same two faces every time.  They are not overtly warm to everyone, and I feel that your chances of getting sassed by them are much higher if you are a younger person, but most of the time they're nice. \n\nThe bar is warm and cozy to me, I love the dim lighting, the famous decor, and the mingled scents of meat and coffee remind me of my grandmother's kitchen.  \n\nThe assortment of people is fascinating, but there's always one sloppily wasted lawyer or other downtown denizen shouting about his divorce or John McCain to bring you down.  Ignore him.
2	"""I have been to Copper Blues a couple times and I don't anticipate returning.\n\nOn the last visit, we came by with the first ever George & Dragon Toga Pub Crawl.  \n\nOur group was pretty respectful, despite most of us having had a few.  Still, we showed up with cash, credit and great attitudes.  \n\nThe waitstaff ignored many of us.  One waitress actually pushed me out of the way when I was waiting at the bar for a drink and told me \you guys need to find seats.\""""  I wasn't blocking any walkway, so I think someone just woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  \n\nThe prior visit to Copper Blues offered me similarly cold/nonexistent service, so I've got a poor taste in my mouth.  \n\nSad, because I love Stand Up Live and Copper Blues was so much more promising than Lucky Strike."""""""
5	Shalimar is a staple in the city of Tempe, and I've been playing their since I was first able to swing a club. I just turned 30, and yes Shalimar has changed hands throughout the years but they are still that same local course that I learned to play golf on. They are a 9 hole executive course with 2 par 4's, a full driving range, putting green, and chipping green. They keep the course in great condition and with the water hazards and bunkers keep it challenging. The course meanders it's way through one of Tempe's classic 60's neighborhoods and is great for new and old golfers alike. They offer great deals on lessons with a local pro who can help get you started or take your game to the next level. The guys in the pro shop are very knowledgeable and always eager to help. They even have a full restaurant and are always holding events in the evenings during the week. Whether you're new to golf or a veteran like me who just likes to have fun Shalimar is a great place to play. I'm glad they've stuck around all these decades and haven't lost their small local charm.
2	It pains me to have to write a two star review for a new restaurant.  Lord knows anyone who dares open a restaurant these days has a lot of challenges, but I can't recommend this new Vietnamese spot simply based on the food.\nThe restaurant looks great, and the staff was very friendly but unfortunately that's where the positives end.  I came in the other day and ordered a small pho tai which should be the signature dish of a Vietnamese restaurant.  I found their prices to be a bit high, but I figured what the heck-it's so much fancier than the Vietnamese places that I frequent.  I noticed the chef pouring pho bowls while I was waiting and the broth was barely brown...maybe it's pho ga I thought...regrettably, my suspicions were confirmed when I finally got my beige pho tai.\nPho broth is the holy grail IMHO, with it's deep beefy flavor combined with the sucker punch of star anise, clove and cinammon-it's probably the most soul nourishing dish that I've experienced when done well.  Pho & Grill's version was completely lackluster and even the additions of the Thai Basil, cilantro and a healthy dose of Sriracha couldn't rescue it.
2	I agree with John A.  Its incredibly Mediocre. The stores here are not really stores I usually shop in and if they are (Cole Haan, Pottery Barn, RL) I can find them elsewhere.  They get 1 star for having a nice Macys and another for having Saks.  But honestly, I kept wondering if I was in the wrong place!  The women's boutiques are not well stocked or are traditional mall stores, and the only place to eat if you're shopping alone is Coffee Plantation.  (I think...at least I couldn't find anything else....)  It does have the Cap Grille which I like but thats not enough to bring me there to shop.\n\nHonestly, I don't see how one could shop here over Scottsdale Fashion Sq.  The stores just don't compare.
5	I am faithful and loyal. Simply give me personal service and a good deal, and I am yours forever.\n\nThe fact that someone answers the phone when you call is a gift in itself. Airline travel is never going to be perfect or seamless, but I am inspired by this company who keeps a friendly attitude for the most part and a good sense of humor. \n\nI do get a good laugh out of the A/B/C lines and people camping out to make sure they get on first. I was thrilled to hear about the change in boarding and that now, people with kids have to actually suffer with the rest of us.\n\nNow if only JetBlue would make a direct flight to the Bay... there would be a strong competitor for my cheap ass!
4	Tried this place for weekday lunch.  We arrived before noon and good thing since they have a big lunch crowd.  (not to worry, plenty of parking in back and seating outside w/ misters)  Kudos to Aric and Monica for stopping by our table several times to make sure service was great or they fixed it.  We started with the Bruchetta, which was piled high.  The we had the Smokey (arugula & smoked prosciutto) and the Marg pizzas. Almost had the Pabst on tap, but went for the Dunkel since its harder to find.  As if the food wasn't enough, the decor and ambiance was over the top.  The herb garden as you walk in and the bar with the salon chairs was a nice touch. \n\nCan't wait to go back.
4	Let me just preface by saying that I don't like BBQ (not the flavor, nor the smell, etc...).  It was against my better judgement to visit this place and even consider eating here as I don't enjoy the taste at all...but, having said that - I was coerced into joining for lunch - so off I went.\n\nFirst of all, I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was.  It had everything from citrus-y grilled salmon, to burgers and of course BBQ.  I had the iced tea along with the extremely hot boneless wings (Wilbur's Revenge).  I have to admit the chicken was very spicy (I could definitely handle hotter) - but I was impressed.  I had their fries, mac 'n' cheese and corn.  The food was very fresh and tasty.  The other party had the lemon roasted chicken - wow!  Very fresh and with the Wilbur's Revenge sauce and a little tabasco to kick it up, the meal was much more enjoyable than I had ever expected it to be.  I will be back to try the bleu cheese burger, the cod sandwich, and the...sweet tea, and the list goes on!
2	"""My Aunt Sue and Uncle Frank told me about C-Fu Gourmet awhile ago, and invited me to join them for dim-sum once or twice... they rave about this place, making the drive to Chandler from North Scottsdale quite often, so I figured it would be worth it.  \n\nI saw there were mixed opinions on previous Yelp reviews for C-Fu, but sometimes you want to decide for yourself...\n\nWell, in this instance, I agree more with the Yelp average rating than I do with my Aunt and Uncle... Jared and I really wanted to like this place, but nothing about it was that great.\n\nIt has an old school Chinese feel to it, but the food was nothing to write home about... we had an order of egg rolls, wonton soup, chicken with Chinese veggies, and a noodle dish... you'd think something would stand out, but unfortunately, it didn't.  It was all pretty bland.  \n\nWe didn't even take home our leftovers... (that's when you know it's bad!)\n\nNeedless to say, we won't be returning to C-Fu, so I cannot even say \C U to C-FU,\"""" cause I won't!"""""""
5	I miss this place so much since leaving. I went there almost every day for a year, bought their coffee for my own coffee at home, and made my own toddies at home using their beans. This is the best coffe I have ever tasted. The service was always cool with me! I live in Texas now and am spoiled and can't find a good cup of coffee to save me... Best of luck Cartel, hopefully someday we will cross paths again!
3	I absolutely LOVE Tammie Coe cakes, cookies, breads etc. etc! I treat myself all too frequently to her heavenly food when eating at La Grande Orange.\n\nMy sister's bridal shower is approaching and I thought I would make the cake extra special by ordering a Tammie Coe cake.  To serve 60 people, they quoted me $500-$700!  Let's meet in the middle and say the cost ended up being $600, that's $10 a person for cake!  I was so bummed at the price quoted, and then did the math and was so shocked, I had to write a review.\n\nThe cake is beyond great and beautiful...but in my opinion, its simply a crime to charge anyone $10 per serving of cake :(\n\n5 stars for flavor, 1 star for price...because I have to commit to a star rating, giving a 3.
3	You like old school? Downtown restaurants don't get more old school than Durant's. The decor and the atmosphere haven't changed in all in the decades they've called this building home (I know this only because my parents told me so). \n\nI actually took a trip here as a matter of curiosity (and the fact my folks were treating me to a birthday dinner and it was therefore free). I didn't really have much knowledge of the place but I had been told it has the feel of a mafia hangout. They're right about that part, and you'll understand what I'm talking about if you go. Aside from that, I knew little about the menu other than it was a steakhouse. Now that I've been, a few lessons I've learned. \n\nFirst, I am the worst son in the world. I had no idea just how expensive this place was. I'd been to some relatively pricey steakhouses before, but yowzaa! $20 for a caesar salad??? $50 for fillet mignon??? $75 for a porterhouse??? My parents are saints for paying this much for a birthday meal. Second, happy hour at this place is absolutely packed. Apparently their bar area is very popular with the downtown workers during the week. And third, this place is top notch in terms of class and tradition. From the wallpaper, to the kitchen and waiting staff, to the lighting and furniture decor, this place is super elegant. You can definitely feel the ghosts of local and worldwide celebrities that passed through this place. \n\nNow for the food. Mostly good, but price is needless to say a little over the top. I understand that ambiance and service count a lot in terms of how a restaurant prices out their menu. But I'm sorry, no caesar salad is worth $20 (and yes it was good). For dinner I got the 12 oz. fillet mignon with mashed potatoes and soup ($50 in case you're wondering). I was content to not make my folks buy dessert, but they insisted so I got the fudge brownie pie ($9). The steak was tasty and well prepared and the dessert was delicious. So in terms of the food itself, I have no complaints. I'm not even going to reveal just how much my folks dropped on this meal. Let's just say I owe a lot of favors after this. \n\nSo here's a brief summary for all of you. I would recommend giving this place a whirl at least once. Preferably when you've saved up enough to really (and I mean REALLY) splurge. As frightening as the prices are, you really are buying an experience when you come here. The waiters take excellent care of the patrons, walking through the kitchen area is an experience unto itself, and you won't hear too many of their customers ever complain about the quality of the food. If you can't afford a meal, maybe stop by for drinks during happy hour as its pretty lively. Granted, I can say all of this because I got to enjoy this for free. Would I pay to go again? Sure. Just as long as I'm in a great mood.
4	I finally went to Canal on Saturday night with two girlfriends for a girls night out in Old Town. Canal was a great choice for dinner and drinks to start the evening. We sat inside in a booth and during the night some ladies in another group decided to strut their stuff on the catwalk...ahhhh, only in Scottsdale! I loved the fashion shows being shown on three screens.\n\nOur waitress was awesome on Saturday evening. She answered all of our questions, was very knowledgable about the menu and drinks, and paid the perfect amount of attention to our table. Our group of three split the scallop trio and the parmesan fries. Both were huge hits with the three of us. I thought the amount of fries we received was very generous, considering they were only $5. The scallops were cooked perfectly and it was a nice way to start our meal. I had the caesar salad as my dinner and it was the perfect size. My two friends both had the mahi-mahi tacos which they both really liked, especially since the fish was not fried. We all also really liked the cornbread that came in the bread basket because it had a bit of a kick to it.\n\nThe sauvignon blanc wine I tried was really good and reasonably priced at $8 for the glass. I also tried the Fuji Apple Martini which tasted incredibly fresh (our waitress informed us that they only use fresh fruit for their cocktails...no sugar or syrup additives thankfully) and was priced at $10. One of my friends tried the Strawberry Smash Martini which she really liked. Our bill was $128 which I thought was reasonable given the fact we had 6 alcoholic beverages, 2 small plates, a salad, and 2 entrees.\n\nCanal was a chic space and we really enjoyed our dinner there. It is definitely a place I would go for dinner or drinks with my girlfriends.
4	On our way to Sedona, AZ from Long Beach, CA we were looking for a place to eat,  more particularly a good pizza place. Under these circumstances, one can drive around till you find what seems to be a remotely good pizza place, or log on on yelp! I prefer the ladder.\n\nGreat place, great food, but not the greatest location. But as one fellow yelper stated, your car is parked in front of your dining table, so one can keep a close eye.\n\nNow to the food. The salad was great and there soup of the day was equally delicious. Now came the pizza. There pizza is delicious.. what distinguishes them from the rest is the how there pizza is prepared... everything is fresh, the dough, the cheese, the pepporoni and there tomatoes sauce is not just the regular pizza paste, this is actually prepared with real tomatoes. Throw it in the wood oven and what do you get... An extremely delicious A+ pizza. Would definitely come back if around the Phoenix area!
4	"""Big middle finger goes out to Panda right now, Japan is my new \Express\"""" for a quick Asian food fix. You should already know better than to get sushi from these types of places, so if you insist, just get something deep fried and smothered in eel sauce. Yes, it's an abomination to real sushi, but it's pretty darn tasty.\n\nThe bowls here are cheap, and come out so fast you just KNOW it wasn't made fresh. The spicy terriyaki chicken bowl was so scrumptious that I didn't care. And for a total of around $7, I inhaled it, washed down with a bottle of Ramune soda. Delicious."""""""
5	I can't believe how awesome this company is.  I live in Phoenix, Arizona and some really nice salesperson knocked on my door. I am very eager to slam the door on salespeople, but this guy led with such a compelling introduction about how he had been working in the area with my neighbors and would I care to know what he was doing with their roofs, etc.  I thought he was pleasant and not pushy at all, so we chatted for a while and agreed to a free assessment and potentially processing insurance claim if the roof qualified for replacement due to a severe thunderstorm that had taken place about 6 months prior.\n\nAs planned, the various steps for assessing the damage and qualifying for the insurance coverage were timely, well done and very professional. Every Jasper employee we met was so personable, easy to communicate with and terribly eager to assist us as necessary to ensure we were receiving the highest level of roofing replacement possible.\n\nThe roof came with a 30 Year Warranty on the Owens Corning Shingles and a 2 year Labor Warranty from Jasper.  The really amazing thing is that Jasper totally stands behind their warranty! We have these pesky skylights that are terribly leak prone, and they always have been.  Jasper has had to come out and fix the roof and test the flashing and repair the sealant for the area around these skylights, and then when Jasper broke part of the skylight, they replaced BOTH SKYLIGHTS free of charge.  All cracks and wear and tear are gone, and we have these gorgeous new skylights along with an amazing new roof!\n\nI have worked with quite a few folks, but Brad, the area manager, had to come on the line to hear my woes about the broken skylight and he was immediately out to our site and had already pre-purchased the skylight domes himself.  What a GREAT company Jasper Contracting is. I highly recommend them to anyone who needs a new roof.
3	Love the music (jazz). Like the atmosphere (artsy urban). Liked our service (friendly and very cute waitress). Love the huge and unique beer selection, although the price points are a bit high. The tomato basil soup was barely average. The Greek salad was below average. \n\nI will add this to my downtown circuit for getting drinks. Doubtful I'll come here for dinner again. The owner really needs to make a serious investment in a chef because with this location, Carly's should be rip-roaring alongside near-by Fate every night.
4	I'm rounding up to 4 stars because they were nice enough to split our dishes, as I really enjoy eating in courses (wish-I-was-in-Italy-poser).  I'd have given a full four stars, but they forgot it was my boyfriend's birthday (noted at the time the reservation was made)...  I am not going to be one of THOSE people (except for pointing it out in yelp reviews...har).\n\nStarter:  Scheiner's sausage pizza, love they are supporting local purveyor's (ok who isn't?).  I'd come back just b/c this kicks Sauce's around the corner from here.\nPrimi:  Gnocchi w/ veal, great flavor and tender shredded meat.  Disconcerting was the equally tender gnocchi, little mushy.\nSecondi:  Sea bream with broccoli rabe and polenta.  They respect their fish.\nDessert:  didn't go there, was way too full.  And thanks again for graciously letting us split our plates and eat in courses!
2	My wife, her father and myself played here yesterday based on a great deal we found through ezlinks.\n\nI came into this hoping for the best but sadly, left feeling disappointed.  This review is hard to write because the course defiantly had great potential.\n\nCONS:\n\n1.  No sign of staff anywhere upon arrival.  I have played a lot of courses in the greater phoenix area and I can't remember the last time I was greeted by anyone.\n\n2.  No help getting from the parking lot to the cart area.  This is not normally a big deal, but the parking lot sits about 100 yards from the clubhouse.  Was kinda a drag hauling three sets of clubs up.\n\n3.  The condition of the cart paths and some of the landscaping on the course was appalling.  It would go from bad to wholly crap I should have 4 wheel drive in some areas.  In one area there had to be three different ways to go at this intersection with no signage or obvious direction.\n\n4.  Have to agree with the other commenter about the old guy.  Kinda creepy and not friendly at all.\n\n5.  Slow play and no rangers.  I know some things are a little nitpicky but this one is accurate and of real concern.  The play was slow, I mean real slow especially considering it was a weekday.  In addition we didn't come across a single ranger, nope not one.  The only person that attempted to get things moving was the bar cart girl...Serious...\n\nPROs\n\n1.  The greens on this course are challenging and well maintained.  \n\n2.  The bunkers are in great shape.  Nice soft sand.\n\n3.  Given the time of year, late May, the course was not dried up or burnt in any noticeable way.\n\nI so wish this course could be upgraded.  It has so much potential and as far as I can tell, the greens keeper is doing a great job.  What this place needs is a good ranger crew, a good manager, a better pro-shop staff and a concrete paver to fix the cart paths.\n\nIf they could get some money to them and modernize, it would be a home run.
4	The outdoor dining is area is second to none and the grounds are charming.  Has anyone every tried the Macaroni and Cheese at Lon's At the Hermosa Inn?  I could not BELIEVE such a pedestrian dish could taste so DIVINE!  There's been a new chef there for about 1 year now - so I'm not sure that the SAME truffle macaroni and cheese is still or even ON the menu.  Our last waiter said that people order it for takeout - probably for the sake of not having to stay and order a $$$$ meal.
3	"""\Change Oil\""""\n\""""Change Oil\""""\n\""""Change Oil\""""\n\""""Change Oil\""""\nHow annoying is that?  For the past couple of weeks that message has been staring at me in the face... from my dashboard in the car.  Unfortunately, it did not magically disappear either.  So, I finally gave in and brought my car to Firestone.\n\nI actually called first and the guys working there sounded like they were slammed.  They said to come by first thing in the morning.  But I couldn't wait - I just wanted to check \""""Change Oil\"""" off my To-Do list.  So, I walked in, worked with Mark and Timothy, and they told me they could have me in and out within an hour and a half.  I ended up being there for closer to two and a half hours, but guess what?  That light is no longer flashing in my face and my car seems to be running well.  At $25.80, I feel like that was time and money well spent.\n\nI would return for Oil Change or other simple procedures, but not sure about more in-depth, etc... Take that for what it's worth."""""""
4	Small thai restaurant with literally 5 tables and a little bar area where 3-4 people can sit max. I really enjoyed this place even though there was a line to get seated during a busy lunch house rush. Even if you had to wait, it is usually not that long b/c the service is quite prompt even with just one server (she works hard). \n\nAs for food, I've tried the pannag curry and the spring rolls. Personally, the spring rolls were not the best I have had. I do like the peanut sauce though. The curry was def my favorite here as it had the right spices and flavors..
4	"""I've been hearing good things about Urban Yoga for almost a year now from a few of my friends, so I finally made it over there to try it out!  As a teacher, I enjoy a fabulous two week break at Christmas, which coincides very nicely with their awesome two week, $25, unlimited yoga introductory package. Done, I signed up to give it a try!\n\nTo start, I like that they offer classes at several different hours of the day to accommodate various work schedules (as early as 6:30 in the morning and as late as 7:30 in the evening).  I also really like that their class schedule online is updated regularly and is accurate, though I wish it wasn't a flash site so I could check times on my iphone.  \n\nThe studio is very modern and spacious, and I really like that they provide an array of items for students to use to assist them in their practice (blocks, blankets, bolsters, and sand bags).  As someone who used to take yoga at the gym, this is a nice perk.  I also appreciate that their classes are all offered for different levels, as opposed to \generic\"""" classes that are more \""""one size fits all.\""""  I think this really allows everyone to grow.  It also is giving me something to work towards.  So far, I have been very happy with the instructors I have come across, and really appreciate their hands-on approach, offering a block where appropriate, modifying a pose for maximum benefit, or helping to deepen a stretch.\n\nOverall, a wonderful yoga studio experience, and especially with their great new student special, I would recommend anyone give them a try!"""""""
3	"""\You like guys don't you?\""""\n\nI can't tell you how many times I heard this.  Yes, I like guys.  Sorry.  \n\nI learned that the number one pickup line in the ladies bathroom is, \""""I just got a new bra, do you think it makes my boobs look big?\""""  Or something similar.  I always assured the ladies that their bosoms were fine, but they sensed that I was a straighty and become highly disappointed.  I swear, I didn't mean for you to waste your bra pickup line on me.  Again, I'm sorry.   \n\nAnyway, this bar is rather lively on Friday nights and everyone is friendly.  The back patio was less crowded than inside and I spent most of my night there because it was easier to have a conversation.  I also spent a little time on the dance floor which was fairly deserted until about 11:30pm.  I enjoyed myself for the most part, but for some reason feel like it's just a 3.  Probably because I ended up babysitting someone I barely knew who insisted on telling everyone there that I was her best friend.  Please, if you saw me doing damage control... that girl was not my best friend, I'm just too damn nice sometimes.  Some people really shouldn't drink."""""""
2	"""The pizza here is pretty damn good for Phoenix.\n\nSame thing with the beer selections and the appetizers. We've been here a few times now, and the food has always been out of this world.\n\nWhere I am dinging them one star is the service. \n\nI get that serving is a crappy job, and that you have to deal with members of the public on a daily basis who do not understand the most basic forms of etiquette or social manners that would qualify them as members of the human species. \n\nBut there are simple things you can do as a server to keep things on the up and up with the people eating, and presumably tipping you, at your job. Like when you serve a beer in a bottle, if it starts to overflow before you get it to the table, go get another one. Its not your money, so don't worry about it.\n\nThe second star I am taking down has to do with last Friday, August 10th. I understand that from time to time people want to throw larger parties there, but you need to explain to these social megalomaniacs that there are other people eating in the restaurant, and that this is not the local \Pizza Shack,\"""" and that running around taking tons of flash photos, bumping into other tables, yelling and screaming, and acting like ass-hats in general is not acceptable behavior. \n\nIt puts me off the idea of ever going back to Classic Italian due to their inability to deal with the crowd of what I presume are birthday revelers. So much so that in thinking about it I deducted another star. I get that they were a big party, but the rest of the tables in the joint added up to more money coming in than this one party would have. Always mind where your bread is buttered Classic Italian. I've been in when its dead, and due to your inability to hand out some crowd control, you can be pretty sure that I won't be there again."""""""
2	Firstly, this is Arizona turn the air conditiioning on! Normally I am not big on atmosphere, but when its 80 degrees plus outside, I expect a comfortable temperature. I had to sit outside since the inside was stuffy, and the black curtains did not do my comfort level any justice. \n\nNow that I am done ranting a bit, lets get on to the food. At this point, unfortunately, it does not get any better. We ordered the Pasteles, a tamale with pork, plantains, raisins, and spices, for an appetizer, and it was not that great. The masa was a bit dry, and the flavors weren't as scintillating as I expected, especially for the price. \n\nFor our entrees we had the Ropa Veija (shredded beef in spices with black beans and rice), which once again was not anything spectacular. This was the highlight of the meal, which to me is sad. The beef was a bit tough and the moros (rice and black beans mixed) was dry. Sadly, our other entree was much worse. This title is held by the Pollo Cubano (marinated chicken breast with onions). The chicken was tender on the bright side, but it was covered with onions that were disgustingly soaked in lime. The flavor was overwhelming and I could taste nothing other than lime. \n\nConsidering the price, atmosphere, and quality of Havana Cafe's food I will never return. If you must try this restaurant, I ask you to please not order the items mentioned above.
2	Visited this location for the first time tonight.  I had the California Chicken sandwich and substituted the broccoli for the fries\n\nThe chicken sandwich was excellent,  very tasty.   However the broccoli was very bland like it was washed under hot water and served.   It definitely could have used a step up or two in flavor.   \n\nFor dessert I got a piece of  cheesecake to go with strawberries.   It was a good portion,  but just average in flavor.   However, they did't pack any plastic wear or napkins with it which I would assume there would be with a to go order.
5	I am giving Flamingo Palace 5 stars because they have the best food and service of any Chinese restaurant I've tried in Phoenix.  I like Bamboo House and Superdragon, too, but this is by far my favorite.\n\nMy in-laws are Chinese food experts.  I never thought we could get them to like Chinese food in Phoenix as they are from New York, where good Chinese food lives.  But they love Flamingo Palace.  Every time they visit us, they ask to go there.\n\nI just had my book club there and they were so awesome!  We had heaps of food and each was better than the next.  Plus, the service was just amazing- this with 13 people in our group.  I had such a pleasant, stress-free experience.  They gladly substituted chicken for pork, and as other people have noted, their chicken is the good stuff.  Also, they are very generous with shrimp, meat, etc.\n\nPeople in my group actually ordered alcoholic drinks from their ample drink menu, which I've never really noticed before.  I'm not much of a drinker.  But everyone really enjoyed the plum wine.  It was pretty cool that they have some different things to offer than a lot of other Chinese restaurants.\n\nFor example, try the house Flamingo chicken.  It is so good.  We wiped out their szechuan chicken, it was spicy and fantastic.  I also highly recommend their pu pu platter and spicy shrimp.  Yum!
4	My second time at Green (the first time at their Scottsdale location).  I tried the Diablo bowl with crispy tofu and noodles.  Great flavor and LOTS of tasty veggies (eggplant, broccoli, peppers, onions, carrots, zucchini) but lacking in noodles.  Still left full and satisfied though.  \n\nWas disappointed that they only have bottled teas/juices and no soda (Scottsdale location has a soda fountain).  I'm not even that big on soda, but I have one Diet Coke with my lunch each day so if it's not available - or heaven forbid, Pepsi products only - then I get disappointed.\n\nOverall, a tasty meal, and I look forward to trying other items on their menu.
4	"""Visited for dinner is weekend based on Yelp ratings.  Not disappointed.  VERY good meal and helpful staff.  \n\nPros\n- lamb was outstanding.  Had the slavocki (sp?). \n- was greeted the moment I walked in. That was nice. \n- server behind the register helped me navigate though the menu (explained I hadn't been here before).  Good customer skills.\n- I'd say the value was good.  Dish and side for under $10\n\nCons\n- the place is a little dingy.  It seemed clean, but it has a \dive bar\"""" feel to it.  This won't stop me from coming back but did cost a 'star' as the food greatly surpassed my expectations.  \n\n\nVery glad I went to check this place out."""""""
4	Yes the servers are beautiful.  The food is decent.  Good happy hour specials.  A large Blue Moon for $6.50.  The sliders were good.  They didn't come as I ordered.  The waitress never noticed she didn't bring a side order.  The food overall was ok to good.  The sweet potato fries were the only bad item.  I know, hard to mess up sweet potato fries, but they did.  Overall if you want a fun atmosphere and don't have high expectations, you will enjoy the Tilted Kilt.
2	My review for this restaurant will be simple and to the point.\n\nAs my friend and I entered the establishment, I checked my phone and found it to be exactly 6:15. Why did I check my phone? The intent was purely innocent, I assure you. I suppose it just happened to coincide with my entrance into the restaurant. We chatted between ourselves, both of us being fairly patient individuals, and both of us restaurant workers ourselves, making us doubly more thick skinned to bad experiences. \n\nMinutes pass; we are not greeted or acknowledged by a soul. More minutes pass, we begin to change our posture, to accommodate the awkward transition from entryway to dining table. Finally, an attractive young woman comes up to us with a friendly smile and leads us to our table, located next to the bar. We exchange relieved looks, after both mentally contemplating an exit stage left only moments before. The time is 6:22.\n\nAs we take a seat, the restaurant appears to be around 1/4 capacity. The temperature, lighting and music levels are appropriate. We begin to read our menus, becoming much more anticipatory of a good meal after reading some of the descriptions. More time passes, we remain ungreeted by our future server. Finally, the girl who sat us approaches, smile exhausted, and takes our order. Chips and salsa was decent, refills were far and in between. Fast forwarding, our soups arrive. They are out of this world. The Consome de Pollo and Sopa de Tortilla. Much more time passes, our entrees arrive. Both entrees were bland and uninspired, leaving both my friend and I with an empty void in both our stomachs and our wallets. Price was intermediate but overpriced for our experience. Time of exit: 7:45. \n\nI would not recommend La Parrilla Suiza based on our experience. I have talked with many others with the same experiences (slow service and great soups), so I am relieved to find that my often obligatory second visit may be skipped in this particular scenario.\n\nThanks for reading!
4	I was brought here by my coworkers. It's become sort of a ritual at my office to bring any new employees or out-of-town visitors here for lunch. Kind of a test of character. We usually go at least once a month.\n\nMy typical order is jerk chicken fried rice and egg foo yung with another varying meat option. I've tried the black beans and have to admit they're pretty good but I'm just not a big fan of lentils. I prefer having more rice.\n\nI love the egg foo yung. I dislike a lot of Americanized Chinese food dishes, but egg foo yung is one exception. My parents had a Chinese restaurant when I was younger and the egg foo yung at Chino's tastes just like my dad used to make, right down to the gravy on top.\n\nI finally tried the Chinese BBQ pork a couple weeks ago and it was surprisingly good. Not authentic, but it had a nice flavor. I also like the emerald chicken, jerk chicken, and carnitas. My coworkers swear by the Jade Red Chicken inside a quesadilla. A strange combination, but it's actually really good. I've heard that machaca inside a quesadilla is also good.\n\nFinally, who doesn't love a free snickerdoodle cookie?
5	Desert Pool Cleaning has recently become our pool maintenance company after looking for a replacement for our ex-pool guy. Ben (the owner) was quick, professional and honest. He gave us real estimates on price, timing and suggested services. Our pool needed some serious love and Ben actually drained and refilled it for us- and now it looks gorgeous. I feel comfortable knowing he is coming in and our of our backyard and I know he'll keep our pool in great shape this summer. I definitely recommended his services for anyone living in Phoenix and looking for great pool cleaning service.
4	Being new to Phoenix, I'm glad to find a nice little spot like the Roosevelt. Decent decor, decent menu, and surprising chill for a Saturday night. Employees were cool, patrons were fun in that slightly random way, and it was a good time for all. We even headed back after Bar Smith was a little disappointing...\n\nAdmittedly, I just got to Phoenix after being in... let's see... Barcelona, London, Budapest, LA, and Mexico City over the last year... On the other hand, I'm stuck out in Glendale/Peoria where I think TGI Friday's may pass for cool (sorry Glendalians but we know it's true). So the whole Phoenix scene was really starting to disappoint...\n\nNontheless, I'll be doing a lot more exploring downtown.. :-)
3	I can't imaging that I haven't reviewed Fate before. The prices are pretty good, the food is also a favorite of mine. I agree with DK, it tries to hard to be cool, but with little else to eat on roosevelt, I guess it has to. They can't seem to keep good staff, the host(s) have the amount of brain cells you expect them to have when you see of the- yes, I'm trying to be artsy- outfits they go out in public in. Just get the food to-go and you'll be alright.
4	Once again, the Hyatt Place hits a home run. This is the second time I've stayed at a Hyatt Place and my experience was just as good as the first time. The layout was practically the same. Whenever I walked in, I was promptly greeted.\n\nThe room was clean and fresh and big! You can easily have a small family in one room and not feel two crowded. You have the extra large couch to relax. T\n\nThis might be a strange thing to place, but the shower head was awesome.\n\nThere is a pool at this location as well as the breakfast in the morning.\n\nThis place is very close to Old Town Scottsdale and within a few minutes of lots of shopping, places to eat etc.\n. \nThere was a location to use the internet, which was nice. Some places charge for even just a short period of time.
4	The service is outstanding and the seafood is excellent (I've had the sea bass, scallops, salmon, ahi and filet) but if you were eating the same food anywhere else I don't think it would stand out relative to the exhorbitant prices. I've eaten here several times, all on business trips (read: expense account) and overall it's a good place to entertain clients.  I don't mind paying for a phenomenal dining experience, but I wouldn't spend my own money here.  \n\nAlso, considering the food they're serving and the prices, the wine list is suprisingly uninspired.
4	Diet advice: Never eat more chocolate than you can lift!\n\nPlaced gets packed quick! Make sure you have reservations!\n\nThe food was good. Expensive but good. Honestly it takes a lot to screw up Traditional American food. They had a deal that at $60/per person you could sample a lot of what they had to offer. Everyone at my booth took it and we got to sample almost everything! \n\nTheir white chocolate brownie was amazing. I usually don't like white chocolate. I like my chocolate like I like my.....nights? Dark? (dumb dumb dumb) but it was really good.\n\nGo for dessert. Stay to people watch- seriously, the people in AZ are different. Or maybe it's just because people think I look Mexican. You won't deport me back to Cali!
5	My husband grew up eating at this restaurant since he was young. From the staff to the food, there is nothing to complain about. We love so many different dishes here, but if we have to narrow it down to 3 it is... extra spicy orange chicken, salt and pepper calamari, and the Szechwan shrimp.\n\nThe orange chicken is whole chicken breast that is breaded instead of little nuggets. You get more chicken than a ton of breading. The orange sauce is amazing, especially with some spice.\n\nThe salt and pepper calamari.. may not seem all that exciting or exotic, but it is delicious! I love the favors the green onions and jalape\u00f1o with the salt and pepper. \n\nOur newest favorite dish is the Szechwan shrimp. It is different from what I had growing up. I don't like szechwan anything, so I would have never given this dish a second glance. Of course one day, my friend ordered it and I just about died! I know I am pretty optimistic with my reviews, but I mean it, this dish is delicious and weirdly refreshing. It has undertones of cilantro and it comes with cucumbers!
5	I had a great experience at Spinato's Saturday night. The food and service was awesome. We started out with garlic and cheese breadsticks with marinara. Orgasimic. :) There were three of us dining, and we ordered three different things to share. I have had their meatball pizza several times, and it is my absolute favorite. We also tried the baked spaghetti and meatball calzone with ricotta. Oh my! This calzone was like heaven in your mouth. It was awesome, but a tad on the rich side. A few bites of this were enough to share. We also got an Italian sausage and mushroom pizza. It was also extremely good. Our server was fantastic. She was attentive, and was very helpful in explaining items on the menu. On top of all of this, it was very affordable.
5	Giant Coffee is my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. \n\nDo I need to write more? \n\nWell, every time I've been in the baristas/os are nice, helpful and generally classy individuals. The coffee is excellent, my favorite is the honey vanilla latte, but I've yet to be disappointed. The breakfast burritos take a little long, but are worth the wait if you're in the mood for a burrito and coffee combo. The setting is laid back, and one of the few places I can go read a book or catch up with a friend- it's surreal how well Giant works for both. The only downside is they close way to early (like 7 or 8).
4	What could be better than having your nails done while you watch a movie? Not much! :)\n\nJl Nails is a small neighborhood business right off of Gilbert Road. The salon is not a fancy spa like setting but is very clean and stylish. \n\nI've been going to Jl Nails for about a month now and have been so pleased with the service, price, and attention to detail! I can be a little particular about how I like my nails and was so impressed with the time they took to make sure I was happy. \n\nThey offer a wide range of products and even have colored tips if you're looking for something unique. It can get kinda busy on the weekend so it's best to schedule an appointment.
5	I sometimes eat here with my friends after hiking Dreamy Draw Hiking Trail.\n\nYeah we ruin the burned calories by stuffing our faces with pastas and pizzas at Babbo afterwards.\n\nIs it good? Definitely!\n\nAs you sit you are swarmed with servers laying down complimentary breads with olive oil, and balsamic dip.\n\nHowever, I cannot eat bread and pastas all the time, or I'll gain weight.\n\nI have to watch my svelte figure now that I'm getting older.\n\nThey do have an interesting menu and the ones that I've had were extremely flavorful. I've had the Garlic Cheese Crostini, Bruschetta Romana, Roasted Asparagus, Mandarin Spinach, Mushroom Asparagus, and Pasta Rustico. The place is also very clean,  the ambiance is fabulous, and service is always great.\n\nHighly recommended with a great lunch menu too! :-)
4	"""One word.....FUN! As my friend Patti said as we were leaving, \I haven't laughed that hard in such a long time!\"""" That could be due to too many house special margaritas (which were really YUMMY!) or because we are a fun group of gals! \n\nEither way, The Mission delivers. Service is great. The people working there are friendly (always a must for me to ever go someplace more than once). Food is good, but the portions would be too small for my husband who still eats like food like he's a teen preparing for a football season. For us girls, it's a great reminder to keep our figures svelte- and still feel pleasantly full. \n\nTRY- Table side Guacamole. Guaranteed to be the most heavenly Guacamole you've EVER tasted! They add everything from cilantro to garlic, to hot peppers (to your taste), to cheese sprinkled lightly (or more heavy handed if you request it) on top. Last time there, 4 of us ordered 2 servings of it since the 1st time 1 serving wasn't enough for 2 of us (because it was so good I practically licked the bowl clean). \n\nMaybe it was due to having a margarita first, or not being as hungry the 2nd time, but 2 servings + a drink + the chicken tacos was PLENTY of food (I even had to save 1 taco for later). Those cute little itty bitty 3 tacos don't look like a lot of food, but once you pair them with other offerings The Mission has, you will find yourself quite satisfied. \n\nIf you go to The Mission, be sure to bring good friends (or a significant other who doesn't eat like a football player). Be ready for great margaritas, great guacamole, nice servers, and a \""""chillaxed\"""" environment. \n\nEnjoy!"""""""
5	"""I could not be more thrilled with our first visit to see Dr. Sotelo at Papago Buttes.  From the initial phone call, until we left the office, I was pleased with every interaction I had we had.   \n\nIt started with a phone call to see if Dr. Sotelo, who came highly recommended, was accepting new patients.  To my excitement he was.  I wanted to make an appointment for the same week, and they were able to accommodate my request.  Before we hung up the call I was told that I would receive a call before my appointment to get all of my information entered into their system.  I loved this!  Someone from the office took all of our information over the phone so when we arrived at the office, we had no paperwork to fill out!  Three signatures (privacy policy, permission to treat, agreement to pay for services), all on the same sheet of paper, and we were free to enjoy the lobby entertainment until our name was called.  \n\nThe parking lot was large and not crowded.  The waiting area provided ample seating for adults, a bookshelf filled with children's books, a play table and a few small chairs or little ones.  One of the walls was an activity wall with interactive games for the kids while they waited.  \n\nAfter a few minutes, our name was called and we were led back to a room.  Just outside the room was a large toy box. The nursed encouraged us to grab some entertainment on our way in.  My initial thought was, \I guess that means it will be a while.\""""  Wrong!  The nurse took our measurements right away and said the doctor would be right with us.  \n\nWithin five minutes Dr. Sotelo entered the room.  He spoke to me like I was his equal and explained what he was doing as he did it.  My daughter appreciated this, as did I.  I had chosen to delay certain vaccines. Dr. Sotelo took the time to hear my reasoning behind the decision.  Instead of pushing me to move forward with them, he answered my questions and let me choose how to proceed. After the doctor left, the nurse returned and administered the injections we had decide to go forward with.  When she was done she led us to Dr. Sotelos office.  \n\nDr. Sotelo met us in his there, offered my daughter a sugar-free sucker (which she devoured in minutes), and we sat and discussed milestones, development, etc.  On the way out, a friendly staff member set up our next two (!) appointments, and we were on our way...well, almost on our way.  My daughter insisted on a few more minutes of play time in the lobby before we headed out.  Yes, that is right, she didn't want to leave.\n\nNever did I feel rushed or forgotten.  My daughter had a blast.  The staff was professional, respectful, friendly and courteous.  What more could you ask for in a pediatrician?"""""""
4	"""RigaTony's has been a standby for me for as long as I can remember. I even went there for prom night, many years ago. I've been to both of the old locations, and more recently to the new one, and I've tried a good deal of their menu.\n\nI find that the quality of their food is usually pretty damn spot-on. I've been disappointed with my food only once or twice; my normal favorites like the Chicken Picatta are absolutely fantastic and topped with a great mix of tomatoes and capers and such, and perfectly cooked and breaded. The Italian Sausage is fantastic, and the stuffed shells are great too, but the alfredo is usually a bit... tacky. The sauce is a bit thick in that it's usually lopped on top and doesn't mix well, though it's pretty tasty even after that.\n\nThere's enough special about this place to keep you coming back and enjoying yourself. Instead of the industrial strength, flavorless slabs of breaded sad-chicken I've found at other nearby Italian places, the overall quality is really enjoyable for \mid-range\"""" Italian food. \n\nThe prices are fantastic: $16 or so for a \""""Tour of RigaTony's\"""" that includes the picatta, sausage, shells, and alfredo is spot on, and easily two meals. The bread is incredible (ask for some scampi butter instead of the oil for a fun treat) and the salad and house dressing are REALLY good. \n\nThe service is hit-or-miss. I haven't been to the new location during any sort of dinner rush, just once a bit later where our server was just fine, but I've been disappointed by the service (especially at the old Brown location) so many times that I've taken to just taking out. RigaTony's travels well, and their carry-out deals include the salad, bread, and usually a dessert, including their tasty chocolate cake.\n\nNot much of an oenophile or drinker in general, so I can't comment on the wine selection at all, but overall, you can have a tasty experience here with generally high quality food all around. Little improvements could make things a lot better, and I'll have to report back the next time I visit during dinner on the service, but I've been going for years and I love the place.\n\n(Oh, one final thing: their lunch specials are INSANE. They vary from day to day, but you can be in and out in about a half hour for $7 with some GREAT food!)"""""""
4	"""Quite very good! \n\nWe came there Friday night as a small group of 8 people. Service was terrific. I would be hard pressed to find more accommodating personnel! Every one is super friendly without being too obnoxious, that is hard to find.  \nIts also BYOB, and that is a great plus! They will be happy to chill your beer and bring out a cooler for the table to your wine or sake. Super nice!\nFood was excellent too. One of the friends referred to it as \Best Ever!\"""", but i do not know about that. It's surely VERY good - fresh, good quality, well prepared. All top notch.\n\nIt was a good experience and while it was somewhat pricey, i will not hesitate to drop by if i am around there. \n\n\""""I like!\"""""""""""
5	"""Executive Chef, Beau MacMillan is a food rockstar! This talented chef has reigned supreme over Iron Chef America's, Bobby Flay in Battle American Kobe Beef. Simplicity, farm-to-table methods and a dizzying blend of Eastern flavors deliver a trance-like knockout punch. You've had spa treatments all day, you feel warm and fuzzy, then you take into your mouth a homemade edamame and roasted shallot stuffed ravioli with summer vegetable ragu & yuzu chive beurre blanc. Blow gently on me and watch me fall over with delight!\nChef MacMillan combines elements to make masterpieces. Appetizers here can be stir-fried black mussels with sea beans, grilled scallion & garlic caramel, fiery calamari served with Chinese long beans & miso scallion vinaigrette, or creamy spinach and parmesan casserole with tomato jam & herb toast. No matter what you choose, savor the taste! The main course this restaurant is known for: everything! Bacon wrapped filet alongside freshly flown-in seafood morph the menu from day to day as only the freshest ingredients are selected! \nSpecial note: elements has an urban feel. Hard to describe, the big-ctiy techno-pulse is detectable within the framework of this spa retreat. Shiny mirrored art objects and cyber-green colors set up the feel of a trendy 30-something bar. It just so happens the restaurant's \jade bar\"""" mixes fresh cocktails with nods to mixology's past: cantaloupe martinis, eastern raspberry sidecars, and their Hemingway special are oft requested as well as non-alcoholic specialties. If you are looking to make him or her say \""""YES\"""" to ANYTHING try table 41. It's jaw dropping views of the mountain will make your objet d'amour willing.\nDining here is a true experience. From the ambiance to the gastronomic tempting, to the Moulton Brown lotion in the ladies room, every detail is \""""elementally\"""" perfect."""""""
5	I'm definitely glad I visited this place. Thank you Yelp! Our waitress Tuti is the sweetest, most helpful waitress ever. This is my first experience with Turkish food and I must admit, per Tuti's recommendations on food choices, it was absolutely amazing. They definitely bring what may seem like ordinary food to an entire new level. The hummus is creamy and extremely flavorful along with warm toasted pide. We had the dana kebabs and each piece of meat was cooked to such perfection, paired so well with the rice and vegetables that you could literally taste the chef's love for food and cooking. To finish off our dinner on the wonderful note, we had one of each of the baklavas with Turkish tea. This was definitely an experience! Excellent food, excellent service, excellent price. Fantastic job. We will definitely see you soon Tuti!
4	The previous reviewers reviewed brunch and lunch- so I'll review dinner!\n\nCinco de Mayo brings craziness to Old Town Scottsdale and we popped in here to escape it.  (I think I was lured by the classic rock they were pumping out of the speakers...)  As soon as we walked in the bartender greeted us and we were seated with menus.  The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is great- beautiful glass and iron chandeliers and bright colors.  They have an amazing tequila list- no Cuervo here!- which my husband appreciated very much. \n\nWe had three tapas plates for dinner, which in some places wouldn't be enough to fill you up, but here it worked.  All three were fantastic, especially the Churassco. We also got the Shrimp Barbados and the Double Dip.  The crab fondue with the Double Dip was delicious, especially when eaten with the cucumbers.  The hummus as a little bit of a punch to it so be careful!  The prices were very reasonable for tapas and you can't beat $5 margaritas. \n\nI very much enjoyed Carumba Cafe and I definitely plan on returning.  I think the next trip may be for brunch....
4	My girlfriend and I had dinner here with my brother and his wife this past Saturday. It was packed outside so we had to sit outside which was fine. If anything it got a little too warm under the heat lamps, but the atmosphere was fine.\n\nFood was very tasty across the board. We had steak and organic chicken on our side of the table both of which were cooked exactly how we wanted them. Juicy and tender. \n\nService was excellent. Recommended.
4	Took the light rail from downtown to Postino's on a Saturday--felt downright cosmopolitan!  Got there just before 4PM, earning me a few bucks off my first glass of wine.  The patio was just about full, and within an hour there was a waiting list for both inside and outside dining, so try to hit this place during off-hours.\n\nService was friendly, and the bruschetta was great--for those who haven't done the Postino's thing before, you pick four flavors out of twelve and get a bite of each for each member of your party.  The peppers and goat cheese, the fig and apple, and the prosciutto were outstanding.  Paninis and grilled cheeses floating by looked delish.  Wine was reasonably priced, and a lot more so from 11-4.\n\nYou can watch the poor valets scurry about in the sun while you lounge on the patio, reminding you that you're glad you walked or light railed in.  The place is open-air, even inside, and I'm interested to see how it works in the heat of summer.  We had a perfect springtime afternoon in the sun on their patio--just make sure one of your foursome brings sunglasses. :)
5	Little Saigon, such a quaint little place in [usually] desolate old town Glendale. \n\nWeekends are reasonably busy here, but we came on a Thursday...and were basically the only ones there. Is 8pm really that late??? Come on, night owls, where are you?\n\nOrdered the delicious spring rolls (as described in the review below mine). The sweet fish sauce is such a great complement for these things. Also had the egg crepe, filled with bean sprouts and shrimp. Bean sprouts were fresh, crisp...but the shrimp were a little overcooked. Piling the crepe onto a bed of lettuce, mint leaves, and lemongrass was so refreshing. You can eat so much of this stuff, and not feel guilty. Those were just appetizers. \n\nNow onto the main course. I'm always indecisive about which soup I want, but I settled with the #12, which consisted of rice noodles in beef broth, beef and pork slices, tendon, tripe, and meatballs (consistency was similar to that of the meat in a gyro). With some generous dashes of sriracha, chili paste, and fish sauce, I was in another world. In addition, this lovely medley was served in a king size bowl. Thumbs up to that, and to myself... for finishing the whole thing. \n\nEveryone I dined with was quite satisfied with their dishes, and I would have liked to share a description of each dish, except I was too consumed with my own bowl that I became oblivious of my surroundings about 20 minutes into the meal. \n\nTowards the end, the endearing chef made an appearance and surprised us with dessert- on the house. Nice!  \nI enjoy coming here... very homey, and lighthearted people. I'll probably visit again this week!
5	On a super crowded Sunday during football season, Four Peaks still delivers. Great service, cold local beer, and a good selection of better than average bar food. I had the breakfast burger with a large patty, topped with bacon, an egg, cheese, and jalape\u00f1o mayo. The bun was flavorful, and the burger itself was perfect. The potatoes were well seasoned too. Hubby had a white pizza with chicken and mushrooms. Great portions. We rode our bike here as do lots of other fans. This place favors the Vikings on SuNday mornings, so beware! Breakfast till 2pm, and good eats all day long. Thanks for the friendly service too.
4	I Love Heidi Boutique!! They have the cutest stuff and are always getting new product in. The prices are a little high, I can usually get the same designers/brands for a little cheaper at Juicy Couture, Nordstrom or other stores, But they are not too bad.\n\n The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because they are either very friendly and helpful when I come in, or they are rude and do not even acknowledge me when I go in there. Customer Service is a huge thing with me, so normally I would give them a lot lower score for this, but since I Love their stuff so much I will give them a 4!! I would recommend more sales and specials!!

5	"""What a cool little place tucked away behind a strip mall.  Would never have found this if it was not suggested by a good friend who raved about the cappuccino!  He is world traveler, so, it's a  must try if it's the best cup he's ever had.  He was right!  Don't know if it's in the beans or the care that they take to make it with a fab froth decoration on top.  My hubby and I loved the caramel brulee taste..  My son loved the hot \warm\"""" cocoa.  Yeah, we walked in as a family last night and almost everyone turned our way since we did not fit the hip college crowd.  Everyone was really friendly, though. The sweet young man behind the counter gave my son some micro cinnamon doughnuts and scored major points with the little dude!   We will be back."""""""
4	To be honest, this is my first time playing 18 holes golf game ever. I am a very beginner. This place is beautiful, especially under the cloudy day in early December in Arizona (See photo). \n\nMy friend book the early tee time online for Wed for only $18 per person including golf cart. We had good time playing golf there. The staff at the front door giving us the golf cart key is very nice.\n\nI have never played at other golf course at suck price, so I am unable to compare. I will be playing tomorrow again. Hope I get even better experience this time.
4	I went to the North Scottsdale location with some family, and everybody got their grub on. Some of the best BBQ I've had in a long while. Not sure if it's better than Texas Smokehouse in SJ, but pretty darn close. I had the El Paso rib combo which was 1/2 a slab of Baby Backs & 1/2 a slab of St. Louis style, both were very, very good. My wife had the triple combo (chicken, pulled pork, & beef brisket). I sampled ;) the pulled pork & brisket. The PP was excellent, esp. slathered in their spicy BBQ sauce. The brisket was OK, it was cut a little too thin for my taste. My mom had a burger, and she loved it. Which is actually a big compliment, because she hates eating out. All the sides I tried were eXcellent: cowboy beans, steak fries, sweet potato fries, & coleslaw. The price was pretty typical for BBQ places, 5 people ate for under $90, and that included an appetizer (spinach dip, yum!) and a couple of blended drinks. All in all a great experience. I def. want to go back before I leave town..
5	Let me start by saying that the guy named Craig Z. must be a Cub fan because everything he said about the park is a total lie. You are not forced to park on any premise for any ball park anywhere in the world. If that was the case then just don't go butthead. Secondly if you get there early enough just like with any other stadium then you can park close and the walk is about 100 yds to the gate...if that. Scalping or Selling of tickets is not even allowed at the stadium...the only place you will find people selling tickets is 2 miles up the road near the expressway...and trust me no one is buying them.\n\nIf your going to give a negative review Craig Z, then you should at least tell the truth you moron. Look this is the cream of the Crop of Arizona Cactus League Stadiums. The sight lines for the games are excellent...the Berm area is immaculate, and even the food is not badly priced considering it is a spring training ballpark. The players are very good about giving autographs (i got 4 myself when i went last night) and for those who have been to U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago they even use the same great introduction here. So if you want a great spring training experience for friends and family...your final destination should be at this stadium. Eat, Drink, and be Merry here at Camelback Ranch my friends!!!!!
5	Yes this place is small but that what's makes it ooze character. The Rusty Spur is a true country bar smack in the middle of Scottsdale. They have live music every afternoon and night seven days a week. It's locally owned, has been around forever. You're always greeted with a a warm welcome from the servers, band and patrons. The atmosphere is great and dollar bills cover the walls and ceiling. Little known fact... every year they have a party where they take down all the dollars, Rusty Spur then matches the amount and it all gets donated to a local Charity. Yee haw!
4	Love to come here early in the morning on the weekend (before 8am). We bring our 17 month in and the loud music covers his early morning noises. The food is fresh and bright and delicioso, the atmosphere is pretty good, the clientele are upscale and eclectic. This is a good spot, except that we are starting to get  bit bored by the food. It's great, but we could use a little menu change once in a while. The aforementioned music is usually too loud -and I'm a guy who inhaled and listened to Van Halen I at at full volume for about three years-- but we still love it and the fact that we can get in there without crowds is really a plus.
3	"""I used to live around the corner from this joint on Earll, and used to hit it up every once in a while. Can't say anything bad about this place, and strangely enough, I haven't much good to say either! Its JUST A BAR! Don't give me that \its cool because regulars occupy the place.\"""" To me, if you are a \""""regular\"""" in  bar, you need to expand your horizons. I will say this, its in Scottsdale and its not pretentious! There."""""""
4	This place is pretty decent. The food is OK. certainly not fantastic, but not awful. The real reason that I come to the Yard House is for the beer. I 1/2 yard of beer to be more specific. \n\nThe Glendale location is in the Westage city center, which to me has that Vegas combined with Vegas feel. Every time I come here I feel like I am in side a giant building with a painted, realistic sky. All of the bright lights and signs help my brain think I am in Vegas too. Well, sadly, it is not Vegas. However, still a fun place.\n\nHere is the beers that I have had.\nAnchor Steam\nMad River Jamaican Red\nBelhaven Scottish Ale\nPaulaner Lager and Pilsner\n\nin addition they had tons of domestics and imports ( bud, Coors, Stella, Pabst etc.) \n\nThe servers are always super friendly and are helpful in choosing which beer you want. Just ask for a good pilsner or red. They will help you out. Yard house also has a beer sampler where you get a collection ( i think 6) mini beers to try. \n\nOne word of caution: If you break a 1/2 yard glass, you most likely will get charged for it! I think the charge is $10. So, don't get sloppy and start throwing them.
2	"""My first time going.....\n\nThe waitress looked like she was ready to give birth as she took our drink order. I had stated I had never been there before but she still didn't give me the break down of how this whole grill thing worked. \In her defense she appeared to be the only one working there\"""" \n\nMy kids loved it because their bowl's were endless, they were able to make and eat as much as they wanted and it was well priced for theirs. \n\nThe adult bowls on the other hand were not worth it. Very pricey for one bowl and wouldn't be worth it to spend almost $15 for an endless bowl. \n\nThe grill line wasn't as clean as I would have wanted, but needless to say the kids that were in front of us knew how to pile on their items and just leave a mess behind. \n\nThe part of watching them grill, I have to say I was impressed and my daughter were in aww to watch it happen also. \n\nWe had a 20% off coupon and the waitress never took it off the bill, had to wait 15 minutes just to get our bill so I didn't want to wait any longer to have her deduct a few dollars. \n\nThe food tasted excellent. If they would lower their price and get some better staff I might frequent this one more often."""""""
3	"""The best thing about this place are the bathrooms! No Shit! Er, I mean no kidding!\n\nThe decor in the bathroom is expensive, mimicking a Japanese ancient Castle, with large cuts on stone masonry, copper pots for sinks, and metal tubes to look like large bamboo as the faucets. \n\nThe next best thing is the large stone in the middle of the room. It is a large rock with a spotlight on it, and mimicks a Japanese rock garden.\n\nThe third best thing is the out door patio seating, with the misters going full blast as the tempurature still hovers around 100 at 11:00pm in August. There are several tables out there, and also some couches.\n\nThe 4th best thing is the Pachinko machines in the entryway, brightly lit and real, However, as the cute hostess will tell you, she has no balls (for the pachinko machines, stupid!)\n\nThe 5th best thing is their large drink menu of specialty drinks. I didn't look in there for an \Orgasm\"""" or a \""""SloeComfortableScrew Against the Wall\"""", or other ridiculous concoctions, etc. \n\nI felt like a Tanqueray and Tonic.  No, Make it two!\n\nThe rest of what they have to offer is, well, meh!"""""""
3	This place has been getting so much play lately I'm starting to get a little jealous.  With the professional volleyball tour now located there and Jordin Sparks shows there every other day - it's really turning into a hub for the Westside. \n\nI went over there to meet a friend (from Surprise) to hangout as this was decided to be a good meeting point.  Westgate sports that whole faux-town square thing that is all the rage in American suburbia.  You'll find a grassy town square (with baby trees offering little to no shade) that kids and families actually hang out in.  You'll find actual middle class shops in contrast to Kierland Commons.   This place isn't exactly my cup of tea, but people at the center seemed to be enjoying it as it was quite busy.\n\nIt's a loud bold monstrosity in what seems (at least now) to be the middle of nowhere - like an oasis in the middle of one GIANT parking lot.   The huge AMC movieplex and Renaissance Marriott hotel are the centerpieces here and chain restaurants abound here like Yard House, Gordon Biersch and soon to be built Gardunos.  \n\nIt's like a smaller version of Kierland with retail on the first floor and office on the upper floors, but more isolated, with not as many stores and with huge Times Square-like billboard ads EVERYWHERE.  It looks really TACKY.  I think if you even stand around long enough you'll find a billboard on your back.
5	Best vacation I've ever had.  They practically give these rooms away in the summer, and it's a great value.  The service is amazing, the rooms are understated but elegant, and my favorite is the prickly pear iced tea that they have free flowing all over the resort.  Such a relaxing visit- after three days I felt better than I had in years.  Something about the overwhelming desert heat... FORCES you to just relax.  Nice quiet pool, free of horrid disco music.  Great value!!!
1	I received flowers today from my best friend for my birthday. She ordered them through FTD and they were delivered by Flowers 2005. I sent a photo of the arrangement with a thank you text to my friend and she called me immediately letting me know that was not what she order. The arrangment consisted of 6 gerber daisys, it looked like a $5 bunch of flowers from Trader Joes with extra greenery. An embarrassing situation for us both, glad we are such great friends. Unfortunately, being new to town and knowing that this is what I can expect from Flowers 2005 I will never order flowers from them.
2	Upon arriving @ Buster's On the Lake, it became immediately clear that our party was underdressed.  Most guests came attired in khakis and button downs at the very least; our part was full of out of town shorts and basketball shirts.  \n\nThat said, our reservation was honored, no problem, and we were met w/ a minimal amount of disapproving glances.  \n\nSure, they seated us in The Lounge, a darkened bar which it became apparent was the restaurant's haven for the undesirables:\n  \n    There goes that 30-year-old, hunched over in her walker. Oh, look, \n    Honey!  An interracial couple wearing somewhat urban attire.  Is it \n    Halloween?  That couple's teenage daughter didn't dress beyond her\n    years and OMG TOO MUCH PLASTIC SURGERY OVER THERE!!!\n\nWe were there for Thanksgiving and the $28 dollar price tag suggested a fine dining experience.  What one got was a slightly above average cafeteria/bar setting (I kept the half-lukewarm Thanksgiving turkey because it's just so obnoxious to send things back) and a friendly glance from the waitstaff forced to work while half the world was off enjoying time w/ their families.\n\nIt could just be that wheelchairs don't fit so nicely into anywhere but The Lounge, but Buster's is still nothing you'd want to drive 45 minutes out of your way for.
5	Why has no one else thought of this before?  This place is awesome!  Yes, it's a bit greasy...and your stomach is usually a little more than confused at what you've just put into it...but your mouth is damn happy!  We tend to go for spicy - so my husband would always get something super hot (pollo diablo, for one) in a quesadilla or burrito (sometimes both).  I've tried some of the sweeter ones (emerald chicken), but I think they really spicy entrees work best.  So so yummy!  They also make a pretty good snickerdoodle to finish off your meal with!
5	Bueno!\n\nWe had a very enjoyable experience at this restaurant. We didn't have a reservation but they had a high table available immediately for us which worked fine for us.\n\nBread and water were brought to the table promptly and a quick explanation of what specials were available that evening. Friendly welcoming staff is always a plus to me.\n\nWe had the kobe beef meatballs which tasted great but basically a meatball to me!\n\nThe manila clam linguine was very light tasting and you do get loads of clams. All in all, it was very easy to eat. If that's what you are after then you can't go wrong with this dish.\n\nI had the veal which was also excellent. Complemented excellently with vegetables and mash. Yummy.\n\nThanks!
4	Great place to sit outside & enjoy an afternoon with a friend, especially since the AZ weather is startin to cool slightly!  There were mostly business types and tourists dining around us.  We chatted over drinks while taking in the water fountains @ the AZ Center and soaking up comfortably warm sun rays.\n\nWhile waiting for our food, we grazed on chips that resembled a mix of real tortilla chips and some potato puffs that reminded me of Munchos.  Except the things that looked & crunched like Munchos had a slightly sweet taste.  I ordered the blackened fish tacos.  My plate came with the double shelled tacos with a zesty sauce and a choice of toppings for you to spoon yourself--black beans, spicy coleslaw mix & Spanish rice.  AT the end of the meal, they brought out white chocolate that had been chilled & wrapped in a corn husk.  It was just enough to satisfy a dessert craving without making you feel like crap, if you'd decided to order dessert after a deliciously filling meal.\n\nThe only drawback is that the prices are a lil high--$10.95 for my Orange Beso margarita, which was poured @ the table.  (The server left the remainder in the shaker for me to imbibe).  And my taco plate was around $10 too.
5	"""So I signed up with this gym about 4 months ago, my sales person's name was Kyle.  Wow he was great!  Right from the moment I had to fill out the forms he was polite and professioanl.  He answered all my questions and didn't try to \sell\"""" me on the gym.  Let's be honest, there are lots of gyms to choose from, LA Fit, Lifetime, etc etc and they all offer pretty similar perks.  Gold's certainly stands out and Kyle and his manager, I think his name is Blaine, pointed out what stands them apart from the competition.  A movie theatre I do my cardio in, amazing instructors in the classes, especially spin, towel service, a free body fat assesment from the trainers.  I was just really surprised at all the extra.  \nNeedless to say I go about 5 times a week and I have yet to have any issues after 4 months.  I think they ran out of towels once and Kyle said as soon as fresh ones came out of the dryer he would find me upstairs and bring me a towel.  The staff is friendly, the gym is clean, the price is fair.\n\nGood job Gold's!"""""""
4	"""Went here for brunch and had the olive oil waffle.  It was pretty good, although my husband didn't like the \cafeteria\"""" style seating and serving.  You go up and grab your tray when your buzzer goes off.  There seems to be a good deal of seating inside and out, and from what I've heard they have live bands play in the fall!  Something I'll definitely be checking out!\n\nThey have a lot of different olive oils, some good, some not-so good...but you can try them all at your leisure.  They also have a good selection of free recipe cards you can grab which I really liked.  The shop has a small selection of wine, and lots of different olives, tapenades, and other spanish/italian fare.  Fun for a dinner party, but a little over-priced.\n\nOverall a unique, fun place in the middle of nowhere!  I'd go again, especially for lunch as I've heard from many people that their sandwich selection is great!"""""""
2	"""I was hungry for a slice and my favorite place in old town was closed.  So, we'd been meaning to try Nello's anyway so we went in.  \n\nWe ordered the 14\ Numero Uno, which is homemade sausage with mushrooms, pan crust.  It looked great and it smelled great, and it had a great cheese coating, so imagine my surprise when I bite into it and find that its very bland.  The crust was good.  I can taste the cheese..  I tried putting a ton of red pepper flakes on top and then parmegan cheese, but it didn't help much at all.  \n\nVery interesting.  I kept eating it trying to figure out the problem.  I've had mushroom on pizza before by itself and it didn't taste like this.  The crust is ok, not undercooked although it kind of tastes similar to undercooked dough.  I think it might possibly be not enough sauce.  I'm still not sure...  But I will stick to Best of Italy, thank you very much."""""""
4	"""these guys have really stepped up their game a notch\nback in the day it was subpar really\nbut i ordered a spinach and sausage pizza a few weeks back and it was great, not too much cheese, and good thin crispy crust\nnot many places around the area are open late\ncome 1am you have a choice between various disgusting fast \food\"""" chains, ex$pen$ive $ilver mine $ubs, or these guys, which when you line em up, isnt much of a choice at all\ngood job fella's, now just dont mess it up!"""""""
1	"""Oh my god, please don't make me eat here ever again. \n\nWhen I first moved into the neighborhood I made it a choice to check out the local restaurants. Overall, I was very pleased with the half a dozen restaurants that occupy 7th Ave between Indian School and Camelback. Then, I tried Diamond's. \n\nWhere to begin? Okay, so you walk in and the first thing you may notice is: filth. Now, I'm no fancy pants, and I love some dive joints, but this is just too far. Dirt and stains on \cleaned\"""" tables, multiple open fish tanks that stink up the whole place, trash on the floor, questionable odors galore, dirty silverware. Oh.My.God. \n\nI try to be brave. I order some food - sweet & sour something or another. The sauce? It's goo. Like thick, gooey goo. I am so grossed out by whatever I am eating and the filth surrounding me that I find myself unable to eat. Again, I have eaten in my share of one-star restaurants, but none have been this bad. \n\nIt's odd, because I've heard so many good things about this place. I honestly don't know what is going on because there is no way this could be the same place people are raving about. I know the prices are good, but hey - eating out of a dumpster is free, so why not just go there? I don't know, maybe I'm a snob. Maybe I went there on an \""""off\"""" day. Maybe it deserves a second shot to be sure, but honestly, there is no way I could ever set foot in this place again. \n\nI ended up paying the check and running across the street to America's Taco Shop for a few margaritas to try to wash away the memories."""""""
1	"""Ok, first of all, when I got there this morning to pick up my lunch,  the guy behind the counter was hitting on the gal in front of me so hard.  He spent all of his time and smiles on her that by the time he got to my order, he had not an ounce of friendliness left.  He acted like he was doing me a favor, begrudgingly.  That in itself is nothing, I have lowered my expectations of customer service since this new generation of pimple popping orgy addicts got their work permits a few years ago.  However, when I got the foot-long turkey sammi back to my office, the half I chose for breakfast had a little good morning suprise. (I just threw up in my mouth a bit.)\nThey should change their slogan from \Eat Freash!\"""" to \""""Eat Some Complete Stranger's Hair, Then Gag and Lose Your Appetite Completely\"""".  I'll bet that is the real reason Jared lost all that weight.  \nNot happy Subway.  There is  a lovely Quiznos on Central and Camelback...

4	Went there for the first time on Saturday!\n\nWas with my bf and two friends. Mt bf was casually dressed and the other three of us were decked out in our goth club wear.\n\nIt was lot's of fun but pretty dead as far as how I would expect a club to be on a Saturday night. It might be because it caters to a small population and there was another alternative show going on elsewhere in the valley.\n\nThe interior blew me away! I thought it was going to be like some cheesy Haunted House and it was more like a beautiful Vampieric Church.\n\nThe bathrooms are shared but not in a bad way. It still feels safe and private to use the bathroom.\n\nThe dance floor is small but that's ok cause I don't enjoy dancing in the style the attendees chose. But, I did try my hand at it and being on the dance floor was quite fun.\n\nThe music was better than I expected. Being a goth who is a fan of the Top 20 is hard for me to go to goth themed clubs.\n\nI love the seating areas. There are bleachers on which you can sit and overlook the club as well and comfy couches by the bar. It was nice to just sit around and chat wile people watching.\n\nI don't think I will go again till I can get a group of friends together or till there is an event and I know there will be a larger crowd.
5	I live right around the corner from Frasher's and up until yesterday have only gone there to get a drink and after finally getting some food there, I'm angry at myself for not eating here sooner. I ordered a strip steak to which they prepared at exactly the way I requested it, medium rare, and it was simply delicious. Coupled with a baked potato and garlic mashed potatoes (I know, I'm weird) the meal and the company I was with we're simply amazing. I'll definitely be back.
5	There really are few words to describe how perfect the food is, how delectable the salas are, how great the waitstaff is, and how awesome the vibe is. Sufficeth to say, we come here at least twice a month (we have to hold ourselves back!).\n\nSince my husband's from SoCal and I'm a born and bred Austinite, we both grew up eating delicious Mexican food. But I have to say that La Condesa truly beats out even my favorite spots in San Diego or Austin (sorry, hometown! you still have the best migas!). They are truly Taco Royalty.\n\nOur favorite tacos: Mayan Cochinita Pibil, Arrachera (carne asada), the El Guacho, and the shark taco. Also, you must try their margaritas and horchata!
5	"""This place effing rocks!  Boylan, Moxie, Faygo, Dad's, Fentimans, Kutztown Soda Works and more!  Like 1400 kinds of bevvies!\n\nSince moving from my native Pennsylvania Dutch country I've had a dickens of a time finding birch beer anywhere.  These guys have multiple different kinds and I grabbed a bottle of each to sample.  I also got some dry & extra dry ginger ales and the BF got a Fentimans Curiosity Cola and a Faygo Rock & Rye (cream soda). Everything so far has been amazing!!\n\nEver since a transatlantic flight about 15 years ago when I had my frist taste of Canada Dry \Extra Dry \""""Ginger ALe (in the red can) I have been on the hunt for extra dry ginger ales domestically. While Pop didnt have that particular kind, they offer an impressive assortment of indie brews, hard to find sodas, nostalgic bevvies, lots of cane sugar sodas (as opposed to the high fructose schlock forced upon us elsewhere).  They had a wide selection of European bevvies and many kinds of ginger beer (Moscow Mule, anyone??)  Lots of diet sodas too if you have \""""the betes\"""" and can't drink sugar anymore. \n\nYou can sample sodas by buying just a bottle of each or buy things by the case.  Most beverages ran around $1.20 per bottle which is totally right on for mixing and matching 'til your heart's content.  They have shelves of product and lots of different drinks in coolers to grab one and go -- or sit at one of the parlour tables out front, relax in the sun and enjoy a refreshing ice cold sodee-pop!\n\nWhoever stared this store is a luminary and a God send and deserves to be knighted by the Queen."""""""
2	"""As a disabled veteran, I received donated passes for an event here. Upon arrival, I told the box office I was having a hard time walking, and asked that they assign me seats that didn't involve stairs. I made it very clear to her that I was not asking for \preferential seating\"""", just anything with as few stairs as possible. She said the best she could do was put me in seat 1 at the very end of the row.\n\nShe gave me the tickets and told me to take the escalators to the left... so after walking all the way down the concourse we found out those were the ones coming down, and the one's going up were on the opposite end. Not one staff member offered help, or asked if I needed assistance getting to my seats. (In contrast, US Airways Center staff have always been amazingly helpful.)\n\nSo we finally make it up two escalators only to find out they put me in Section 203, Row A, Seat 1. TOP LEVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF A  FLIGHT OF STAIRS. In addition, none of the concession stands were open on that side of the arena.\n\nMy kids and I walked to the opposite side of the arena to get something for all of us to drink ($5.75 for a 20oz bottle of Diet Pepsi). When we got there, we noticed over 3/4 of the seats were empty, so I asked to sit at the very top of Section 214 in a bunch of empty folding chairs. Mind you, the seats I was given were in the FRONT row of the top section... I asked if we could sit in the TOP row. I was given plenty of attitude by the usher, but was allowed. However, my two friends, my kids, and I were given dirty looks, and harassed about everything and anything by the usher.\n\nWell, one thing I can say for social media... is that it certainly got SOMEONE'S attention that day. My friends and I started posting about the way we were being treated, and sure enough a supervisor came up and moved the usher to another section. About an hour later, she returned to our section... all smiles.\n\nI understand that some people with disabilities abuse the kindness of others, but when a guy asks to sit in WORSE seats than what he has tickets for... he's probably not one of those people."""""""
5	If I could afford it, I would live here. They've got everything!\n\nGourmet bakery (cases and cases of handmade pastries), local gelato (yum), espresso bar, sushi bar, fine alcohols, outdoor seating next to the BBQ lunch bar, nice produce, lots of meat choices (sadly, no buffalo though) nice people! \n\nDon't get up here very often, but last summer I spent a lot of time outside in their bistro tables, working on my microbiology homework. The outside area was the perfect setting for an iced latte, a muffin, and some hardcore learnin' about microbes.
4	"""So we went here on Monday to celebrate another milestone in my sweetheart's life. The staff there is awesome and even changed the channel for us to catch a little Monday Night Football as we did our unedited (and OH so funny) version of \Oh My God What Is S/He Wearing, Volume 2\"""". \n\nI am a BIG fan of their Thai Sweet Chili Hot Vings. Those get 4.5 stars easily!\n\nWe also had the edamame with their signature spice rub (very yummy, but towards the end it was a teensy bit *greasy* for my taste), the flatbread pizza w/ tandoori chicken, and the banana-nut bread pudding w/ ice cream.  \n\nI wasn't very impressed with the bread pudding, don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but I didn't think it was very flavorful, and I'm always on the lookout for the perfect one. (*note* If there is even the HINT of a raisin in the bread pudding, I will not go near it. I like raisins, some of my best friends are raisins, or something to that effect...just not in my bread *giggle*) \n\nI love the atmosphere here, it is a GREAT place to do some people watching, the patio is awesome, although I refuse to sit on ANY patio between July and September here...I'm already hot-blooded, I don't need to be reheated in any shape or fashion! \n\nGreat place, great atmosphere, I'm a fan."""""""
5	Carolina's is one of my Top Ten reasons I don't leave AZ. \n\nI've always dreamed of living near the beach and maybe someday I will. Until then, I keep a list of things I would miss if I left AZ. Carolina's Mexican Food is always in my Top Ten. \n\nYes, the place is a dive and the line can be long, but the amazing authentic Mexican food and incredibly cheap prices more than makes up for it. The hard machaca beef tacos are my favorite. Anything with their machaca beef is outstanding: slow-cooked, seasoned, and shredded to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. It's available with green chile peppers, red chile peppers, or plain. It's served in a taco, a burrito, or anyway you'd like. Sour cream and guacamole are great extras. \n\nAnother important tip: Carolina's freshly made tortillas are legendary. Be sure to take a dozen home. They're homemade and served warm in a plastic bag. If you're like me, you'll only have 9 or 10 left by then time you drive home.
5	This is absolutely my favorite Mexican food restaurant. I live in Flagstaff but eat here every time I am in the Phoenix area. I have tried several menu items and they are all amazing! Everything was always fresh, including the salsas. Tried several of the flavored margaritas and loved them. I don't normally order dessert but was told the cream cheese & carmel mini chimis (with ice cream) were not to be passed up. I was not dissappointed! \n\nThe staff is super friendly and very attentive. Can't wait for my next visit!
3	Was craving Chinese and relied on Yelp to point me here. A bit out of the way, but I figured I'd give it a shot. It's not like I have many great Chinese options nearby.\n\nLooks like most of their traffic was take-out and delivery, place was empty on a Saturday night. It's a walk in, place your order at the counter and we'll bring it out when it's ready kind of restaurant.\n\nWon Ton soup was good, as were the egg roll, crab rangoon and pot stickers. I'd rate them as average, nothing more but definitely not less.\n\nMain dishes were honey chicken (son had them leave out the spice), Teriyaki Chicken (daughter wanted this with dark meat), Mongolian beef and Kung Pao chicken and shrimp.\n\nI know the kids didn't really order Chinese, but they liked their meals and I thought they tasted fine for what they were. Kung Pao was good and the Mongolian was ok. A bit black peppery and sweet moreso than spicy.\n\nPrice was ok for what we ordered off the dinner menu and we did leave with leftovers.\n\nAll-in-all this was a Yelper disappointment for me as the place was rated as if it were a great place and it was merely ok.  If I happened to be in the area I'd do lunch. If I lived nearby and wanted to order out, would do so. But won't specifically head here.
5	This place really doesn't have a novel business idea, it's just sandwiches.  But they do it well.  Probably some of the best sub sandwiches I've ever had.  I think the key is to just keep it simple.  And FRESH.  The ingredients look, taste and feel fresh and of a high quality.  Their prices are very reasonable. $5.50 for a footlong sandwich is on par with Subway's $5 footlong but this tastes better in my opinion.  Their bread is fresh and soft, not stale and crunchy like Subway.  Also, their tomatoes are red not green like Subway.  It helps that they don't have mildy retarded people and ex prisoners working there like does either.  All employees here have all their teeth and at least an average IQ from what I can tell.  Keep up the good work Goodcents, I will be coming back!\n\n-The Duke of Goodcents
3	I love greek food, and I love big portions, but yet I would still just rate this place 3 stars. The best part was our starter, which was the hummus sampler. Each hummus was tasty and flavorful. They were sort of skimping on the pita bread, but did not hesitate to bring us more when we asked. I ordered the falafel gyro, and it was good, but not great. I've definitely had better- even at the chain Pita Jungle. My dad ordered the Moussaka, and he thought it was delicious. Maybe if I come back, I will order that instead? My favorite part of the meal, as ridiculous as it sounds, was the massive water glasses. I guess I consume a lot of water with my meals, and always feel like I have to bug the servers to bring me more. Well that's definitely not an issue here! Overall, A-OK pretty much sums it up.
4	I always vowed I would never own IKEA furniture.\nMy perception being that it was cheap, Swedish crap. Generic. Frustrating to assemble.\n\nI recently bought a new house and I had very specific things in mind for new furniture. I looked everywhere, but in the end, I purchased my furniture at IKEA. \nNot only was it what I was looking for, but it fit my budget. Luckily I have an intelligent, handy man who can figure out the instructions and put together the furniture in a snap! My living room was set in a matter of hours. \n\nThis store is pretty clean, but sometimes finding an IKEA employee to help was difficult. I went on a Sat & Sun during back to school time, but expected it to be busier. I'd buy from IKEA again.
3	I flew into Scottsdale yesterday to spend the day with my aunt who turned 90.  Having a hankering for real deli, we chased on over to Chompies.\n\nI had a half corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup.  The tasty corned beef was lean and thinly sliced and piled high.  The rye bread was soggy on the bottom.  The lean corned beef is probably healthier than the marbled kind, but that is what you can get in LA and New York and it is sooo good.\n\nThe matzo ball soup had a few carrots and noodles, but the soup itself was nothing to write home to mom about.  The matzo ball was fluffy and comfortable.
5	Um hello? You're telling me that all my friends can run their tabs through the roof on expensive wine and I can order malt liquor in a bag for $1.50? I'm in. Very interesting menu and in a good way. I got the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll and absolutely loved it. The pinnacle though should mean more coming from me because I don't care for sweets. Their dessert menu is out of this world. From caramel creme brule to monkey bread. I love this place and the live music that comes with it.
3	"""So i read all the glowing reviews of this place, and knowing the history of the joint, i was excited to try out the new place. \n\nAs Richard Attenborough would say, they \spared no expense\"""" in the remodel. They've transformed a generic Joey's of Chicago into a classy, snappy decor, with a twist on the unisex bathrooms. The patio outside is very welcoming when the weather permits and they did throw in a couple of TVs to catch the game.  They've added the prerequisite in Arcadia, dual garage door that opens the bar onto the patio. Should be a nice touch in a few months. \n\nWe were greeted promptly and found a nice hi-top in the bar area. The wine and beer list is extensive. We were informed of the happy hour specials and decided that would be our focus for this visit. \n\nWe started with their Dulce Camarones---small lightly battered fried shrimp with slice veggie garnish on a bed of lettuce with aioli. This dish was disappointing, the shrimp was small and had a very mild taste. The aioli was the strongest flavor by far, and that was muted. Then we tried the Carne Tacos and the pork tacos. The carne was moist, and delicious, the pork was mediocre. Each order came with three tacos, which were 2-3 bites each. \n\nWe finished off with  Alitas (Grilled Wings) coated with Habanero glaze. These had a pleasant yet mild flavor, but not as spicy as I had hoped\n\nSo why the three stars? Well I'd give them 2.5 if I could. Maybe my expectations were too high based upon the previous reviews. We spent 34 dollars including tip, and didn't order any drinks. Meh, I expected and wanted more from my visit."""""""
5	This is my favorite bar of all time. So, so much to say so I'll try and break it down into a few categories:\n\n1. Price - Prices here are fantastic. There are random specials throughout the week, but almost everything is at a good price. Plus, they don't make drinks here like other places that pour a shot into a shot glass first to make sure you're not getting more than you paid for. You'll be pleasantly surprised. Bottles, pitchers, mixed drinks, etc are all pretty well priced. \n\n2. Pool - there are probably 7-10 pool tables and are taken care of pretty well. I was more of a pingpong guy but that is no longer existent in Docs :( There are also a few video games that can be fun here and there. \n\n3. TV's - There are TV's everywhere(inside and outside). They have all the sports packages so you can see any game you want. The only time they won't put a specific game on for you is if it's something crazy like Sunday during the NFL season when there are hundreds of people there. \n\n4. Food - Pretty good bar food actually. I believe they won an award for best Sports Bar Food in Tempe in '08. I didn't have anything that left me unsatisfied. I think the kitchen closes at ten. \n\n5. Layout - The bar is pretty fucking big which makes getting around quite comfortable even on busy nights. The outside patio area can get packed a bit but you can always go out front(without your drink) or go with the flow and enjoy yourself with the 3 tv's outside. \n\n6. Staff - I love these people. I showed up to that bar the day after I turned 21. I left AZ at 24 and almost all of these guys I consider friends and hang out with them occasionally outside of Docs. BE NICE TO THE BARTENDERS AND WAITRESSES. There are always drunken shitheads that make everyone annoyed and the staff(believe it or not) are sober and therefore have much less patience than we do as consumers. If you treat the staff right, they will treat you right and the bar will most likely become your second home. Oh, and Beasly and Austin are HUGE Ohio State Buckeye fans. Mention that to them.\n\n7. Atmosphere - Docs is the perfect place to go with a group of friends to simply get drunk and have some conversation. The Jukebox there is one of those online touch screen machines and you definitely won't see groups of people dancing with their shirts undone. There is always something to do there.\nThursday, Friday and Saturday nights are the most busy, but randomly the other days of week will have a good turn out too. \nThe ratio guys to girls is pretty even on the busy nights too which is nice. I met quite a few girls at that bar. \nThen there are the event days - UFC fights are always a good turnout and are replayed later after 12 I think, NFL Sunday and MNF are crazy as hell and I advise to get there early or sleep with Austin to get a good spot, college football Saturday daytime is hit or miss but they will put on whatever game you want and I know they open up early for the Ohio State fans. \n\nConclusion - If you want to go out and get some drinks but don't want to have bad techno and auto-tune songs blasting you for 4 hours and overpaying or light drinks all after paying a 5 dollar cover and waiting in line... give Docs a try. Pool, arcade basketball, video games, quality drinks at good prices, very fast and knowledgeable staff, TV's everywhere, good crowds, the occasional appearance from Dane M., a wide range of good music, and the cutest bar tenders in town(Beasly, Tim, Austin - I'm talkin about you guys). I miss Docs and wish I lived next door to them again.
3	This place has superb service. I've been there three times and the wait staff is always friendly and personable. The location is cool and the spacious area is bright, and great to eat in. \n\nUnfortunately, the times I've been there, the food wasn't so good. The dolmades I had were mushy and too sour. The pasta salad was incredibly bland. The gambas con ajo was better, but not at all special. The mozzarella, tomato and basil wasn't too good, either. The mozzarella tasted old...\n\nThe atmosphere is friendly enough that you can go and have a drink and get a quick bite, as long as you stick with the hummus...
5	I've now eaten at The Vig twice - once for Sunday lunch, and most recently, for dinner during a weeknight. I thoroughly enjoyed both my meals. \n\nThe food is good and priced right, and the waitstaff is very friendly. While the place is definitely noisy at night, this didn't bother me. Perhaps this was because I was sipping The Vig's great Bloody Mary's throughout the meal, but I was fine with the noise. \n\nI've not yet eaten out on the patio, but plan to do so. And I hear the place has a pet cat. Definitely want to return for the cat - and the sweet potato fries. :)
3	"""Went here today, I hadn't been to the dentist in while.  I was totally turned off when I mapped them and discovered that it was in the strip mall by my house, but I don't have a car, so my hand is pretty forced in the way of convenience.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience.  The local is next to a tanning salon and a chinese restaurant, so it is rather off-putting, to say the least.  Besides location, they have many good things going for them.  They are well stocked with up-to-date computer systems and tools.  They take every insurance they can, and also take the \Vital Savings\"""" program that comes with being a .5 T.A. at ASU.\n\nI got some x-rays and a cleaning.  The dentist was very nice and extremely gentle.   The hygienist was pretty good, no real complaints, no overt exceptional qualities.\n\nPretty cheap if you have coverage, non-invasive overall.  They use computer Xrays and show you your teeth as they diagnose you.  \n\nNo Cavities for me!  Now, a quick jaunt to Cornish Pasty... yes, the strip mall thing is still weird to me."""""""
3	The location offers a convenient source of Pho when I don't want to drive as far south as Noodles Ranch.  The atmosphere has a bit to be desired as the interior of the restaurant is very plain and inexpensively furnished.  The veggie spring rolls are generally quite fresh and come with the standard peanut sauce.  The veggie Pho here, though, is really just rice noodles with tofu (because I asked to add this) without anything like broccoli or bok choy as Noodles Ranch serves.  Saigon does offer the same plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, and cilantro, and the Pho generally tastes good but is not the best I've ever had. \n\nI also made the mistake of ordering a glass of wine here when my husband and I dined here one evening.  Now, I realize that this is not the type of place that would even have a wine list and was not surprised that my options were basically house red or white wine by the glass.  What I do expect, though, is that if a place is going to serve wine, that they at least have enough taste to discard wine that has been opened for a week or more, which was the case with the glass of white wine that I was served.  It literally tasted like vinegar and I didn't drink it.\n\nI've stopped in to pick up take-out orders several times and am somewhat concerned about the overall cleanliness of this place which makes me wonder a bit about what the kitchen is really like.  Twice now when the staff has brought out my order and placed it on one of the tables near the cash register, when I walked over to the table to retrieve my order after paying, my shoes literally stuck to the floor.  I don't mean that it kind of felt like something may be on the floor, I mean that while wearing sandals, my shoes almost came off when I tried to take a step because the floor had a stickiness factor equivalent to that of duct tape.  Now that I've noticed that, I would be a bit reluctant to dine in again since I am definitely a cleanliness freak when it comes to restaurants and just knowing that the floor isn't clean would really creep me out to eat there.
5	Wow, there are many in-depth reviews on here so I won't go into detail -- just wanted to give a shout out after my awesome experience here last night.  I think I may have a new favorite restaurant!\n\nWe came for the Yelp Restaurant Week menu, but ended up spending quite a bit of time in the bar area before our reservation.  Two rounds of Shochu (HIGHLY recommend the nectarine, so light and clean) and 3 apps later (the butterfish tataki changed my life), we made our way to dinner.  I have to admit that the apps shined above our entrees (salmon terriyaki), but because we had a limited entree menu with the scorching Yelp deal I am not going to fault Roka Akor for that.\n\nAll-in-all, just a great experience.  I loved the cool and contemporary atmosphere with all the energy and light -- the vibe is just fantastic.  I will definitely be returning and will put this in the portfolio as a great place for either business dinners or drink/app dates.  Instant fan.
4	This review is solely based on a mid-week work lunch. I would not go to Thai Hut for dinner (not much of a vibe), but if you work downtown and want to splurge on a quick Thai lunch - this is your spot. It's speedy fast. There's a nice list of lunch specials to choose from and you'll have your soup and spring roll the minute you sit down and a gigantic drink (so you're never waiting on refills). I've never walked away unhappy. The food is tasty and the price is right.
5	"""I love going here to drink wine - lots of options by the glass that are extremely well priced (many $5/glass options that are healthy pours) as well as cheap bottle prices (small markup over retail).\n\nDefinitely a great \chill\"""" place to go with friends, sip on some wine, order some nibbles (lots of great cheese!) and shoot the shit for a few hours.\n\nAlso an amazing selection of wines - a great place to experiment and try new things. My suggestion is to belly up to the bar and get recommendations from the bartender on what to try - they'll ask you what you like and then give you something creative that will fit that general palette.\n\nBig ups to Sportmans!"""""""
4	"""My coworkers and I work in Chandler, but stay in Scottsdale, so we NEVER go out after work in Chandler...however, after San Tan, I think we may need to start! I had no idea there was such a cute little downtown area, and the Chandlerians I was with informed me that there were a number of good restaurants in close proximity to San Tan that I really should try. Wow...the more you know, right?\n\nWe ended up sitting outside (in July), but it wasn't as miserable as you might think...they were able to keep it mysteriously cool, and I was comfortable throughout the entire meal. My friends told me that the building where San Tan currently resides was once a bank, which only added to the charm of the brink building. In fact, if you take a trip to the restrooms, you can see vestiges of the building's former life in the rather impressive-looking vault door leading to what is now, apparently, the restaurant manager's office. Very cool.\n\nOn to the beer! I ordered the Sunspot Gold, which is an American take on a traditional Czech Pilsener that distinguishes itself by being \infinitely drinkable\"""", according to its menu description. Infinitely drinkable is right! It was love at first sip, and it only continued as the drinking continued, to the point that I couldn't bear to order anything else on my second go-round. SO GOOD. I think I can even, with a relative degree of certainty, say that it is probably the best beer I've ever had...at least as far as my taste buds are concerned. \n\nAs for the chow, we started with the soft pub pretzels, which were fabulous...I mean, come on, it's a soft, warm pretzel served with warm cheese...what's NOT to love?!? Seriously, though...order these. You won't regret it. For my entree, I ordered the Naked Burger (with cheese!), and I enjoyed it a lot. It wasn't particularly memorable, but I'm pretty sure I polished it off, no problem, so...can I really complain? The fries were just ok...hmm, how do I describe them? They were kind of the steak-fry version of Arby's fries, which...I've just never really loved the texture of. Anyway, that's a personal preference, so whatever.\n\nAll in all, very good. I want to go back with my coworkers, if for no other reason than the great BEER. And PRETZELS. Mmmm...yummy..."""""""
1	The place is called DESERT PEAKS now. I and 3 coworkers went yesterday for lunch. Our company relocated our office off of McKellips. We have been trying to look for a good lunch place. DESERT PEAKS has now been crossed off our list. We must have gotten the hemorrhoid waitress also. She was not attentive to our needs at all. She was more concerned on flirting for tips with her bar patrons. It took 30 min for us to receive our food. (there was only one other table for 2 seated) When she brought our food out to us she placed it in front of us and immediately turned and walked off. She did not ask if everything looked ok or if she could bring us anything else. I actually  did need sauce and cheese for my italian sausage sandwich and my friend needed ranch for her fries. I sat without touching my meal hoping she would come and check on us. The waitress never came back. After 15 minutes my friend finally got her attention to come to the table. I asked for my sauce & cheese and ranch. She took my plate. Then came back said she forgot what the other request was. We told her ranch. She brought back the ranch and my plate. My fries were now cold. One of my friends had pizza. His dough was not baked in the middle. It was very soggy and alot of grease was formed on the top from the pepperoni. It was a HORRIBLE experience. She was a crappy waitress and the food was less than average. This is coming from someone that eats lunch out 5 times a week.
5	Hello there Siobhan!  I have received a confirmation email from my attorney has to how much she and her family loved the brownies.  Her question was . . . where did I find you and I had to laugh since it was based on your Groupon deal.  Now I am going to have to order some myself as they really must be something.\n\nI will keep you in my arsenal for future gifts and thank you so much doing a wonderful job.\n\nNow take a bow and pat yourself on the back for doing such a great job!\n\nAnd yes -- I will be getting back to you soon with more orders.\n\nHappy 4th of July Weekend and keep everyone believing in fairytales as apparently they really do come true!\n\nAnne Morris
5	"""I was looking for a new place to grab some food and was scrolling down the New Times \Best of List\"""" and saw Maui Dog. I was instantly reminded of a visit to Kauai and the amazing Pukka Dog establishment. I checked their menu online and was sold. \n\nThe building is quaint and reminiscent of a hot dog shack in Hawaii. There is indoor and outdoor seating. A small TV and Wifi. The Hana dog was amazing: avocado, bacon, pico de gallo, cilantro, and added maui mustard. I can't wait to go back. Loved the fruit infused mustard and other tropical toppings. \n\nThe owner was the cashier and after we finished eating he sat down and chatted with us for a bit. It was our first time dining there, and he welcomed us, and we talked about Pukka dog and his inspiration for his island dogs. Very friendly and welcoming, and it added that extra element that is missing in so many restaurants. \n\nAll together it was a solid meal, reasonable prices, and awesome staff. 5 stars all the way. I can't wait to go back and try another dog."""""""
4	WestWorld is cool because they're always doing something new or hosting a different event.  They're not just rodeos and horse shows (although they have a ton of those), they also host dog shows, baby shopping extravaganzas, girls night out shopping extravaganzas, charity events, music festivals, car shows, exhibits and much more.\n\nIt's such a big place, they definitely have the capacity to pull off pretty much any event and they always have food stands or catering (depending on the event) for any hungry guests as well as wine/cocktails most of the time too.\n\nYou can check out their calendar of events at \nhttp://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/westworld/events.asp
5	This place is a great restaurant for one of those beautiful Phoenix afternoons/evenings. The outside patio is very comfortable to eat and the view is great. We've gotten several different plates and there's nothing we haven't liked. The service is amazing!! One time, we asked for a spicy dish, and the waitress asked if it was spicy enough and my husband said no, but it tasted great anyway, and the chef himself came out to apologize and told us that next time he'd make it really spicy. Who does that anymore?? We really appreciated the gesture.
4	It's restaurant week, and I finally had the opportunity to try Beckett's Table. Having read so many good reviews, I decided to book a reservation here to take my mom out.\n\nI carefully inspected their prefixed menu, and was elated to see that they offered a vegetarian option.\n\nFor our main course, my mom tried the chicken meatballs which, unfortunately, was not a fan because of the onions and peppery taste. (I guess she didn't look at the menu)\n\nI ordered the vegetable salad with champagne  vinaigrette, which was fine.\n\nFor the main course, mom got the meat loaf, and I ordered the vegetarian mushroom lasagna (their vegetarian option).\n\nMy mom said the entree was delicious and not greasy unlike other meat loafs she had tasted.\n\nMy lasagna was decent, but I wish the vegetarian option wasn't a pasta dish.   I've been eating pasta this whole week, so I was sort of  sick of it.  A Total overload!\n\nNow as far as the service goes, it was great. Our server Michael did a great job explaining the menu, and the waiter's assistant kept our beverage full.\n\nMy only fret is where they sat us. They gave us a table smack in the center of the restaurant, so regrettably, I could not provide pictures. Next time I'm going to ask for  patio seating now that the weather is getting cooler.
3	"""I hadn't been to one of these places where the food is actually cooked in front of you.  Ultimately, it allows you to really get into how this restaurant works, but it kind of backfires:  I know enough to cook Japanese-style now for about 1/10th the price.   \n\nThe layout here is kind of weird.  Forget anything intimate--I was kind of fearing the placement of our largely dysfunctional get together near the rather normal couple, but it worked out well enough.   Problems arise in the layout of the place--everybody faces out a window with the majority having their backs to the entrances (I hate that).  The \view\"""" is a massive parking lot bookended by a La-Z-Boy store and a Chili's.  Switching the layout of the place might have been a small salvation.  \n\nWhat you're really getting is the cooking show, worthy of a sixth star:  our chef was extremely friendly and we had a great time as our food was cooked.  \n\nBut it's not a grand luxury, it's just Eastern efficiency.  You don't wait for your food, they don't have to hire expos, and they need less kitchen infrastructure.  As soon as the food is done, it's on your plate--the tradeoff of the show as I would have liked to have it all out at the same time.   Something is slightly taken away from it when the other chef on the other table does the train sound again with his butcher knife; It feels like a pre-programmed repertoire to go with the pre-programmed food.  This is why chains leave me bitter, even good ones like Benihana.   \n\nThe ingredients are nothing special--for a table of 7 they bust out a few zucchinis, a couple handfuls of generic white mushrooms, a couple white onions, small slabs of steak and chicken, etc.  What really gives this place its Denny's-plus quality was immediately apparent in the side salad--a bag of store bought mix and a couple tomatoes.  It appears to add up to a lot of food, but I've spent less at other restaurants and usually bring home a box.  \n\nThe sauces they use are what saves the place food wise, but they're all clearly pre-made elsewhere for a generic nationwide palette--the hot mustard just wasn't hot, at all.  On the other hand, the two ginger sauces, a red one in the meat and a yellow one in the salad were absolutely delicious.\n\nUnfortunately, this place severely loses on price and service.  The server was basically gone the whole time.  Fuck her.  She splits her tip with the awesome chef and drags his performance down.  \n\nAt one point I got up and went back to the front end to ask for the bathroom, waiting impatiently for the hostess to finish chatting with a friend who came in with another table.  What the hell?  The bathroom itself was a sticky-floored mess--something I would expect at Veterans Memorial Coliseum or some douchebag bar, not a place that charges this much for dinner.  Drinks were extremely expensive, charging $9 for a 22-oz bottle of beer.   \n\nThe magic here is the presentation, the sauce, and the overall delivery, but it's severely hampered by food quality, prices, and poor service.  It would have been two stars, but I couldn't be angry at the place after having such wonderful ice cream and a picture (scantly offered as it were) at the end.  \n\nOverall, Benihana is worth the one-time experience but needs significant improvement to happily lure me back as a repeat customer."""""""
1	Let's just say, you get what you pay for.  Thankfully we walked in and were seated and walked out after walking through the food lines to see what was being offered.  \n\nThe restaurant was dirty and the food appeared disgusting.  The hot food looked like fried sludge.  Sushi appeared as if it had been sitting there too long and just of extreme poor quality and limited offerings.\n\nI would recommend that you go to a sit down restaurant and order quality food.  But then again, if you think that Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral is quality food, then this place might be up your beaten path.  \n\nI've never given a terrible review to anyone, but there is always a first time.
3	Service is good, they have a wide variety of desserts. It seems they lack meat though. The basic boneless chicken breast is nowhere to be found. For dinner , they should have more seafoods. I dint see mussels, crab legs, crabs. But they had shrimp and oysters. They had steak and lamb which was good too, salmon was overcooked it was really dry and chewy. I liked the steamed pollock ( not sure but it was white fish ) with veggies and rice. The ambiance is good, too. \n\nTip: when you do dinner, get there as early as 4:30pm,  yes, when they just barely open, especially if you are starving else you would have to wait before the other 25-30 people can get in.
3	"""I couldn't decide between the one star experience of going to Phoenix, or the blessed five star experience of leaving.  Three stars it is.\n\nCoincidentally enough, it is pretty accurate as it is an average airport full of pissed off people who could not care less if you're getting what you need from them or not.\n\nAsk any of them.  They very well may tell you \I'm in the union.  You can blow me.\"""" if you have a simple request for them.\n\nHere's a perfect example.  I came to the airport to catch a red-eye one night.  Apparently the flight was oversold, as can happen, so they closed ticketing and left.  One problem.  The flight wasn't leaving for another hour and a half.\n\nOnce I figured out that it was party time in the back, I knocked on the door.  They came out and were very clear that I was a huge asshole for interrupting their party.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't make it on my flight and customer service for the airline believed them when they told them that I was late in checking in, so they wanted $150 to change my flight.\n\nThis is par for Phoenix customer service.  Their motto is either:\n\""""I don't care and fuck you for asking.\""""\nor\n\""""We're not happy until you're not happy.\"""""""""""
4	Ghost town hmmm.   seems like a tourist trap, one of those silly things to do...well yes and no.  I go down to this area a couple times of year and somehow always  enjoy going to Goldfield.  The bakery has great cinnamon rolls and frozen lemon aide.  The mug slinger has some pottery to look at and if you have small children the train is a big hit.   \n\nIt feels like an old western mine town with lots of character.  Take your family and spend a few hours here and enjoy yourself .  It is a fun few hours.
1	No more! We have been regular customers for about five years now and were so treated like crap tonight that we will not be coming back. Service and food is always pretty hit and miss but we kept coming back because when it was good, it was good. We ordered their filet tacos which always come out cold but the flavor is usually pretty good. Tonight it comes out not only cold but greasy and has no guacamole on it. We tell the waitress and she sends it back. A little later she brings out a new dish that had the tacos so cold that the cheese was not even melted, barely any meat on it, and the guacamole and pico de gallo on the side. Huh? We complain, she sends the manager over and she (the manager) who has known us for a few years now is very snarky and rude to us about it. She doesn't understand why we are not happy with everything on the side. OK. Well, if that is how you treat regulars, see ya. To top it off, we were overcharged for the side of guacamole we ordered and the service was terrible the second half of our meal. We canceled the order and left. This is a place you definitely take your chances at.
1	I have no idea why so many people go to this place.  Everything's so expensive, they never have any great deals and the food is mediocre at best.  My friend and I had 1 plate of nachos (appetizer) and 3 beers and the total came out to 30 dollars.  On top of this, the gratuity was added and the waitress didn't say anything so we accidentally tipped her more on top so we paid almost 50 dollars!  She could've let us know if she wasn't so greedy..  I tried to complain on the website but the only thing you can do is give them information to set up a party.  What a rackett!
5	"""I recently moved to South Phoenix and have explored a few of the SM trails with my dogs. I've found that the trails are very sparsely populated on week nights, but weekends bring tons of traffic. \n\nMormon trail has become my favorite, and I hike it 2 to 3 times a week. It's the most easily accessible trail (from Baseline, turn South on 24th street and it meanders to the trial's generous parking lot). The trail inclines right from the beginning, and there are very few flat parts. It's a GREAT cardio workout. The first several times I had to take a few breaks to catch my breath. It takes about 30 minutes (1 mile) to get to the part that loops to the National trail, which is where I turn around. There is usually a fair amount of traffic but everyone is super friendly. \n\nKiwanis trail is lovely (accessed via Central, followed signs). It's in a \crack\"""" between two hills, making it almost completely shaded, ideal in the summer. The shade also facilitates different plant life than on other trails. It ends with a \""""staircase\"""" that would be great training for hiking the Canyon. It leads to the road that goes up to the top of the mountain. If you cross the road, you connect with Telegraph pass on the left, or you can hike to the hut on the right. \n\nI did Holbert Trail on Silent Sunday (access via activity center). It was packed, and we were constantly passing unleashed dogs, unicyclists, large families leisurely strolling, etc. We hiked about an hour up and reached a lovely summit. The trail itself was beautiful and somewhat challenging, but I would not recommend on a weekend if serenity is what you seek. \n\nRanger trail is my favorite so far (access near Central/ mile marker 1). The views around sunset are amazing, and the switchbacks get your heart pumping, and really motivate you to see what's around the next corner. \n\nI walked Las Lomitas Loop (accessed where it intersected Ranger) for about an hour, and never found where it loops to. It was ok, lots of up and down rocky river banks, but doesn't vary much in elevation or go up the mountain (that I saw, anyway) so the views aren't as good as other trails. \n\nIn February I hiked Alta trail. My first attempt I made it about 45 minutes up and didn't feel well and turned around. My second attempt I was eager to hike the whole thing, which is 4.5 miles! Including the .5 mile walk from the parking lot and up the closed road to the trail head, it was ten miles total. The first part is kind of boring and barren, but once you get to the top you can see the city on one side and the res on the other side. The trail wanders up and down and up and winds around the mountain side. I was thankful that I brought plenty of water and my headlamp as I hiked out in the dark. I was super sore but also super proud at this accomplishment. \n\nAll of the trails are fairly well marked, well maintained, and often cross a road or two so it never feels remote (for a single woman, this is a benefit). \n\nVisit for maps and info: http://phoenix.gov/parks/hiksogud.html"""""""
5	In a day of cookie cutter restaurants and bars, San Tan Brewery is so refreshing.  First of all, it's a great place with great food and great BEER! Second, It's in a great location-downtown Chandler. I personally believe San Tan Brewery played a significant role in the come back of downtown, I know I wouldn't have been venturing down that way if they were not there.  Third, Great service.  In a world of OK service coming off as stellar, San Tan has legitimately great service.\n\nSo, its great, great , and great.  Highly recommended. (and I love Beer!)
4	This place is definitely the best sneaker store in the valley, and probably in the state. My only problem with it is that every single sneaker is marked at the highest price possible. \n\nI have been to other great sneaker stores in other cities, mainly Philly, and at least they have some sales and some sneaker prices marked down. \n\nOverall if you are alright with spending a lot of money for any pair of sneaker then this is the place, because they have a much better selection than every other store around.
4	JJ, good and fast.  From Chicago where there is a JJ every three blocks and was excited to finally find one out here.\n\nWhen I went was wearing an Iowa shirt and spoke with the owner.  His son is the manager and he plans to open another location possibly near the Midwestern campus.  Very nice employees like a lot of JJ, but liked that he was willing to talk about the operations with customers.  \n\nOnce I get back there the #10 will be devoured yet another time.
1	"""We came in here to have a few drinks before going across the street for dinner. As soon as we sat down at the bar, the bartender (who couldn't speak English very well) comes over. I immediately ask her to relay the happy hour specials. $3.99 house wines, and $2 drafts. My companion has a budlight draft, I choose a house pino grigio. We ended up staying for two rounds. The bartender disapears and we ask the \manager\"""" for the check. After he brings it over we notice that my wine was $10 a glass. After explaining to the \""""manager\"""" that we came in here for the happy hour. He says he will go ask the \""""owner\"""" in back. He comes back, shrugs his shoulders and says that there is nothing he can do. Meanwhile the bartender (who can settle this) is still nowhere to be found. I explain to him that I live very close by and usually come here to watch football on sundays, but sadly I will not be returning. He says \""""Oh.... let me ask the owner again\"""" and walks back. At that point, I had enough. It wasn't about the money. I stood up, left money on the bar and walked out. This place is a joke."""""""
4	We eat at My Thai about twice a month.  Sometimes we do carry out and other times we eat at the restaurant.  There is usually the same couple of waitstaff there.  And we are always treated very, very well.  We usually have a lot of food modifications as well....like no sugar, completely vegetarian with no oyster sauce, fish sauce, etc, and VERY spicy.  They always accommodate us and always get it right.  While this restaurant doesn't have anything specific for kids, they have a nice attitude towards kids and are friendly.  My 4 year old likes coming here and will often ask to go to My Thai.\n\nThe only reason I don't give this restaurant a 5 star rating is because I wish they could do some local sourcing for the food and/or organic.
2	It wasn't bad for what it is: pizza. Even bad pizza is pretty good.\n\nThat being said, it wasn't great. The pizza wasn't super good, and with a $75 bill for two pies, two salads, and two glasses of wine, I expect a lot more.\n\nIts a nice sit down spot, and I love the location, but a few notes:\n\n- Service isn't good.\nWe ordered two salads, two pies. Pies came out before the salads did, so our pizzas sat there and got cold while we finished our salads. I am a big fan of things being timed and plated properly. Especially when I am paying what we did for dinner.\n\nAlso, hand your customers the proper pizza box for their left-overs, not a styrofoam container. Its a classy move to give the cardboard box, and since you're trying to be a classy place, go with the solid.\n\n- Too much salt.\nThey use A LOT of salt in the dough and in the toppings. So much so that my girlfriend was having a hard time later in the night with all the sodium intake. If your food is good, you don't need that much salt to make it great. Take it down 80%.\n\n- Work on your wine list\nFor what you have, its over priced. Get something different in there, stop with the stock bottles from everywhere else in Phoenix.\n\n- Damn its loud.\nThe acoustics in there are unrelenting. If you plan on having a conversation with your date or fellow diners, try somewhere else.\n\n----\n \nLong story short, you're not Pizzeria Bianco. Stop trying to pretend to be. Go a different direction and get better at that.
4	"""This is definitely just the fast food, delivery style pizza that Lauren V. spoke of.   And she is correct, it is \some good damn pizza\"""".  The ingredients seemed fresh, the crust is terrific.  There is some substance to it.   I enjoyed the fact that is wasn't a sloppy greasy mess where all the toppings fall off when you pick it up.  I didn't have it delivered so I can't rate that aspect of the place.  But for take out pizza, if this place is close to you then you're pretty lucky and should try some."""""""
4	I have been on a quest.. a quest for the almighty bacon wrapped hot dog or the Tijuana Hot Dog aka Mexican Hot Dog.. these bad boys are so illegal one lady selling them in LA was sent to jail for 45 days! Apparently the board of health doesn't look to kindly on street vendors grilling these on the side of the road. \n\nAfter much searching on the internet for potential suitors for me quest I found this one, Mereno's in Mesa. This place isn't just in Mesa but in the part of Mesa that is well, like stepping into Little Mexico. Its awesome really.. carneceria's, Mexican food stands and of course 2 TJ hot dog joints (the second we spotted on the drive up to Moreno's).\n\nOnce there we were impressed! With all the buildings around there looking worn and tattered, Moreno's was like finding the Titty Twister in the middle of the Mexican desert, place was hopping! Of course we we're the only white boys in there but hey, if you like the looks of Latin men, well heyyyyyyyy!! \n\nWe ordered 4 dogs, a cheese quesadilla and a carne asada burro.. oh, they also have Coke and Sprite (Mexican versions) in the glass bottle! Saweet! After ordering we were told that we need to go back outside and pick up the dogs. Strange but okay.. made me a little nervous until we got outside and there was a street cart.. this guy was the hot dog monster! He had 4 made with all the toppings (beans, onions, salsa, etc) but to or disappointment the dogs weren't wrapped in bacon. Apparently the AZ board of health got to this place as well. The bacon was chopped and put into the hot dog boat (bun with a slit only in the center).  \n\nWhen we got inside we grabbed a booth and took in the surroundings. This place is actually pretty decent. Super clean, very comfortable and a nice salsa bar close to the counter. They had avocado cream, 2 kinds of salsa as well as cucumbers and radishes plus limes.  We of course we to town, I love 'salad' with my Mexican food! Once we were set up we tore into the dogs! They were fantastic.. the flavors and textures were as comforting as they were somehow exotic. Mayonnaise with salsa and bean, who knew?\n\nThe burro and the quesadila showed shortly after a few minutes. Oh the quesadilla.. super crispy and cheesy! The carne asada burro was huge! Surprisingly packed full of meat, pico de gallo and rice.. Ive never had one this way but I cant believe what Ive been missing all these years! Tender, salty, a little spicy (additional salsa) and slightly creamy as the rice was done very well! \n\nAs we waddled out of there and made it to the car we knew that we will certainly be coming back! On the way west to the 101 we noticed about 4 different street carts, all serving the same thing.. those yummy TJ hot dogs!\n\nAnyone up for a crawl? Who knows, maybe one will be wrapped in bacon?
2	"""I wanted very much to be able to give this restaurant a favorable review.  However, my experience lately has been less than stellar and my friends have all had similar experiences.  My friend invited me to dinner here a few nights ago, and I was reluctant to go back after a bad experience previously but thought I'd give it another shot.  I ordered the \Pork Chile Verde Mac & Cheese\"""", having had it before and enjoyed it at that time.  I can't believe they charged us $14.99 for a plate of elbow macaroni with NO Pork Chile Verde in it.  Sure; the cheese sauce was \""""okay\"""" but at that price I expected meat in my dish.  I suggest that if you haven't been here before, or in a long while, you check your meal thoroughly to be sure you're getting what you ordered...  We won't be back."""""""
2	The food seemed well prepared and reasonably priced, and the portions were certainly generous. But the 2 stars is because something in their rice is sweet. I don't know if it's orange juice or what, but it tastes like they added a bunch of sugar to it. Since rice was a key ingredient in my burrito, I couldn't get past that. It really ruined the meal. If I ever go back and get something without the sweet rice, I may give more stars.
1	I can say hands down I won't be returning.  We were able to enjoy the preview weekend offered for the new Fork & Screen features, and the best thing I can say about it was I'm glad it was free.  All in all we enjoyed 2 free movie tickets, as well as free dinner and soda.  When we arrived we were helped quickly by a friendly guy who helped us get our tickets and headed to the new bar in the lobby.  I order a pomegranate martini from the menu and was shocked with the $7.99 cost arrived in the smallest martini glass I've ever seen.  In addition to being outrageously priced, which on this instance wasn't too bad since I didn't pay for much else it was terrible.  \n\nEven though we'd been told to arrive very early we were unable to actually enter our theater until 30 minutes before show time (even though the theater had been empty for nearly 40 minutes before we were able to be seated).  Once seated we experienced how close together the seats were.  I spent most of my evening being kicked, which isn't the fault of the person behind me I'm guessing she had as much foot room as I did which was none once the seat is reclined back.  Not to mention the highlight I saw on the site was about the age restrictions.  The cinama seats, which are only a few of the theaters are 21+ but the Fork and Dine theaters which I was in are 18+ or with a parent. So we had the joy of a 2 year old squeeling most of the movie which the staff (which was numerous) did nothing about.  \n\nWhen the waiter who was friendly took our order and our food arrived about 20 minutes later.  The food was about on par price and quality wise of what you would get from Applebees or TGI Fridays.  We had the potato skins (it had been FOREVER and I was excited to be able to get them without the bacon), I had the margarita pizza, one of the few vegetarian options, which was very greasy. My husband had the chicken fajita wrap which is served with very plain potato chips.  All of it was alright, nothing terrible and nothing fantastic.  About an hour into the movie, as we'd been told, the waiter brought our check over.  Personally I think this is silly what if someone wants to order something else?  About 10 minutes later he comes by to pick up the check which we had not taken care of yet, after all we're watching a movie. He then told me he'd be back in a few minutes to pick it up then.  Personally this was the low point of the evening.  I handed the check to my husband, he took care of it and we simply left.  I hate being rushed out when eating at a normal restaurant but now you're going to interrupt my movie to pay a check when I could order more, and also you can't flip my table I'm going to be here for another hour watching the movie.  I simply couldn't stand to deal with any of it any longer. \n\nLike I said at least it was free, we did the math and our total for the evening would have come to about $70.  Which the experience was no where near worth.  I'm old fashioned I guess, I'll stick to dinner and then a movie.

Have water prepared! (Amy was diligent w/ H20)\n\nI wish I could go to this place every day if I could afford to!"""""""
4	I love pizza, and I love the Brooklyn here. Sausage and basil are a beautiful combination atop the thin crust, tomato sauce, and mozzarella substrate. \n\nAll the pies are excellent actually, monstrous calzones, and salad too. It's not five star because I just don't think they were going for that sort of thing, it certainly won't break your bank with under $7 lunch specials and average priced pizzas. \n\nPossibly better than actual New York pizza, but I'll leave that up for debate.
4	I really like the Yucca Tap Room!  I've been three or four times now and always have a great time.  The bar is definitely divey and cash only (there is an ATM machine near the bathrooms but it's best to come prepared with cash beforehand).  I usually only go to Yucca to see What Laura and Black Carl (my faves), but I'd like to make more effort to check out some other local bands sometime.  From what I remember the drinks are pretty cheap ($20ish for 3 beers and 2 shots, not sure of the individual pricing since I always seem to be ordering in bulk for a small group).
5	Love this cute boutique hotel. The bed is comfy with lots of pillows, and the room has great style and function. I love that there is a Keurig in every room to make a quick cup of tea or coffee. My favorite part is the night light scented oil warmer! I enjoyed my stay here. The staff were so friendly and courteous. I enjoyed getting in the huge hot tub all by myself! I felt like I was living like a celebrity! Will definitely be back...you should check it out too!
4	"""Coming from LA where i see thai joints on every block, i decided to try this one out on my date. The food was really good! crab wontons were amazing!. I ordered the spicy noodle and the waitress asked me \do  you want american hot or thai hot?\"""" and i chose american hot just to play it safe. I totally should have went for thai hot, seeing as i asked for some sriracha on the side and dumped it all over my food :)\n\nThe place was very cute, modern, and was not loud so i was actually able to hold a great conversation on my date. \n\nDefinitely coming back here!"""""""
1	We had a problem here with a rude employee.  Unfortunately, the GM is on vacation for the next week.  I left my phone number for her but luckily the front desk mgr called me & I told her what had transpired.  So, we will be able to stay again here next year gratis.  Originally I did say that I would never come back here but I will give them a chance to make good.  Otherwise, the breakfast is ok, the evening hors d'oeuvres were missed since we got here too late.  The neighborhood is ok but centrally located.
4	There are so many good things to say about AJ's, it's hard to know where to start. Amazing meats and seafood. Great deli items. Great sushi bar. Knowledgeable staff. Fantastic produce. Gorgeous flowers. And the pastries... the list just goes on and on. \n\nThere is usually a somalier on staff to help with wine selections to go with whatever cut of meat or seafood choice you've gone with. A good mix of everyday grocery items as well as specialty items. If you can find the marinated garlic, try it! It's so so good. Try the butternut lasagna if the deli has it. And the pastries... The pastries. Cheesecakes, mini red velvet cakes, Boston Cream Pies, cupcakes, croissants, bagels... All of the highest quality. You will never have a problem finding something sweet to curb that craving, except that you may have a problem narrowing the field. \n\nNote: not every AJ's has a sushi bar, so keep that in mind if you head to a different location with a hankering for fresh sushi. \n\nNo matter what you're going in for, the friendly, helpful staff will help ensure you get exactly what you need.
5	A foreword to this review- everyone PLEASE visit Republic Ramen for my own selfish purposes.  I've been waiting forever for quality boba somewhere near me and a legit ramen place.  This is it.  Support them :-)\n\nMENU\nNoodles:\nThe complaint from serious Ramen lovers here is that the menu might be a little limited.  However, it's Arizona, they're doing what they do right, and well, it's Arizona.  With the different varieties of add-ins and their spice/sauce selection, you can pretty much have any kind of delicious ramen you want.   They have 6 standard types of broth and 9 add-ins to mix it up.  They also have 3 combo options with edamame, gyoza, and curry rice.  \nBoba: In case you haven't heard, the restaurant is split into a tea care and a noodle house.  The tea cafe has a great selection of boba flavors, tea varieties and a good solid tapica pearl (not overly sweet).  Props to the Taro- it's my favorite I've had so far which includes Chinatowns in New York, San Francisco and Seattle. They also have Snows (basically an awesome slushy) and regular teas.  \n\nDRINKS:\nSee above for the boba.  The owner said they're trying to get a liquor license and he envisions an alcoholic boba menu in the future. Whaaaat?  Best idea ever.  But, as of now, no booze.  \n\nVALUE: (hey, look! new cateogry to my reviews!)\nThe ramen is priced exactly how it should be, so long as you save the double helping for the next meal.  Don't throw it!  It's completely comparable to Ramen in bigger cities.  \n\nCLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY\nBrand new, spotless.  Great modern design and classy casual feel.  \n\nSERVICE\nThey were a bit slow for what I ordered in the tea shop but the ramen comes out really quickly.  You can also order ahead for easy takeout.  I've only eaten in-house once so my service knowledge is limited.  Their takeout is 100% dependable, however.  \n\nATMOSPHERE\nUrban casual without compromising atmosphere.  I would even take a date here- quick and funky, full of character, nice people, and definitely empty since this place is new and has trouble keeping a crowd (Again, please support- they're great!)
3	There are a lot of TVs at this place.  The TVs are playing sports of all different kinds.  If you are into this kind of thing, you will love it.  Thank God I am into this kind of thing.  The food is pretty good and above average for a sports bar.  The staff is very nice and best of all, my wife doesn't mind hanging here for awhile. They seem pretty busy and I am glad folks are supporting locals in their business.
4	This place was packed on a Tuesday night. Granted it was during Spring Training, but I don't think they have a problem filling the joint. It's got a great atmosphere. The bar seemed fun with live music playing and lots of people enjoying themselves. \n\nThe food... If you love enormous portion sizes, then this is your place. I had the petite fillet and couldn't finish it, which I was very sad about because it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. My husband had the bone in fillet, which was terrific as well. For sides we just ordered one because we knew we wouldn't be able to finish more than that. We had the crab gnocchi, which was great, but a little too rich for me -- not the restaurant's fault - bad ordering on our part. We didn't have room for dessert. Oh, one of the reasons we didn't have room for dessert is because we ate too much of the amazing bread basket they bring you. Pretzel bread, olive bread, amazing sourdough rolls - all worth trying. \nThe service was OK. Definitely some room for improvement. Overall though, the experience was good and you can't dock them for the service because the food shines. \nThis place would be great on an expense account.
2	We went here for our Anniversary yesterday, our first time to Trader Vic's.  Overall I was not impressed.  We had the Crab rangoons as an app and I found it very strange that they were served with a plate of mustard and seafood sauce, kind of weird.  I had the Passionfruit glazed chicken, which while tasty, barely had any chicken and for what it was, priced way too high.  My wife had the macadamia nut crusted mahi, the fish was very good, the brocolini cooked perfect, but the mashed potatoes were pasty and had a bitter sour aftertaste.  Desert wasn't any better, the bread pudding was dry and rubbery and obviously microwaved and the Snowball, come on 8 bucks for a scoop of ice cream rolled in coconut?  \n  Service was horrid, we felt neglected waiting for drinks and food and then rushed once our meal came.  Some kid brought us salads we never ordered and then our waitress tried to take them to the right table only to upset the people at that table (they could see the salads at our table first).  The same kid tried to deliver our app to the same table instead of us.  Waitress kept asking us if we were done and then brought the check without asking if we wanted dessert first.  The place wasn't even busy and it felt like they were trying to turn the table.  We enjoyed ourselves in spite of the food and service, because we had each other.  I would rate one star higher, but for the price I expect so much more.  Not worth it at half the price.  I will only go back if it is someone else's choice, it won't be mine.
4	"""My wife and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary here Saturday night.  We decided to pull out all the stops and do the \The Brick Oven Table\"""" thing.  They setup a nice table outside next to their brick oven and serve you an 8 course meal.  It is very intimate and if I wasn't already married my wife would have thought I was going to propose.  So if there are any guys out there looking for a good proposal spot this is probably a pretty solid place to do it.\n\nIt probably wasn't my most brilliant idea to sit outside because it was pretty hot and both of us got pretty bitten up by mosquitos and/or ants.  The hostess and waitress gave us plenty of forewarning and chances to move inside because of the heat, but we decided to stick it out because it is all part of the charm and will definitely give us an anniversary to remember.\n\nAnyway, the food was very very good.  I can't pick a favorite because it was all good.  Yes the courses are pretty small but after 8 courses I was pretty stuffed.  Nothing that was served was overly bizarre or fru fru (as some tasting menus can get).  My only complaint is that the chef has a pretty heavy hand when it comes to salt.  I mean I love salt but some of the stuff was overly salted.  Doing the sampling menu was a great experience and gave us the full range of what Quiessence has to offer.  It truly is top notch cuisine.\n\nEverybody from the hostess to the waitresses to the bus boys are all very professional, helpful and friendly.  I would recommend Quiessence to anybody looking to celebrate an occasion or just want a nice night out."""""""
1	Im going to have to agree Whole heartedly. And i informed the manager of it as well. I picked this one because it was close to the Airport and the Light Rail. The noise from the Airport wasnt to bad. But it was the Train Horns all NIGHT LONG and ALL MORNING when your trying to sleep. I wouldnt pick this one, the neighborhood wasnt bad despite what people say. But the Train noise is just unbearable. I got it for the Click 6 rate which was reasonable. Stay Elsewhere. I should of picked one further down that was right off the light rail.
5	what can one person say about food heaven on earth.....the ox tail soup is the best in the west....i am in a different world when i walk thru the doors of el rancho. i drive or fly from san diego just for the ox tail soup...........the service and the fresh food is better than some 5 star restaurants i've eaten at. again 5 stars is not enough for this place. when i die i want my ashes spread around the place.
1	"""I have been to Grimaldi's before and this was my second visit while on a date before heading to Westgate. The service was good and the food was good. However here is where the unprofessional-ism comes in. \n\nAfter dinner my GF went to the restroom, while in the restroom, a waitress approaches her with a proposition from the Manager named \Rich\"""". Stating, \""""he wanted to give her his number since he found her so attractive and wanted to know her status with the guy at the table\"""". This offended her and she declined the offer. \n\nEvidently, this is a common practice by the manager to prey on female patrons as the waitress had no problem assailing her on his behalf. My GF returned embarrassed/offended and wanted to leave immediately; she wouldn't  tell me what was wrong until we exited the restaurant, in order to prevent a scene from occurring.\n\nThe manager should really take some classes on business ethics. Patrons are there for the growth of your establishment, not for your own carnal desires."""""""
2	I went here a few weeks ago and had a pretty so so experience.  I ordered, and the price charged on the register was higher than the sign.  When I brought this to the cashier's attention they did not know how to handle it.\n\nMy order was slow, nothing special, yet three orders after mine came out ahead of mine. \n\nOnce I finally got my food it was ok, but nothing special.  They would have gotten three stars from me if the service would have been better.
4	This place is one of my of top Thai restaurant choices in the valley, specially the locations is the most convenient to me.  They have some of the best soups, my favorites are Tom Yum and Tom Ka; which I have found to be THE BEST cure for hangover; I promise; I wish they could make it spicier than 5; The yellow curry is my favorite dish, I do like to add 'deep fried' Tofu which makes it much better.  The Lard Na and the spicy noodles are very delicious. This place can get crowded during lunch time; Service has some room for improvement, overall they are very helpful food has been consistence.
3	"""Seeing so many 5-star reviews,I almost feel bad giving them only 3 stars, but - it has to be said ... \n\nThis is really a 5 star / 1 star review.  The food - undoubtedly 5 star; everything everyone says about the food is correct - fresh, top of the line, well prepared, well presented.  No question.  But - there are elements to the experience that to me completely ruin it, considering the price.  \n\n1) I call for a reservation; first a guy answers, talks to me nicely for a few minutes, then says 'let me transfer you to the hostess'; on hold listening to gibberish for a while, then; hostess asks me for my phone number ... ok, not sure why you need it but lets do it ...; \first name\"""" ... ok, I guess you want that too; \""""last name\"""" ... wtf, this is getting annoying ... but I give it anyway ... \""""can you spell that please\"""" ...OMG ... if you have my phone number, and my first name, why do you need my last name?! ... and spelled out ... ?! It's a restaurant reservation, not an airline reservation! \n\n2) We sit at the 'robato/sushi' bar.  Great view, watch all the action. Couldn't be better, except - there's an icy cold wind blowing down from the vents. Now, this is January - about 45 degrees outside. Thank goodness I was wearing a jacket and scarf, because I needed it - though I like to take off such things once I get inside.. I live in Phoenix because I LIKE THE WARMTH ... I don't want to be frozen to death while I eat (this is one of my pet peeves with many places in Phoenix ... it's as if they setup their A/C in July and just leave it on all through the winter ... either that or, the wait-staff and kitchen staff control the A/C and since they are running around being busy, they like the temp to be cold ... but we patrons are sitting idly, not exactly overheating! A new couple arrived and sat at my side, and asked 'is this cold to you?' - so this wasn't just me. \n\n3) I was in the middle of an interesting conversation with my partner, when I heard \""""pardon the interruption; may I take your plate?\"""".  The girl was a cute blonde, typical Scottsdale material.  If I'm in the middle of a conversation, I'm obviously busy, and being interrupted for the matter of a plate removal is just ... bad service.  If they are delivering hot, fresh, food, then of course interrupt me, but ... removal of empty plate? This, to me, smacks of lack of training ... any 'quality' server knows that you don't interrupt for no good reason.  We also had a few 'pardon my reach' comments, when they reached over to pour my beer. Now, if they want to avoid reaching, they could pour the beer on the serving tray, THEN reach over briefly to place on the table, but ... instead they place the empty glass on the table then lean over and pour for what seems like an age ... \n\nAgain, food was fanstastic but these things detract from the overall experience."""""""
4	Aside from debating the merits of what constitutes a four star vs. a five star review with Bonnie G and Erica O (aka Judith Light from Who's the Boss), or the Carrie Bradshaw-like storytelling from Sarah K., I can't really decide what the highlight of the evening was.  Here are the highlights of the Lost Leaf. \n\n. Great lighting, \n. Awesome hardwood floors, \n. Exposed brickwork everywhere \n. Near-perfect sound level at just the right decibel for the late 20s and 30s Downtown scenester crowd inside.\n. Art created by locals adorns the walls.  \n. Cool little side patio for smokers.\n. Diverse bottled beer selection (perhaps that's to make up for the lack of beers on tap - which is zero.\n. Awkward bar layout - that makes for difficult traffic flow to back half of bar when it's busy.\n\nYes, this is a hybrid bar - art gallery, and I like it a lot, but not enough to warrant a five star rating.  Why?  Something seems a bit lacking here and I'm not sure what it is.  Regardless, this was a great place to hold the first-ever Yelp event.  It's a great space, don't get me wrong, but I can't say enthusiastically it's five star.\n\nHere's a tip:  AVOID on a First Friday.  It's way too packed and not worth waiting in line to see and do.
5	I love hiking this mountain! For me, there is such a great feeling of accomplishment upon reaching the top. Not to mention the amazing panoramic views of the valley. It doesn't get better than that.\n\nNot only is this a great workout, but there is always a wide variety of friendly people attempting this hike. From hard-bodied, shirtless regulars to local families--it is a great place to people watch and interact. \n\nI have to also say that it is a must to bring a cooler of beers and celebrate after your hike at the base of the mountain. My friends and I decided to do this once, and a neighboring group ended up inviting us over to join them in their weekly tailgate potluck. Gotta love some good food and drinks after an exhausting workout.
4	I'm a sucker for anything even resembling Mexican food, so it was a pretty sure bet I was going to like Z'Tejas.  We went for happy hour and while I thought that 1/2 off appetizers was a great deal, I felt that the $1 off margaritas and 50 cents off beers was a little on the stingy side.  Call me cheap, but 50 cents?  I mean....c'mon!\n\nThe appetizers were yummy.  We especially liked the catfish tacos and the quesadilla.  The cornbread was delicious, as well (oh, sweet, sweet carbs....)\n\nI had heard friends RAVE about the Chambord Margaritas and let me say, mine was STRONG.  I can see why they cut you off at 3.  If I had put down a couple more of these, I wouldn't have been able to remember my name.  All in all, a great dining experience.
2	Eh. I've heard people swear by these guys, but I just can't give a good review.  The food was ok... service wasn't good... took forever to get the food.\n\nOne thing that seemed pretty weird is that they had a weight loss infomercial on the whole time.  Um... have they not heard of the psychology of the eater?  It's better to have cooking shows on to make people eat more... not weight loss! We don't want to be reminded how this pulled pork is going straight to our hips!\n\nThere are other better bbq places real close to this place.
4	We tried Crazy Jim's on a whim the other night  - Very good!!  The reviews here do not lie.  They have the softest, fluffiest, yummiest pita bread I have ever had!  It was almost like Indian fry bread... but not as fried.  Yum.\n\nWe had a couple of small pizzas, some hummus, and a side salad.  The prices were reasonable, the service was fantastic, and the food was awesome. \n\nMy only complaint about Crazy Jim's would have to be the cramped dining area.  We squeezed in between a couple on a first date and a couple who had clearly been married since time began.  An interesting dichotomy (we are newly married...), but I am one that likes a little private dinner conversation (you know?)\n\nAnyway, I think CJ's would be fantastic for lunch, takeout, or a quick low key dinner.  Go there.  Eat some yummy pita.  Leave full.
3	Craving french toast?  Look no further!  Tasty french toast with butter and maple syrup..what else do you really need!   We had the french toast, roasted potatoes, and the sausage and gravy  with biscuits..all was tasty.\n\nSweet vanilla dipped french toast..I gobbled it up and could have had another plate.  The gravy was very thick and full of sausage..and kind of spicy.  The biscuits didn't really look like biscuits more like rolls.\n\nScramble seems to get really busy on the weekends!  Long lines to wait to order and then you have to find a place to eat. We would've sat outside however, the tables were wet.   The staff was really friendly and definitely were helpful in clearing tables to get the next group seated.  However, we had a family who just kept coming and asking us to move over, very annoying.  One of the daughters almost sat on my friend's purse and was not even apologetic for doing so, and then another person came and asked us to move again.  We just ended up leaving because they were annoying for sure and I was just thinking they would have another 3 family members wanting to sit next to them and it doesnt make the best experience for other guests.  So I think somehow, Scramble needs to figure out how to manage large groups, because it was very annoying.  We would've left a tip for the girls but was just annoyed that we left since it felt like we were getting kicked out.  So , go over the week, to avoid these family groups.   \n\nScramble , I will be back but just not the weekends, I don't want to keep moving around while I'm trying to enjoy your  tasty french toast!
4	"""My husband and I have concluded that this hotel is a great get-a-way \in town\"""" establishment for us. We liked the attentive service from the polite young hipsters that work for this hotel; everyone from the valets to the \""""check-in\"""" person to the food servers in the restaurant were striving for the best in our humble opinions. It was nice to have our names remembered as we made our way around the property during the weekend. We give the service 5 stars!\n\nThe rooms were the \""""low point\"""" of the trip; although we liked the funky color and decor for the most part, I agree with a comment one reviewer mentioned regarding the bathroom door that did not shut all of the way. It seems like a minor complaint, but it does make difference on the dual counts of privacy and \""""sound barrier,\"""" as previously mentioned. We give the room 3 stars!\n\nThe food was great; we ate in the bar for late night snacks (possibly the best oysters I've ever had, so fresh) and for breakfast (the homemade sausage patties ROCKED). Again with the flawless service. We were delighted by the fun small talk we made with friendly bartenders before going out for our night on the town. In retrospect, we should have just hung out in the bar at the hotel all night. We give the food and bar 4 stars!\n\nOverall, our experience was a solid 4 stars! We will definitely back back, and we wish the new owners and management all the best."""""""
4	I'm liking the breakfast bowls - you get a couple of eggs scrambled with your choice of up to six toppings - served over potatoes. I've gone the breakfast burrito route but I prefer the bowl. My potatoes were pretty greasy on my first visit, which was apparently their first day of business, but things have improved. BTW, you get your breakfast bowl with potatoes and Texas toast for only $6.\n\nNo doubt a big part of the appeal is the staff. The atmosphere is mas-o-menos and it's crowded with tables and junk, but the people who work there are great. Very fun, and they toss trivia questions out to patrons all morning on Saturdays.\n\nUm, the bread pudding if AMAZING...\n\nI'm excited to try their corn dog on a stick - without having to hang around a bunch of toothless county fair carnies to get it. Doh! \n\nAnd, I love love love the pomegranate lemonade. \n\nP.S. check your attitude at the door, sit down, relax and enjoy your food.
4	We stayed here on a recent trip to Mesa. The neighborhood is old and somewhat questionable, however the hotel is a gem. Ruben greeted us at the front desk and I liked him instantly. He obviously takes pride in his job and the hotel. The interior is nice and the rooms are recently remodeled. The bed was comfy and the room was clean..even the bathroom (which doesn't happen often in my opinion). \n\nWe stayed three nights and all was great. They offer breakfast (basic bagels, waffle fruit etc) and had a pool and probably the biggest hot tub I've seen at a hotel. The pool was refreshingly cool on a hot day and very clean. The hot tub was at the right temprature for me, but my husband said it could be warmer.\n\nIn all I recommend this place.
3	It's Hooters guys... shouldn't expect too much here.\n\nI will say they are somewhat expensive but recently they had all you can eat wings and another special of boneless wing basket on Wed nights and a few friends and me went there every week for that deal with a couple pitchers... but the beer is even pricey.\n\nI do love their boneless wings and their buffalo chicken sandwiches, pickle and tater salad are a good combo.  I don't go super hot but they have a good range of heat and some honey hots and other good stuff - I say mix it up a bit and try em all out.\n\nThe scene is the same though I will say this location has some talent as of late.  You also have the sports know-it-all who got cut his freshman year and never let it go, the affliction wearing douchebag that's never rolled on a mat in his life, and the fat sloppy guy that takes all the pictures with the girls.   Don't get me wrong, there are others in there but just typical those dudes are in there. \n\nThe girls are super nice... obviously.  But they're not gonna date you big guy - just sayin\n\nAlso, as far as I know they do provide the UFC fights for free so it's an okay backup if you don't have anywhere else to watch it.\n\nI don't eat there a lot but it's not bad when I do :)
5	Doesn't look like much from the outside, but serves up awesome food.\n\nOn a recommendation from DarrenC, I tried this place.  I drove right past it on my first pass, totally didn't even notice the little stand-alone building sitting back from Broadway in the ghetto.  They have burgers, BBQ, Catfish, sandwiches, etc.  The owner is, apparently, a preacher and likes to blast emotional, uplifting gospel-type music which, surprisingly, adds to the enjoyment of the place, and I am not a fan of church or religion.\n\nOh, and the best part.... they serve up sweet tea.  If you work around here, just try it, you will be adding it to your rotation, guaranteed.
4	"""My husband and I came here after hiking Camelback Mountain. We were hungry and wanted some hearty diner food and totally found it in Joe's.\n\nTwo eggs poached for me. Perfect, especially for $0.99. My husband had the corned beef hash covered in two fried eggs with a side of chorizo gravy and biscuts. The hash was as he puts it so well: \Tastes like it's out of a can, just like I like it.\"""" The eggs were cooked well. The only negative was the biscuit. Like good southerners, we're a little picky and it was a little doughy for our taste. But the chorizo gravy is a must. Delicious, and I know my gravy.\n\nThe service is friendly, quick, and attentive. We'd definitely come back next time we're in the area."""""""
3	Decent hotel spot, but nothing more than that. Could use some upgrade attention. 2.6 stars\n\nCost to worth it rating: 3 (got a package with a flight on expedia)\n\nHighlights:\n- Location: right downtown by the ballpark and a few restaurants\n- Bars and restaurants on premise: they are just ok but at least available if you want something easy\n- Southwestern benedict: delicious concoction with poached egg, guacamole, fried tomato, on top of a biscuit and covered in a chili hollandaise. A classic gone spicy--loved it! We had it on the 2nd floor cafe, but you can get it for room service as well.\n- Comfy bed     \n- Glass elevator: kinda fun especially for kids\n- Flight check I'm computer: at the front desk so you can print out your boarding passes\n\nMidlights:\n- Random sculpture art: acrobatic bunnies and small headed big men and such all around \n\nLowlights:\n- Pool: small and weak, only 3 ft within the entire thing, area surrounding pool not very pleasant. Also drink menus on each table but no drink service--kind of odd.\n- Business center: only for people on the 7th floor\n- Wireless: available but fee per 24 hrs\n- Outdated look to the place \n- Not sure if it was just cause of the music conference, but the hotel as a whole smelled like pot\n \nNot much to say about it but it was where our friends were staying. Next visit, I'll probably stay elsewhere.
2	As an ACTUAL native New Yorker, this place is a real disappointment. Breaded wings? Ranch with the wings (not offered the choice)? Blue cheese from a jar with no chunks and that xanthum gum shine on top? The owners might have once been from Buffalo, but boy have they pulled up those roots. \n\nI will say the wing sauces and pizza were decent and the restaurant was clean. The manager however took the time to explain his Sinus infection to guests in the rest room...really dude? Come on!\n\nIf I was in a group and everyone wanted to go...I would. I might however bring my own Blue Cheese.
1	"""Small burger, Small fry, Small drink = $10\n\nBurger -- Tomato and Lettuce were fresh and good.  Bun \collapsed\"""" and became that gooey fake white bread bun that you can see where your hand grabbed the burger.  The patty/cheese was fine, I guess...but I didn't get any real flavor from it.\n\nFries -- They use \""""real\"""" potatoes, but the fries are flavorless.  But at least they're greasy!\n\nSoda -- Kudos for a good selection, including two diet-caffeine-free choices, something I've never seen before!\n\nI'm not a fanboy of In-n-Out, but at least they know to charge a reasonable price for their food (which is much better than Five Guys).\n\nIn summary...this place is the emperor with no clothes.  And they want you to know that lots of newspapers around the country think they're great...the reviews are all over the walls.  Perhaps they're trying to convince patrons that their tastebuds and pocketbook are lying..."""""""
4	In Short: Good food and beer at a reasonable price, and a quirky atmosphere.\n\nI've been there several times in the past year, and I must profess that peering into the place for the very first time, I was quite skeptical.  Restaurant has a an interesting design, reminiscent of a large hall way.  Once you walk in there's a bar to the left and booths to the right and the place had a friendly neighborhood vibe to it.\n\nThe menu is decent with a variety old old world and new pasties.  The staff was friendly and order taking was prompt.  Although it did take longer than anticipated to actually get food, but I imagine that's because they don't have things pre-made.  The food was quite flavorful and the proportions were adequate.  The stuffing was moist and the outside crust was just the right amount of crispiness.  I usually try out the pasty's with lamb and none have disappointed me so far.\n\nOverall, a great place to have beer and pasties, I will visit again to try out their more curious concoctions.
4	I love FIlmBar. I only wish I would have opened such a gem in my city. This theatre isn't your typical red vines and popcorn type of place. They serve beer, wine and have a cool lounge area to sip your cocktails before and after movies. The showtimes and movies are limited and they change things up often so check them out online to see a full schedule of what is playing and when. \nCheers to you FilmBar - can't wait to visit again soon!
4	Pita Jungle = wholesome love.\n\nI'm a big fan and lover of Pita Jungle and have frequented the original Tempe location numerous times ever since hs back in 98 and have enjoyed many chicken shwarmas and hummus plates BUT the Chandler location rocks! I just love their space in the Anderson Springs Plaza, it's airy, love the art, the lighting, the staff and the overall feel. Atmosphere aside, like the Pita in tempe and the Jungle in Mesa at Dobson and Southern, the food is just awesome. I believe this is the location that I fell in love with my all time favorite item on the menu and that is the chicken pasta salad, a concoction of Marinated grilled chicken breast tossed with rotini pasta, fresh tomatoes, with lemon vinaigrette. Eversince first bite, I have been enamored by this simple pasta salad, the lemon vinaigrette is simply delicious intermixed with the pasta, I usually ask for extra tomatoes coz i love my lycopene. And I tend to order it often, I must remind you all that I'm not a fan of the norm but this dish does it to me. Anywho, tonight, I tried something new, after being reassured by my friend Dani that it's alright to live life on the edge, so, i got myself the Philly Steak Pita. YUM, liked it not loved it but I'll order it again in the future. BUT i still love my chicken pasta salad.
5	When i first move to an area i have a checklist...grocery store, hole in the wall bar, a couple great restaurants...one of which much be chinese.\n\ni was not let down by Golden Gate. Its a small dark ambiance which i love. The staff is courteous and by now know me when i place my order or walk in with new recruits. \n\nalmost as if routine i order the usual sweet and sour pork *light delicious sauce with generous vegetables* crab angels, chow mein and fried rice. i love all of it. then just when you think you're finished, here comes the fried banana for dessert. unbelievable.\n\nevery time i recommend this place to my friends, they take a look at the plain exterior and give me the sideways look. the if something goes down im throwing you directly in front of me as a human shield look. then they sink their teeth into their first bite of food. \n\nthey they too become golden gate addicts. in a couple words? i HIGHLY recommend.
5	Outstanding food, top notch menu.  And if you get there for happy hour you'll get $5 drinks and $9 Big Ass burgers.  The patio is lovely but you need to get there by 4:30 to get a seat.  It's first come, first served.\n\nYou can order from the dinner menu starting at 5PM.  The salmon is delicious, as is the bacon-wrapped pork.\n\nA delightful dining experience. If you aren't going for happy hour, be sure to make a reservation a few days in advance - it books quickly.
3	This is an okay place to shop. It is a little walmartish feeling and a bit messy, but you can find some great designer clothing here at great prices... for example I tried on a pair of $675.00 Gucci pants marked down to $165.00 but they did have a barely noticeable stain on them. I got a great B. Makowsky bag for $75 smackers! \n\nI would not do serious shopping here to try and piece an outfit together, but I would come back to see if I can grab a sweet deal on a premier designer piece.\n\nPretty good selection and sizes, friendly staff and no waiting in line and it was a Saturday afternoon.
2	The places I hate most in this world are those that can't figure out what they want to be.  Coach and Willies is the epitome of this syndrome.\n\nWe came here for a meal, some drinks and to watch March Madness.  Boy what a mistake.  Being near the stadiums, I figured this place for a low rent, liquor up before the game place.  I should have done my research. This place desperately wants to upscale.  From the prices to the menu, it screams 'Look! Aren't we above the fray?' Well you know what, places above the fray don't have 87 TVs tuned to sports.  They also don't have a waitstaff that approaches you with a 'What's up yo?'  They also don't have facial tattoos.\n\nBut I was alright with delineation of style initially as the pizzas were half off.  But of course they were doughy and meh.  Well at least the games were on and the audio was being pumped in through the bar's speakers.  Oh wait, at 7 they turned down the lights and changed to some crappy R+B radio station. I guess that crowd who was coming in to get their 5 course wine and food pairings didn't want to listen to the game.  Why exactly they came to Coach and Willies then, I'll never know.
5	After lots of online research and dealing with stupid dealerships, sorry Van Tuyl, but you are finally out of my life for good!!! My hubby and I were checking out a Subaru Outback trading in a Toyota FJ Cruiser  for lack of space and terrible way, (sometimes laughable) to get in to the back seat! An Outback is sure more practical and a bit more economical. A couple of friends have one and they simply love it. They referred us to Ron at Power Subaru of Scottsdale. I myself think I rather be at the dentist than dealing with a car salesman! Well, Ron has completely turned me 360 degrees on that statement! Ron by far not a typical car salesperson, on the contrary, he treated us like family. We could ask anything and he would answer it! We test drove a few Outbacks and found ours. It was a stormy night, which made this adventure much more enjoyable! I have never ever have had FUN purchasing a car until Ron! Ohh and I cannot leave out his manager, Moose! He too made it a great experience. I am certain that Subaru will be part of our family for quite some time if not forever! Thank you to Ron, Moose, and the entire team that stormy night at Power Subaru. It was a pleasure to purchase our 1st Subaru with you!!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!!
4	Never had a bad meal at any Thai Basil, but especially this one on the corner of Rural and Chandler. I usually do take-out, but I have eaten in as well. The take-out experience has always been quick & easy - my order has always been waiting for me when I walked in. Nice, quiet dining in experience - soft music, some cool asian stuff to look at. Not usually very crowded - only real traffic seems to be the steady stream of people coming in to pick up to go orders. The curry dishes are delicious, and served in generous portions (especially when ordered for take-out). Courteous service & quality food. The spice factor seems a little inconsistent. They ask you how spicy you want it - I tell them the same thing every time, and sometimes it's really spicy and sometimes not so much.\n\nMy only real complaint - the hours. They close everyday between lunch and dinner from 4-5pm, which somehow always seems to be when the craving strikes. And they're closed on Sundays.
4	Great service, good food, so-so preparedness. I came for the Yelp Eats promotion, but one of the more popular items on the menu (scallops) had sold out. Usually, his would not be a problem, but I had already sold myself on the side item for this entree -- corn grits! And needless to say, this southern influenced girl was sorely disappointed not to get my serving of grits :( but no fear, the waitress made sure I got my corn grits on the side.  The rest of their entree items looked fair, but nothing in particular stood out as a must have.  I settled on a halibut dish.  The appetizers list looked a bit more interesting... \n\nThe good:\n- The chopped salad is a must try (this appetizer has it's own Facebook page for crying out loud!)\n- The staff.  We were quickly greeted and sat at our table upon arrival, and our drink orders were taken and delivered to the table in record time.  Throughout our meal, my husband harassed the waitress for different selections of wine -- but she was a good sport. He is forever embarrassing me in public, so any spot that can put up with his drunken shenanigans is a win.\n\nThe not as good:\n- Best looking dish, scallops, was not available\n- My halibut was overcooked\n- We came in on a Sunday, and the place was half empty... But food still took long time to get cooked. I didn't mind this much, as I was not in a hurry. But if I had been on a schedule, this would surely been annoying\n- No cappuccino since machine was broken (boo)\n\nOverall, i'd give this place a 3.5.  The chopped salad and friendly service was enough to make me overlook some of their lesser qualities.  I'd like to go back another time and see whether my experience is different--maybe I just caught them on an off night?
2	"""I stopped by here on Saturday during the day to scope out the menu. Was 100% empty at 3:30. I sampled (yeah that's right.. i cheated! hardly ever happens) one of their tortillas and was hooked. Small kitchen in the back staffed by some nice Mexican ladies.. Smelled great.. total dive type place. It had success written all over it.\n\nThree of us pull up at 7pm ready to stuff our faces. The parking lot is packed which has to be a good sign. Walk in and are confused. Do we ordered at the window? Sit down and wait? wait to be seated? After about 5 minutes I flag a lady down and ask. She asked if it was take away, I let her know if was to stay she told us to take a seat and she would be with us shortly.\n\nAfter viewing the reviews/pictures the first thing I ordered were the chips and a cheese crisp with guacamole. The chips and salsa and water hit our table right away and the CC zoomed out less than 5 minutes later. Sadly this is where the speediness stopped :(\n\nAnytime we needed something after that point we had to flag someone down and ask.. sometimes twice. Its not that they were lazy its that their were only two of them serving a really busy restaurant. This is no fault of theirs but a fault of management. Staff your establishments accordingly! A Saturday night rush cannot possibly be \news\"""" to this place. It was obvious this was the norm.\n\nWith empty drinks/chips we watched and waited as food slowly trickled from the kitchen. 45 minutes and our food finally showed up. It was fresh so we had not been forgotten about. They were THAT busy for the size of the kitchen. Another ding for the restaurant management.\n\nannnyywayys.. I believe I can separate my feelings on management/service/food so onto the food :)\n\nchips hot/mild salsa:\nSuper tasty! The chips had a very pleasant corn flavor, fresh, and far from greasy. On first glance I was sure I was going to hate the regular salsa. I'm one of those weirdo's that likes tomatoes everyway but fresh and it was loaded. I tasted it and prepared for the cringe.. NONE! it was really good. Not sure what they did to remove whatever it is about the fresh tomatoes i hate but they did it. The \""""hot\"""" sauce in the bottle was also very good, standard chili, garlic, Mexican oregano that you find at most places. All three of them were addictive and I was almost happy we never requested a refill.\n\ncheese crisp:\nDelicious Tortilla (check), Super Sexy Cheese Blend (Check), Crispy (Check), Foldability (MASSIVE FAIL). DOH! If you read my review on la pi\u00f1ata you will see me talk about this. This happens when you try and slightly fold and overly crispy cheese crisp to maximize guac/salsa capacity. Snap! you try and recover SNAP! Now your hands are covered with grease and salsa and you have this crazy folded discombobulated mess on your plate(see attached picture.) I have to believe you all know what I'm talking about. Still tasty.\n\nguacamole:\nThey at least have the \""""avocado is the star\"""" aspect of this down but it was lackluster. There are some supporting ingredients that really help bring out the creaminess/fat flavor of the avocado. It lacked citrus, salt, flavor in general. At least it wasn't 3/4 tomato :)\n\nshredded beef taco:\nIt was decent but nothing amazing. They weren't stuffed and then fried which I believe makes a superior taco. Something was overly wet as after two bites it fell victim to taco shell failure. Bottom falls out and you ended up finishing it with a fork. The meat could have definitely used more seasoning.\n\nground beef taco:\nOnly difference here was ground beef and had much more seasoning. Standard large amount of chili powder/cumin.\n\ngreen corn chicken tamale:\nWOW!! The comments about these are dead on. Really good even nekkid. Moist with just the right sweetness and corn flavor. I could have had a plate full of these and probably wanted more.\n\nchile relleno:\nThe pepper was bland, the cheese was a little scarce but at least melted and warm. You can tell the batter was at one point fluffy and light but in a short time ended up a soggy mess. Covered in green sauce.\n\ncheese enchilada:\nAmazing cheese with a small spin of adding onion which I liked the combo. This was covered on red sauce.\n\nSauce:\nRed: Above average, nice fat content and good roasted pepper flavor.\nGreen: No real heat, spice, or even chile flavor. I was disappointed because a few people mentioning how amazing it was.\n\nPros:\nCheese\nTamales\nChips/Salsa\nReasonably Priced\n\nCons:\nHorrible Service: Due to understaffing\nBland: This isn't uncommon for Senoran style but this was excessive.\n\nSummary:\nWhen I have a craving for tamales and delicious tortillas I will be back. Anything else I will likely head elsewhere. If there is something amazing there that I absolutely have to try please let me know! So out of 10 items the group really only liked 2 with a possible 3rd. Maybe it was an off night but I can't give this more then a 2.5 based on our experience. I really wanted to love this place :("""""""
4	It's dirty... it's loud... it's noisy... the drinks are massive... it has a mechanical bull where people can make complete fools of themselves after drinking too much... and it's jam packed with people.\n\nI love it. :-D\n\nI don't often go out to bars like these these days... I've kinda grown out of it, but every now and then I get an urge to just get out there and have a total sensory overload and now that I've been here... this is where I'll go next time. :)
3	Solid three stars.. i was not able to try the hummus on this trip since that would have been the determining factor if this place would get a fourth star or not.\n\nThree stars for the food we did have, price, and portions were good as well. My friend had the feta gyro and thoroughly enjoyed it. i had a turkey/cheese pita it was good could only eat half..it was a lot of food. You get a choice of fries, salad, fresh fruit and a potato salad i believe. we both had the fresh fruit and it was very good. Nice assortment as well. Just not one measly grape and a crapload of cantaloupe..had strawberries, mango..the whole shebang.\n\nThe spanakopita was just alright :/\n\nglad there is Greek food spot close to my job since it is not that common in this area, def not bad and i  will be back to try it again.. there's some potential.
3	I've been to Brio several times (all lunch) and it's a decent spot.  Through architectural trickery, somehow all the restaurants at the Scottsdale Quarter are made to appear very small from the outside yet lo and behold are cavernous upon entry!\n\nI had the Mediterranean Chicken Salad (my diet attempt for upcoming Hawaii trip) and it was ok.  Unexciting.  I've also had the flatbreads here and I believe pasta once....but it's just not memorable.\n\nService has always been good, and the lunch specials very reasonable.  The best bread item (seasoned crisps) were stale this time--no bueno.\n\nI can't get excited about Brio, it's food, and faux Tuscan architecture but I can't really knock it.  Oh, and the bathroom really smelled like a bathroom--not cleansers but um...urine.  Seal that travertine folks!
2	Damnit Scratch.  I wanted to like you.  I really did.  \n\nOverall:\nHere's the deal:  My daughter and I do 'daddy/daughter' once a month or so.  We decided to go see a movie and then hit this place for lunch on Saturday.  I'm sure this place is doing something right (or perhaps Yelp is doing something right on their behalf?) because this place was hopping.  As in: packed.  As in:  no seats available.  \n\nSo we decide to do takeout.  We ordered 2 sandwiches (they each come with side salad greens) and 2 desserts.  And we waited outside on their patio set for our order to be done.\n\nLocation:  \nVERY hard to spot for a few reasons:  \na.) It's in a strip mall\nb.) The signage is HIDDEN BY A SUN-SHADE.\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, It's nestled between a Subway and some other insignificant strip-mall business. Look for the subway if you're trying to find it.\n\nAmbiance\nCute in a neo-french sort of way.  Pastry case where you order, small indoor seating area and communal table, and a bit of outdoor seating that's probably only comfortable to use about 2 months out of the year here in Arizona.  (Did you know that it got uncomfortably hot outside here in Arizona?  Who knew?)  Campy french music playing when we were there.\n\nMenu selection\nHere's where it gets really interesting.  Their pastries look delicious.  To be honest, it was hard to pick just a few things to try.  Their sandwiches sound incredible, and these were hard to choose as well.  I settled on a Croque Monsieur and an almond tart.  The part that is heartbreaking for a first-timer here is possibly spending a small fortune on something that isn't at all what you expected.  \n\nPrice\nHere's my main sticking point with Scratch Pastries.  This place is EXTREMELY expensive for what you get.  Our sandwiches were above average in both uniqueness and quality, but not 200% better than subway, next door (and that's about what we paid).  The pastries were the main event, both in presentation & price.  Again:  They were good, but not $5+ good (and that's what we paid for them.  Per pastry)\n\nSummary:\nPretty cute.  Very francophile.  Interesting menu.  Very expensive.  Probably won't be back for a while.
3	Came mid-day for drinks and apps after a hike in Papago Park. Got Irish nachos and was very pleased with them -- potatoes cut up like slightly thick chips and not just served as french fries like many Irish-like bars. \n\nOur server was quite nice and brought out samples of different brews so we wouldn't feel stuck with something we might not like while trying something new. We didn't ask her to, she just did it. That was pretty cool. \n\nWhile I do agree that the uniforms are somewhat cheesy, I think it's silly that people are complaining about them. The girls chose to work there, just as you chose to eat there. If you don't like it stay away from Hooters, Heart Attack Grill, the Grill Next Door and Tilted Kilt.\n\nNow I was a bit irked by the price, however. Irish nachos and two pints came out to $19. Jebus.
5	Bicycle Haus is the best shop in the Valley, if not State. It's as simple as that. There isn't another shop that carries the selection (and if you don't see what you are looking for, ask), has the friendly, and actually knowledgeable staff, and reputation that Haus does. This place has a selection like I've never seen before, especially if you are looking for high end product. The inventory and shop is always rotating and fresh, so I like to stop in and see what's new almost weekly, plus the staff is really friendly, and always willing to talk bikes. They have a great selection of apparel, accessories, and nutrition, in brands that you can't find anywhere else around. \n\nIf you have never been fit on a bike before, this is the place to do it. It is literally a computer science, the two hour long (give or take) session, will customize your machine to you! Taking into account your body, flexibility, physical limitation, goals, and what type of riding you are doing to put you into the most comfortable, efficient, and effective position possible! \n\nThe shop also does a lot to support the cycling community both in Charity and time and effort. \n\nBottom line, if you are looking for good quality and service, this is the place.
4	Tonight I ate in the dining room of Modern Steak and got another taste of the delicious menu offerings. For the feast we started with a chopped salad, grilled artichoke and roasted winter squash. Each item was delicious and a great way to get our taste buds warmed up for the meal. At first I was hesitant to try the squash since I'm typically not a huge squash fan, but one bite and I lost all former memories! The squash melted in my mouth and was seasoned with a butter and cinnamon spread. I probably could have eaten the entire dish and been satisfied, but on to entrees we went! \n\nWhile my willpower fought between the salmon and burger, I decided to let the salmon part win that night (even though the burger looked so good). The salmon was bacon glazed and placed upon round sweet potatoes. The portion was huge but I found a way to consume half of it which was plenty for me! I did manage to eat all of the sweet potatoes though which were too good to pass up! \n\nThe waiter was friendly and kept the meal flowing. Bravo Modern Steak!
5	Small and hard to find first time there.  Aside from that great ambiance.  Small place with a very personal feel.  The menu has a lot of great options, but you can not miss the smoked turkey/ duck rellenos.  They are filled with amazing meat, topped with your cheese and you choice of red or green chili, every time i think about rellenos this is the first thing that pops into my head.  Service is great sometimes and fair others, but with food this good it easily makes up for it.  If you go for breakfast get a bloody mary, they serve it the traditional way with a beer back.
3	Bless me Yelp for I have sinned. \nIt has been two and a half months since my last review.\n\nTo be honest, I haven't really been going anywhere. However, I did make it to CR last week and decided to come talk about it.\n\nI had been here a few times prior, but it was always on the weekend in the evening. At this time, this place pretty much sucks - that is unless you like to wait in line, hang around with the type of people that would party at a country/rock nightclub located in a strip mall, deal with bad service, and have no place to sit. If that's your bag, then go here and fill it up.\n\nThe other day, I was there on a weeknight right around 7pm. I even stayed for a few hours and ordered food and drink with someone. We don't have a great idea of what the food is like because we only had salads. My Caesar was merely okay. I would eat it again. The other salad was reportedly good. Our drinks were pretty awful though. Margaritas made with cheap liquor... gave us both headaches. They also didn't taste very good. \n\nOn the other hand, their menu had many greasy deep fried things or meaty beef things that sounded like they might be good. The service was good - but that's got to have everything to do with the fact that the place was pretty empty. That didn't stop them from playing Mtv from the 80s - from Bon Jovi to Billy Idol. \n\nThis place also had a bull that I suppose could be ridden by drunk college kids. It wasn't operational while we were there, but I can't imagine it being as entertaining as Saddle Ranch. Having been to the one in LA and the one in Phoenix, I can say that few places can really top or rival the tragic humor that is watching Saddle Ranch bull riding.\n\nBasically, Cadillac Ranch is a generic strip-mall restaurant/bar that has decent service (when it's slow) and edible food. This place has a theme that's a combination of a few different things - none of which accomplished to any sort of accuracy. It's just really average.
4	According to a friend of mines whom is from the motherland - China.  The food here is pretty authentic.  I will have to take her word for it and go from there.  She ordered us some basic Szechwan style dishes, which I think she took it I didn't want to go too exotic.  --- I do actually I do ---  However, there's always next time!  Pigs ear, beef tendon, duck whatever!  Please I don't mind :)  For what we ordered, I thought it was pretty good.  I tell you what though, won't ever come without my friend since she knows how to order.  I'd probably order like a gwy-lo ---  hehe.  Our server was on top of it, but I gather it's because we spoke the language -- Plus 1!  The ambience was pretty basic, but with a bunch of mandarin speaking people eating and chatting away - felt like China after all haha!  - Enjoy!
4	This Whole Foods is large, roomy and has all the kewl stuff that I cannot afford. Maybe an organic apple...but that's about it! \n\nHa.ha... I typically go to Whole Foods Market for Homeopathic medicine and to pick up some essential oils. This place is a little out of my way so I end up here every two months. Last time I swung by, there was a very helpful gentleman in the apothecary department. He took the time to take me around the store as I blurted out different things I needed/wanted. You know, I like the kind of service where they look you in the eye when you speak to them and don't get a smirk started when you ask for the grapefruit seed extract etc.\n\nAnyways, when you enter this Whole Foods, be prepared for an amazing smell of all the fresh fruit they have laid out for you to peruse. Nothing like the sterile smell when you walk into a Fry's or other large grocery stores. The apples smell good even when you get them home and I have been trying to get hubs to eat an apple at his lunch for five years and even though he doesn't know where the apples come from, he always, always eats the ones from Whole Foods. They just give off this true apple-e smell. I think I am going back to WF today for the apples. \n\nLike their return policy. The receipt says that you can bring back most things with a receipt.
5	I do not have to even think twice when I say that Rock-n-Roll Chicken Fingers is one of the best places to eat in the Tempe area.  Ever since the first time I ate there a few years ago, I have always had an amazing experience.\n\nFirst off, every meal is cooked with care, and is treated as though it is the most important plate there.  Nothing is slopped together like your average fast food joint.  The service is far from average as well.  \n\nThe owner of the restaurant is always friendly with every customer that walks in.  I always feel welcome and important when I come in.  \n\nIt may not be the biggest food chain around, or filled with several employees, but nonetheless, the food always makes my mouth water, and the owner cares about me as a customer.  This is how every restaurant should be, and I commend them for their hard work.  I will continue to eat here, as well as refer all of my friends to eat there.  \n\nPlease join the Rock -n-Roll Chicken Fingers family like I have!!
4	Nice little bar located in a outdoor mall like complex downtown. We were in town for a softball tournament and stayed at the Hilton, so this bar was just a few minute walk away. Nice.  Stopped in there about 3 times during our weekend stay just to grab drinks when we had a spare few minutes.  Bartenders were friendly and quick to serve.  Drinks were on the strong side. NICE!  It had a fun little patio...but unfortunately we were in Phoenix during some weird cold/rainy weather so it wasn't as enjoyable as it should have been.  Overall Kobalt is a nice little hangout bar....which is just my type of bar :o)
2	"""The only thing I will ever remember about this place is the icy customer service and the inflexible menu. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito since I'm a substitute kind of person and on the menu is said \absolutely NO substitutes!\"""" - yikes! So instead of getting $9 out of me they only got $6. But lets talk about this bean and cheese burrito...I was under the impression that a bean and cheese burrito was basically - bean and cheese wrapped up in a warm tortilla and maybe some graded cheese on top. \n\nWell, this was not the case! Half way through my burrito I came across shredded beef pieces! I'm not a vegetarian, but if I was I would have had a heart attack! The first thing that came to my mind was \""""absolutely NO substitutes!\"""" - but does that mean only they can substitute? Or is the cook just going senile? Either way, I didn't like that. Not one bit. I didn't really even want the bean and cheese burrito, I really wanted the taco salad, but I couldn't ask for substitutes so I was forced to pick the plainest thing on the menu and they go and add stuff to it! \n\nI did like that they left the water pitcher with us at the table...however, the table they gave us was the smallest table in the room. We barely had room for our plates and utensils, let-alone this big water jug. I felt cramped; and this was emphasized by the guy sitting behind me, because when he scooted his chair back a little bit - it nearly knocked me face first into my plate! Oh, and by the way, large groups: they \""""absolutely will NOT split checks\"""" so this is not the best place to go Dutch. \n\nI will end on a positive note: ....did I mention already that they left water for us to refill our glasses? Oh...I did. Well, I guess I ran out of positives - Sorry."""""""
3	Panchero's is a nice place to stop in for a quick burrito or quesadilla. It doesn't measure up Qdoba in my book, but it delivers a solid, fast meal. I have been to this location a few times and the service has been good.\n\nI like the quesadillas best, but the burrito bowl and burritos are good, too. The hot salsa has a nice flavor and may be worth getting a side order of chips with. The ingredients are not always the freshest, so I end up picking certain things out, such as fatty parts of the meat and jalapeno tips. Overall, the food has satisfactory quality and flavors. \n\nMost people stick to steak and chicken, but I really recommend trying the carnitas and barbecoa for a more exciting meal. I find these meats to have much stronger, spicier flavors.
4	In town for business for a few days, I dined here twice with a group each time. Once for lunch, once for dinner. Good experiences both times, although the food was a little mixed. \n\nFor lunch, I went with the German Kobe Beef Burger. It was large, but didn't have a of flavor. There was about a tablespoon of sauerkraut on it as well, which (taste-wise) was about on par with the rest of the burger. Okay, but not a lot of flavor. \n\nDisclaimer: Please take my criticisms of any German cuisine with a grain of salt. I lived there for 11 years and the Germans spoiled me with their cooking. It's not entirely fair for me to compare authentic German food prepared by Germans with our best American shot at the same. Unless they hired a German cook. In which case he should be ashamed of himself...\n\nOkay with that out of the way, let's move on to dinner the following evening, shall we? \n\nI went with the server's recommendation again (I'm doing this a lot lately). She recommended the fish tacos so I went with them. \n\nThey were truly outstanding!!!! The absolute best tacos I've had, hands down. I'm not exaggerating, they were really that good. And they even come out on these cool little metal stands that keep your taco upright until you're ready to pick it up and have at it. Pretty nice. \n\nThey also came with a side of white rice covered in black beans. Also very good. \n\nAnd on both occasions the service was impeccable. There's a large dining area and a bar too if you prefer to dine solo like that. Or with a group. It's really up to you. \n\nAnd there's outdoor seating, too. \n\nAll in all, I've been a big fan of Gordon Biersch restaurants everywhere I've gone in the country. And Tempe, AZ, keeps the tradition alive.
4	Before coming to BYPV, I had heard some good things and some not very good things too.  However, after taking classes for three times, I was really beginning to like this studio.   The teachers were all different in their own ways and they never failed to welcome everyone who came in and they knew everyone too!!!  They had a good system going, the teacher would sit by the front desk, watch a student sign in and made a point of remembering that student.  This works especially during class when the teacher would call the student by name and correct their poses.  I learned so much and improved so much in my poses since the teachers would always try to make me do my best at each pose, making me believe that I can do better.  This studio also seemed popular as their classes were always full, no more than 6 inches between mats!  It can be good or bad once again but the energy is totally positive. The only drawback was the bathroom which is too small but everyone is always mindful & respectful of one another.  Just remember to come always fully hydrated and be prepared to sweat...
3	Ate the eggs bennedict which was alright. A little too salty and a little too much hollandaise sauce for my taste. The potatoes sauteed with onions on the other hand did a fine job satisfying my taste buds!\n\nalso ordered an iced americano which wasn't too bold or light. \nStaff are really friendly. Always talking with the biggest smile and willing to open doors for you when you exit. \n\nthe place is neat and modernized. Sort of in between a diner and ikea\n\nhappy hour from 3-7 pm. Have to check that out some day...probably not any time soon though
2	Had a yogurt parfait, and a diet coke - something that almost every stand in any airport has available - nationwide.\n\nI WAS going to get the chicken salad - but I just glanced at the nutritional information. Holy shit, nearly 900 calories and 78% of the daily fat intake.. in a salad? How do they even do that? Do they drizzle it in pig lard and spray it with butter? Good lord. So, if you're looking for some generic yogurt.. I'd say go for it, but man - do not get a salad if you want to live.
5	I LOVE THIS THEATER!\n\nIt's usually not that busy (we went on New Year's Day so it was a bit more busy than usual), but still beats other locations that are overrun with attitude filled teenagers!  It's also kept very clean!\n\nOutdoor ticket kiosks are great so you can avoid the indecisiveness of some patrons.  Push a few buttons, slide your card, grab your ticket and go!  \n\nThey had PLENTY of lines open at concession and were filling orders very quickly and with a smile on their faces.  \n\nPopcorn is the bomb and of course they have FREE seasonings! Yes...FREE!  \n\nThe only thing I will say is starting this year...loyalty cup refills are now going to be $1.50 as opposed to $1.  It's okay...better than paying $4.00 a visit!  I love how the staff is always waiting to clean the theater as soon as the movie is over and they thank you for coming and are just happy and seem to really like their jobs!\n\nThanks Harkins for always making movie going experience enjoyable and problem free!
3	For $100 I think I'd rather go to Mastro's or another steakhouse. \nService here was excellent and you definitely get a wide variety of meat options, but I only found two out of the 6+ choices tasty. The lamb leg and the bacon wrapped filet were delicious but the sausages, pork, chicken, pork/beef ribs and even filet mignon were unimpressive. \nThe salad bar a $22.50 upcharge wasn't exactly worth the price. Nothing stood out, and there wasn't anything amazing that I went back for seconds for. \nSides were complimentary, which included fried polenta, mashed potatoes, and fried bananas. They were pretty good, but don't compare to the lobster mash or truffle mac and cheese as Mastro's. \nThe ambience is definitely nice and upscale without being stuffy. Plenty of kids running around and guys with backwards facing hats on. This was my first legitimate Brazilian steakhouse experience and I think it will be my last. If  you're looking for variety go to KBBQ and you'll also leave feeling overstuffed, satisfied, and still have an extra $50 in your wallet.
4	Since I had a lovely night here last night and have had several such nights, it must be time for me to yelp this place.\n\nI wouldn't say that I would go to Side Bar on any random night, but rather on a night where I felt like doing it up just a little bit.  I'm not a lounge bar girl, but rather a dive bar girl.  Either way, as far as lounge bars go, Side Bar is basically it.  This is the kind of bar you bring a boy that you're dating who lives in Tempe to show him that there are cool bars in Central PHX.  It seemed to work out well for me last night.\n\nThe crowd can be pretty hit or miss- I've seen some major characters in this place.  You just have to lay back and take it all in, I guess.  \n\nI'm always a bit irritated by the lack of draft beer, but Strongbow always seems to make me happy here.  The bartenders are hot, and they have mints in the bathroom.  I'm a fan.
2	We've tried this place several times in the past few years, and each time that we do, I end up kicking myself for giving it another shot.  I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.\n\nI find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade.
4	We went there on a hot Tuesday afternoon. It turns out that they are in the same parking lot as Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket and since I go to Lee Lees a lot, we decided to swing by Gelato 64 as well. The cashier came out from the kitchen/prep area to help us. They have a bunch of sorbets, and of course gelato. I tried the Chocolate Turtle and the Ferrero Rocher flavors. I was not disappointed. \n\nBut, there was something missing. The gelato wasn't out of this world or anything and they sure could do more in regards to making their desserts more appealing visually. It looked like that effort was put in making the actual product but not in the presentation. \n\nI am not going to be craaaving to go back or anything. In my opinion, none of the gelato shops in Phoenix compare to Frost in Tucson. Sigh... Now, I would actually drive down to Tucson from Phx for some Frost gelato. Yumm..
5	Wow, incredible experience.  This has been on our wishlist for some time and thanks to Yelp Eats for getting us down there.  Just a wonderful evening.  \n\nStellar ambiance, just the right lighting with a spacious main dining room but felt very cozy much like an old inn.  Loved that the bar is the center of the space because energy emanates from the bar to the tables, creating a real sense of communal dining.  \n\nOur server Gary was dynamite.  He walked us through the menu, focusing on his favorite items, and explaining in detail the ingredients and preparation and he was very influential.  Myself and a friend took his advice and thoroughly enjoyed the scallops, which were perfectly prepared.  My husband ordered the short ribs and he really loved them, especially the dried cherry BBQ sauce.  I was fortunate to steal a bite and they were delectable.  Our other friend loved the pork loin, which was also cooked perfectly.  \n\nWe finished the meal with to-die-for donut holes with three dipping sauces - key lime, blueberry, and caramel-coconut.  So good!!!\n\nCannot say enough about Citizen Public House, and it is a must-have, and a must-return!!
3	"""Went here on a whim because we were in the area and had seen this place in Groupon a couple times.  All in all, we had a decent experience but nothing too great.  If you are expecting extremely attentive service, you might want to look at another place.  The service was spotty at best, but one should not expect much from a breakfast place because after all, you really come to a breakfast \joynt\"""" for the food.  \n\nTheir selection and price for a build your own omelette is really good and they DO NOT charge extra for egg whites only like other breakfast places.  We both tried an egg white omelette and were satisfied with the size; it was rather large and you could tell they didn't skimp on the egg whites.  Their hash browns were normal, not excellent but not the worst either.  Buttermilk pancakes were very good!  I did get a side order of the sausage gravy/biscuits and i was not too impressed.  The gravy was a little too think for my liking.  It was as if they putt too much cream in the gravy and/or let it sit in the pan to let the fluid evaporate from the gravy.  They literally doused the plate with the stuff and it was hard to even figure out where the biscuits were.  Maybe, that's how they make their sausage gravy, but i was not too impressed and took two bites and let it sit there.  I probably would not order that again.  \n\nI would come to this place again.  It is a normal breakfast place with a lot of good choices for breakfast and cheap for the amount of food you get.  I do recommend this place but do not come here if you want to be waited on hand and foot."""""""
5	You might see from my other reviews that I have long thought BoSa has the best donuts in the valley.  Well, I have tried Lamar's, and I think their donuts might be a little better.\n\nThe donuts at Lamar's are fresh and light and tasty.  The reviews indicated the selection is limited late morning,  but at 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday they appeared to have just about everything in stock.  They keep primarily to the standards, for good reason.  They just make really good donuts.\n\nTheir one location in the NW valley isn't as convenient for me as BoSa's two locations, and they might be just a little more expensive.  But I vote their taste and selection just a little better.\n\nSo they get a 5-start rating, the same as BoSa.  If you go to either of these donut shops you won't be disappointed.
3	Service is fortunately better in a bad economy. We had 5 check backs by the staff.\n\nThe food was good, and rice was done correctly. Not parts of it so hard it'll break your teeth from being in the oven too long. \n\nThe margarita had way too much ice, and I felt ripped off for what they cost. Less ice, better value would go farther than all the check-backs. I hate to complain, as do most people when out to dinner. Just do it right the first time....
5	I'm a die-hard Hoodlums fan. I was there in 1998 when they started up, and I'm happy to say that I still can shop there in 2008! \n\nAfter the disastrous ASU Memorial Union fire, I saved up all my CD-buying until Hoodlums relocated from the MU to their current location on the southwest corner of Guadalupe and McClintock in Tempe. \n\nI don't know how they do it, but there is musical magic going on at Hoodlums. The staff there truly know their musical stuff ~ if you are in need of musical advice, they will actually make recommendations based on your tastes. The range of the CDs available is joyfully eclectic. I'm always in the mood for a treasure hunt at Hoodlums to see what new and cool music I can find, and they never fail to have in stock some artist that I have never heard of but that is a worthy addition to my collection.\n\nSo, in summary, go to Hoodlums, enjoy the in-store music, browse for a while, buy a few CDs (I attempt to limit it to 6 or less on each trip!!), and then stop by the Trader Joe's for some wine to go with your new musical selections! \n\nRepeat as needed.
2	This place was packed and I was completely unimpressed. You stand in line for you meal, order, take your marker to the table and you're served. \n\nNot so bad, as I was looking for a light salad-type lunch. I ordered the chop-chop salad which was ok. The salad has wild Alaskan salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds served with Pesto Vinaigrette. \n\nWe also had the Emerald Spinach salad with chicken which was better. This salad has spinach, gorgonzola, bacon, red onion, spicy pecans, oranges, strawberries and red grapes with Balsamic Vinaigrette. \n\nAmbiance note: There's a Yelp and Facebook ad on every table. Seriously, the ambiance was institutional and very chain-like. It's a baby magnet and the acoustics are horrible as the metal ceiling caused the noise to bounce all over making for a really loud place to eat. \n\nLast, there's a bakery, but I honestly thought the bread was boring, bland and too tough of a crust.\n\nThis place may get a second chance, but only for take-out and no more Chop Chop salad. Portions are reasonable, but a far better salad is served at Paradise Deli with a lot more substance.
4	"""Overall it is a pretty nice casino. Its very modern, sleek, and clean feeling, and is decorated nicely. The lighting is also good. The restrooms and casino itself was pretty clean, except where there were smokers present. Fortunately when I was there, not too many people were smoking.\n\nOn my first visit I won $80 on the slots, so based on that I would say the casino may have been \loose.\"""" When signing up you get $10 in free play, and if you loose $100 within 24 hours, you get another $10 in free play. After that, I am unaware of how the comp system works, but you don't get $10 per $100 you loose after that. \n\nA rarity in casinos, they have a non-smoking section. It is way too small, and located in the very back of the casino, but at least it exists. It needs to be expanded, or better yet, they should just ban smoking all together.\n\nFor Arizona standards, they have a decently sized gambling space. There is an adequate amount of gambling space and a decent variety in slots available to play. \n\nWhats really missing is a buffet. A nice casino like this one needs a really nice buffet to go with it."""""""
1	"""This is my least favorite bar that I have been to in Old Town for one main reason.  THE MUSIC IS TOO LOUD!!  WHAT IS THAT??  THE MUSIC IS TOOOOO LOOUUUDDDD!!  I CAN'T HEAR YOU?? WHATTTT??  HUHHH??  (Hand gesture to the door) and you leave.\n\nThe biggest joke I was told was that this is the \#1 Lounge in Scottsdale\"""".  There is no way that is the case.\n\nI can't stand this spot.  The bartenders are good, but they can't even hear your order.  I have yet to have a good time here, and don't think much about coming back to this spot...even if it is busy."""""""
5	I found this place completely by accident and it was great!  I have been going pretty much once a week since discovering taco caliente. I love that you can choose from about 4-5 different meats and everything is completely fresh. .... Nothing is fried!  The service is good and the owner always stops to chit chat with me.  The salsa bar is pretty good and the hot is actually hot!  Love it!  Can't wait to go this week!  \nThe only thing is that I wish they were open later but I know they just opened recently.  Hopefully, they'll extend their hours soon. :)
1	"""\That's mold!\"""" my sister said to describe the green layers running through the entire cake that we had picked up only a couple hours earlier at the PV Chompie's.  The cake we had just put in front of our spouses and kids.  I loaded a picture of the cake that has to be seen to be believed.  How old does a cake have to be to have this much mold running through it?  It's shocking that food professionals would allow a product as dangerous as this one to be eaten.  We took it back from our family and back to the store. The GM gave us our money back and offered us something else.  She mentioned something about talking to the bakery about the cake.  This is one situation that a GM can't make right to the customer.  Dangerous food is unfixable, and a red flag to a potentially systemic food handling problem in the restaurant.  Nope.  Keep your replacement pastry.  In fact, keep anything else you've got to serve, Chompie's.  I value my family's health too much to risk serving them your food again."""""""
5	"""My family and I LOVE this place. So hard to find good chinese food, we lived in Avondale for 8 years and LOVED Wongs. Finally found a place in Surprise that is actually BETTER. Food is fresh and very tasty. We order from them probably once a month, love it. Crab puffs are to die for. I dont like the egg drop soup, tastes like \dirty\"""" water, not sure what it is I dont like, if its a seasoning or what, but, my boys and hubby like it so, who knows. They have a nice indoor ambience and an outdoor patio. You will not be disappointed in Big Buddha. I tell EVERYONE I know who lives out here about it. Great place."""""""
4	I came here once before a long time ago for a birthday bash. Because of the large size of the party, we were relegated to a large room separate from the rest of the bar.  At the time I thought it was good, very crowded and fun atmosphere.  As I was facing a white wall during most of the somewhat uncomfortable evening (ie My brother's friends, my Grandma and lots of booze), I barely noticed all the beautiful woodwork in the main bar area.\nI have been there twice this week.  Once for a nightcap and a second time for take out.  Both were very enjoyable.\nThe nightcap was after midnight and a few stragglers were ramped up and kinda vocal, but otherwise a friendly and warm atmosphere.  I minded my own business and discovered a drawing application I my phone which kept me entertained.  The Vodka soda was fine with fresh lime.  Bartender was friendly and did not try to rush anyone out- it was getting late and yet he was still relaxed and attentive.\nToday i picked up a turkey avacado sandwhich and it was great!  Thinly sliced Turkey w/ sliced avacado and Bacon on a nice roll.  Some tomatoes and lettuce and it was perfect.  \nI recommend checking this place out for both the food and the casual atmosphere.
4	This is one of those reviews that I wish I could give a half star to and make it 3.5. I've been teetering on 3 and 4, but I'm going to round up and give it four because I liked everything about this place, I just didn't love everything about it. \n\nI like that this is a homey little shop situated in a converted house. I like how they offer counter ordering as well as sit-down dining. I also like how they have an extensive ice cream selection staring at me when I walk inside. The food is decent. The bread is soft, the salad was ok. I got half and half...half Greek salad and a half of the prosciutto mozzarella sandwich based on the raving Yelp reviews.  The Greek salad was pretty tasty but they went really heavy on the dressing. Next time I will ask for it on the side. I liked the bread, vinegar, mozzarella and peppers in the Prosciutto sandwich. I wasn't a huge fan of the Prosciutto though. I found chunks in my Prosciutto and I just wasn't prepared for chunky meat, more the thinly sliced Prosciutto. The sandwich was ok though and I finished it, but I'll probably order something different next time. \n\nI know that a lot of the reviews talk about the service, but I thought the service was pretty good! The gentleman working the restaurant is an older man, with a tough East Coast attitude, but he softened up and tried to make light and friendly conversation in his own way. I enjoyed the service and it made me feel like I was in my old Italian relative's home for dinner. \n\nThis place definitely has character and I'm glad I paid it a visit. It's hard to remember to visit since it's on busy 7th Street and you can easily pass it before you realize you did. But if anything, I suggest you stop in for a homemade iced tea and gelato. The atmosphere is quaint and charming.
5	"""My new watch needed to have its metal-link bracelet resized and after a frustrating search (\We'll do it only if the watch was bought here\"""" ... \""""We don't have the right tools for that kind of bracelet\"""" ...), it occurred to me that I should have yelped it first! So after reading the more recent reviews for the establishment under new management (the 1st review is no longer valid - it was for the previous management; I'm waiting for yelp to take it down), I brought my watch here. Eddie was friendly, fast, and got the bracelet resized within a few minutes, for just 5 bucks. Now I know where to bring my watch for battery replacement, or if it ever needs repair in the future."""""""
5	I used to go to Churchhill's all the time for my smokes, but this place is closer and upon first glance, cheaper.  My inaugural experience was with my stogie-smokin' buddy Dave R.  We went right after the gym (natch) to get our supplies for that evening's drink fest.  Dave's been getting us our Ghurka Grand Reserve (amazing smoke) here for a while but I'd never been to the shop before.  They had a great selection of stogies and I picked up a new kind of Ghurka (for me anyway), a Ghurka Evil Torpedo.  Damn, it was good!\n\nThe proprietor was helpful and very friendly. I loathe connoisseur snobs of any kind and I feel like I often get that sideways, supercilious glance when entering cigar shops or wine stores -- not here.  100% helpful.  I did confound the poor guy as he was ringing us up when I was explaining to him that Dave was the Mayor of the shop on Foursquare.  Oh wells...\n\nGonna hit this joint again today for some Labor Day refills. Happy Smokin'!
4	Really good breakfast spot in-what is it? downtown? Old Casa Grande? whatever.  I took my dot out for breakfast here and was equally satisfied with the service and food just as I was on my first visit about a month ago.  I had the breakfast burrito sans papas (eggs, cheese and bacon)  pretty big burrito, however, two strips of bacon doesn't cut it for me, but it was still guud! Salsa is pretty good too\n\nThe dot had the french toast, which was scrumptious! Coated with corn flakes for an extra little crunch and not made with the typical Texas Toast, but with what appears to be a baguette.  The strawberry jam that accompanied the toast wasn't to my daughter's liking, so if you don't like it either, tell the waitress ;)  enjoy
2	"""If I lived next door I would probably show up from time to time - although there are several far better choices within 2 blocks [Carley's, Verde, Matt's, Portland's - many more if you're willing to go one more block].\n\nWent for lunch with my 18 year old daughter around 2:30PM on a weekday. No one there except 3 employees - who stayed in earnest discussion with each other as we entered and walked through the place. My daughter wanted to walk out - she felt like we were intruding. I even asked whether they were closed between meals. \n\nIt did feel as though we were intruding the entire time we were there. I had to ask for silverware and napkins even after being served drinks and, later, sandwiches. The servers were certainly NOT recruited for their professionalism. One woman walked in, looked over the visible fare, sauntered over to the counter and read the chalkboard menu for a few minutes. Not once was her presence acknowledged. She sauntered out. \n\nFood quality? Mine was good - albacore tuna, fresh tomato and lettuce, good bread. But Lays potato chips? c'mon... My daughter had \southwestern\"""" turkey - the turkey was real, but she couldn't understand why it was called southwestern - we decided that must've been some kind of code for \""""raised in the southwest\"""". \n\nService? Abysmal. Not snooty. Just sort of nonexistent. \n\nI had wanted to sample dinner sometime. I still might, but now only out of a sense of obligation to downtown.\n\nParking- they have a teensy private lot [this is a re-purposed building - this is it's first consumer retail use in at least 15 years]; parking used to be sufficient for business-to-business uses. There's some street parking available."""""""
5	Love this place!!!!  Have been here 3-4 times and have had a great experience each time.  The atmosphere is great both inside and outside.  The decor is modern yet cozy at the same time.  The food is fabulous.  The beets are phenomenal!  The brussel sprouts are fantastic.  The chicken and dumplings are the best comfort food and the salmon is terrific.  A friend of mine has had the mussels on several occasions and loves them.  The service is some of the best that I have seen.  From the time you walk in the door til the time you leave everyone treats you like they are truly happy you are there.  I high recommend Beckett's Table.  It is definitely one of my favorites!
2	Went for breakfast with my parents; after we were seated we immediatly got asked what we wanted to drink... drinks were brought out promptly. After that we were attented to for 5min, we ordered.... Meaty skillet, chicken fried steak and eggs and NY Strip & eggs. We waited over 25min for our food, the waitress didn't come by in the mean time to ask if we needed anything...we kept looking around for our waitress... everyone was very hungry and the resturant was not busy at all. By this time I was frustrated and wanted to leave. Food finallly got to us, EVERYONE poured salt/pepper and tobasco on our food... apparently no one's had any flavor. My steak was cooked like I liked but just wasnt doing it for me. The chicken fried steak was to die for (wish i had ordered it). The meat in the meaty skillet was close to non existant, and the salsa which was described as homemade was pace pecante sauce and awful. If I am craving CFS I will go here again, but never for anything else.\n\nSlow service, mediocore food and I wish we had gone to Dennys!
5	I am sorry, but I really like this place. \n\nIt has become a staple for my friends and I to spend our Monday and Thursday nights at this establishment.  They do treat their patrons as well as they know they can...and I am glad for that. \n\nJason, the bartender. 5 stars. I feel if he ever leaves this place it may lose what makes the Vig so great. Jason is to the VigU as Steve is to Apple. Thats how I look at it.\n\nFood:  Burger! Burger! I don't buy food here, because I like to cook my own food, but when I do its on Monday and I have not been able to find such a great burger for such a great price. #they sell out cuz it's such a great value. I do not even want to entertain the idea or repercussions if they ever decide not to offer the Monday burger special deal.\n\nBeer: Sleepy dog. Sleeeepy dog on Thursday for 5dolla pitcher...mix a little espresso vodka and it's an unrepudiated fact that you will like it and if you do not, you need to find a doctor because you might be crazy.\n\nR\\_\n\n*********Special thanks to Jason and the Vig for making our final touchdown of the night for my friend's bachelor party a great experience with no flaws and only great memories. LLTVU [LongLiveTheVigUp]
5	Suffered a senior moment today! Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review! lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer, sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful. Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why. Question is will I remember?
4	This place is a bit hidden, but it's a great place to snag a quick drink if you're going to be in the area anyway since it's next to Axis/Radius and Suede. I haven't sampled the food here, but browsing the menu I'd say the prices are a bit high for my budget. They do have bargain snacks late nights though for those of you who like to party at the nearby dance clubs. \n\nThere's not much I can complain about here - I was treated nice, the seats were comfy, and the drink was tasty. I don't know that it would be my type of place to grab a drink, but I'm more of a British Open Pub sort of guy... this place is a bit fancy and more pricey than I'm into - I'm actually afraid that this place and others like it are going to have hard times ahead with the recession... we'll see. It's a nice area of downtown and it's a nice bar. Make it your starting/meeting point or your final destination... and sample the food and let me know if it's any good - the bartender told me it's excellent.
4	Total hispter cupcake place. Isn't that awesome? Hipsters love cupcakes too. The whole place is eco-friendly and green and I'm fairly certain their packaging is recycled too. Featured (and conquered) on Cupcake Wars this place is a must visit on your lunch hour. On Thursdays they kindly allow the over so popular Luncha Libre food truck to post up outside their doors. I think just by being so friendly and co-inhabitant with the food truck scene alone makes them legit for sharing their space.
4	Nice New American spot in uptown Phoenix. Cool, contemporary decor with more than a little Ikea in the place. They have a bunch of seating options, with a dining room, bar, lounge, and patio. The dining room can be divided up for groups. \n\nSwitch has a reputation around town of being a gay friendly atmosphere and for using top quality ingredients in the food. This place is an excellent option for late night chow, as they're open to midnight every day. \n\nThe menu is a tasty combination of sandwiches, salads, burgers, and other comfort foods. Some interesting European inspired choices, too.  We had sandwiches the night we were there, and they were stellar. Amazing hummus on the side. \n\nOur server was great. We noticed that the place was a little dirty, though.They need to scrub the floors and clean or replace some of the textiles (pillows, cushions) around the place.
5	"""With 126 other reviews, there's not much to add. I did want to mention that in addition to great food, the staff is like a well-oiled machine. \n\nArriving just before shift change on a Saturday meant that there were literally a dozen girls on the floor. Servers, bussers, and hostesses. None, not one, of them stood around idle or glanced at a cell phone/PDA. They were a whirlwind of efficiency. Wiping tables, one would move a table - another would sweep under it, while yet another would \turn it\"""" with new condiments/napkins/hot suaces, et al. \n\nSame goes for the guys behind the line. A flurry of activity to crank out dish after dish. Awesome job! Awesome.\n\nI did ask for a takeout menu, but they don't have any - which is why none exist on the web, I guess. And, I did not snap a photo of the 4-pager myself. Sorry. We did grab a couple of food shots though - check those out."""""""
5	"""This place has it all over \thee-coffee-corporation-that-shant-be-named\""""... cheaper coffee which tastes miles better, text coupons and deals usually once a week or so, a frequent buyer card (buy 10 get 1 free, and don't forget double stamp Tuesday!), but what sticks out to me the most is the employees. Always friendly, which is nice, but more importantly...  *gasp!* completely competent (a rarity these days).  They always deliver spot on, and are really cool to boot. I will never, ever go anywhere else as long as these folks are around!"""""""
2	I believe that Cream Stereo Lounge claims to have the loudest sound system in the Valley. That might be the only credit I give them because after living outside of this bar for a year, I can attest that their stereo system is loud...and when I say loud, I mean it in a delirious-I-didn't-sleep-night-after-night-because-of-their-sound-system sort of way. But this review will not be solely based on my sleep deprived nights. \n\nI swore I would never enter Cream Stereo Lounge mostly because I knew it wouldn't be my scene and mostly because of my lack of sleep thanks to this Old Town spot. However, after years of avoiding Cream, I've been dragged their now twice and can say that it was everything I expected. \n\nI did the clubs. I can still do the clubs if the night calls for it. However, Cream Stereo Lounge is not quite the club for me. It's tiny, it's loud, it's normally not very crowded and the crowd that frequents this bar isn't for me. The drinks are pricey, the music is mixed and there isn't a ton going on there. They charge a cover which is rarely the case for a bar in Scottsdale and I don't think it would be worth it for a guy or girl to pay a cover to go to this bar.
2	Anyone remember Valley West Mall on 50th Ave & Northern right before it closed?  \n\nThat's what Chris-town Spectrum Mall feels like..  \n\nMy aunt worked here when I was a kid and that was back in the 80s when the mall was thriving with business and there were always a ton of great people walking around.  The food court  wasn't there just yet, but when that opened it gave it an even greater feel.  \n\nbut now..\n\nChris-Town... or face it.. lets just call it Spectrum Mall, is nothing but a ghetto run down store with a bunch of jewelry and urban clothing stores.  I'm shocked that they even have a nail shop inside... I dont mean an upper class one, I mean the ones you see in a strip mall.  The only stores that are recognizable are GNC, Bath & Body Works and shockingly... Wing Stop.. why the hell would they put a Wing Stop in there? wow..\n\nBig 5 Sports is pretty decent I guess too..\n\nI give this two stars because what was once a great mall is now nothing.  In my honest opinion, they should shut down the remaining mall section and just rebuild it as more big stores..  The only reason people go here now is Harkins, Wal-Mart, Target and JC Penny's..  oh and Costco. \n\nthink about it... What mall has all those outside stores attached to them?  None that I can think of.. unless they're hurting.\n\nRIP Chris-Town
3	OK so its an Old Country Buffet.  That pretty much sums it up.  Never been to OCB?  How about Golden Corral? \n\nThe food comes from a food service and is heated back up... how else could they serve so much for so little?  You can get a pretty good bang for your buck here.  TIP - sign up for their emails, and you'll get some BOGO coupons.\n\nWe go here a few times a year when we feel like being fat and eating nasty food, its a guilty pleasure.  Really what we go for is the entertainment.  Trust me - you will be the skinniest person in sight.  There's always something fun to keep you entertained, last time there was a woman (mother?) who kept putting her hands up her (7ish year old?) daughter's shirt, and down her skirt.  Something was probably up.  The time before that, the hippo family (really just the mom and dad) kept burping as loud as they could throughout the meal.  It must have been a contest.\n\nOK, food:  They usually have a guy at the grill cooking steaks.  Not bad steak for a buffet.  Pot roast is usually a safe bet, as is baked chicken.  They have all the usual canned, salty veggies as well as a lackluster taco bar, average salad bar, and enough desserts to keep the kids screaming.  Unfortunately they lack what every good buffet should have - good, fresh rolls/biscuits.  Don't bother.  \n\nService: Pretty good, they come by pretty often to clear dirty plates and offer drink refills.  Overall the servers are probably a lot happier than they should be for working here, but just as well that way.\n\nShould you eat here?  Of course!  Go on a night you feel like gorging/heading for a heart attack.  After a glance around the dining room you'll feel a lot better about your figure!
4	Now, you must understand that I just moved from Chicago where we have our very own gay sections of the city called Boystown and Andersonville.  I miss the land of widely accepted homosexuality that I traded for the desert.  Keep in mind, I am no gay man, but a gay woman that actually gets along with the boys.  \n\nI first ventured to BS West for a massive birthday party and just in time to catch their drag show on a Friday or Saturday night.  From the outside it looks huge, but once you get inside don't be afraid of a little body rubbing.  The queens put on a great show and afterwards they had some heavenly looking man meat for go-go dancers take the floor in tight banana huggers. (Was that graphic enough?)\n\nThere are random TV screens strewn about upstairs and downstairs with a video going along with the music, typical.  I could say that the music selection was a little drab.  I like just a little more house and a little less Top 40 hip/hop remix.  The bartenders are quick to get your order.  The drinks aren't the strongest, but the price won't break your wallet.  That's always nice.\n\nI have returned on 2 other occassions after discovering there are no lesbian bars in this great city.  Well, let me say lesbian bars with lesbians that don't look like your brother.  So, I will continue to have a fabulous time with my gay men at BS West and stare at the pretty straight girls who aren't afraid to dance with a straight looking gay lady.
4	They have made me feel like a VIP every time I visit for my cut and highlights/low lights. I am always confident in their work and feel like a million bucks every time I leave! One time I tried to die my own hair and it ended up very, very bad. I made an emergency appointment with them and I walked out with the best color and fix I could have asked for-They are well trained Life Savers! I took away one star because they pretty dang expensive, but when I have the money available I thoroughly enjoy this salon and appreciate the quality experience!
4	I must say I'm not a big fan of Yogurt shops to begin with however Mojo is alright.  They have 1000 different options to keep me entertained and the fresh fruit toppings are good.  The furniture and atmosphere is inviting and you could easily spend an hour just relaxing here... OK I'm changing this rating from 3 to 4 stars as I'm typing right now.  Be sure to join there online club and you will get frequent BOGO and 50% off deals.  \n\nNow if only we could get rid of 90% of the other Yogurt shops.  The yogurt bubble is bound to burst one of these days.
2	We came here after seeing the place on Triple D, and after hearing a few great reviews from some friends.  I tried what most yelpers seemed to be recommending.. the jade chicken quesidilla, and the jerk chicken rice.  The food to me tasted like what I would get if I were to mix taco bell and panda express together.  Not bad enough to not eat, but nothing I'll ever need again.  I think in theory the idea works, but the quality of the ingredients seemed to be lacking.  Maybe I just caught them on a bad day or at a bad time, but we most likely won't be going back any time soon, especially with so many better options in the valley.
5	Eduprize Queen Creek Jr High is the worst. The honor classes are NOT honor classes they are accelerated classes and when you switch your kids to public school they will not be able to keep up with honors classes. My child was a straight A student, loved math and hated it after Mr. Gaede for math. He is one of the worst teachers we have ever had. The aides also treat the junior high kids terribly. We switched to the gilbert school district. It took a little time but my child is finally catching up and is treated well at school. Ofcourse all the sports, music, cheer and lots more is a plus.
4	Breakfast foods are the best foods and, I'm pleased to report, Taylor's does the genre proud.\n\nI've dined here twice, both in the morning.  Taylor's is located on the NE corner of 44th St and Camelback and, if you want to find it quickly, you should turn into the complex when you see Cork 'N Cleaver.  Otherwise, prepare to drive around in circles wondering if the map on Yelp was wrong.  It's a little hard to spot at first.\n\nInside, you'll find a cute little cafe with cute little tables and a cute little patio.  It's so cute I could just squeeze it.  Seriously though, it feels exactly like a breakfast joint should.\n\nBut let's get to the good stuff: the food.  I'm a big fan of morning grub and Taylor's certainly delivers.  My first visit, I had a chorizo and egg dish that was perfectly cooked and reasonably priced.  More recently, I had the poached eggs with salmon which was a giant mouthful of delicious.  If I remember correctly, all the poached egg dishes were priced the same regardless of meat choice, so I had to make it count.\n\nI did knock off one star for the lackluster service we received on our most recent visit.  Still, if you're in the mood for some breakfast eats and the Good Egg sounds about as exciting as a Coldplay mixtape, give Taylor's a try.
1	I really want to love this place, the music, the location, the ambiance ...But for the five stars I really want to give them, they themselves take those much prized awards away. \nHere's another wannabe biker bar that won't allow colors in. strike one. The very poor customer service they continually have. strike two. The cockroaches in the bathroom and the condition of them. strike three.\nI'm a semi-regular (like once a week, that's over fifty times per year) and I still cannot give them any praise except that's it's cheap (sometimes, when they're not over charging/over ringing) and it's a good place to hideout for a while and replay some old music no else has\n...and to people watch, it's amazing what walks though these doors here.
4	Lovely. Local. Friendly. Fresh.  This is how I would describe the Grove Cafe, which serves a delicious breakfast Sat and Sundays.   This Venue at the Grove is primarily an event venue in a lovely farm-like setting amongst pecan groves.  I was thrilled when they decided to begin serving the greater public and sharing the lovely local with the rest of us schmoes out there.    \n\nIf you like The Farm at South Mountain, you'll love this place -- less attitude, more attentive service, and the same great quality food.   The owners are often out and about and very friendly.   So friendly in fact, that in a passing conversation we had mentioned that our son's birthday was coming up, and they remembered the next time we saw them.  Frankly, I was pleasantly shocked by that detail :)\n\nThe food is fantastic! And, if you live in Central Phoenix, it shouldn't take you more than 20 minutes to get there from the I10 -- super fast.   You won't regret spending the morning (especially in this weather) eating out doors in a quiet green setting.\n\nThe food is fantastic.  The chef comes up with wonderful specials -- just last week I had a BLT Omelet (Bacon, Tomato, Cheese and Arugula Salad...stuffed in the omelet).  My son and husband love the Stanley Omelet (Sausage and Cheese), and I'm a huge fan of their oatmeal served with fresh fruit and brown sugar.\n\nAnd for the record, they missed the 5th star because I'm a coffee snob and really dislike their coffee...but they do make a yummy hot-coco :)\n\nWe are frequent visitors so maybe I'll run into you sometime? :)
4	"""I made a solemn promise to my Yelp buddy, lain b., that I would give Franks Alot a try this week...well, it wasn't so much a solemn promise as more of a \if I happen to be in the neighborhood at lunchtime I will try to get by\""""...happily for me, it all worked out today:)\n\nI had the traditional Power Yoga class at the Village today (the class was brutal today...with a capital \""""BRU\""""... but I toughed it out:)\n\nAfter class, I needed something...something...what can retox your system any better than that big dose of unidentifiable beef parts that are first ground into a slurry and then soaked in nitrates that I like to call a \""""Vienna All Beef Wiener\"""":)???\n\nAlmost nothing, that's what (with the possible exception of unblended, 24 year old, highland malt scotch whiskey...but I am still working this afternoon...so hot dog it is:)\n\nI motored down 40th, past LGO, I saw the Chicago Hamburger sign beckoning off to my right, all wanting my business, all tasty and singing to me as I passed by, but I pressed on to my goal!\n\nI was almost on the runways at Sky Harbor before I finally found this place...it's a long way down 40th:)\n\nI don't get to this part of town very often...not really much for me to do here, but even though it's a schlep, I can see it becoming a hot dog destination.\n\nFrom first glance, you can tell that Franks Alot is a hot dog joint...drive through or walk up...cash only sign...no inside seating (although it was nice eating on the covered patio with the misters going and classic rock over the acoustically impaired speakers...made me feel like I was 17 again and sitting outside at Luke's in Monmouth...right down to \""""Spirit in Sky\"""" warbling away at me:)\n\nI gotta agree with lain...Franks Alot makes a good hot dog!\n\nI had 2 foot longs, just to see what these wieners are made of (oh wait...I remember now...beef parts slurry, etc...see above:)\n\nThey steam the Vienna All Beef Wieners (I just like writing wiener as often as possible:), serve them in warm fluffy poppy seed buns (I don't have to worry about the drug tests...drug use is encouraged for software developers:)...they have celery salt to sprinkle on your wiener (insert joke here:) which is almost always worth a star!\n\nThey've got a lot (probably where the name comes from) of different sausages at Franks Alot...the special today was a polish sausage, and they have brats, red hots, etc.\n\nThey do chili dogs, Chicago style, bacon wrapped...you know...all the healthy options:)\n\nI might even try one of those variations one of these days.\n\nBut for now, I'm happy with the good old standby...the foot long hot dogs!\n\n$8.55 for 2 foot longs and barrel of diet coke...that's more than $3.00 less than Ted's for the same thing...and I didn't have to wait in line for 45 minutes:)"""""""
1	OK. So I think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me.  I just flew home from Israel on this airlines.  Boy, they are pretty sad.  I usually don't like to be too harsh on anyone, but this airlines deserves it.  \n\nPlease, don't think of this review as complaining, but rather a warning to others out there to never fly US airways (Nobody likes a complainer right? Haha.).  Well, not never, but if you have no other choice.  I would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered.  You could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par.  I guess I have been spoiled with the likes of Hawaiian Airlines, Nippon airlines, shoot, you can even throw Delta in there.  The flight attendants are rude. This is from both personal experience and from observation of my own.  \n\nYou know what, I could go on and on, but I really don't like to cry about stuff.  Would I fly US Airways again? No way.  If it was one of the last airlines on Earth?  Maybe.  I just hope that their service of customers get better.\n\n  Then again, maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that I hadn't shaved and looked Talibanish.  Oops.
1	Wow, I never would have expected a hotel this dirty and unsanitary. I am not one to be picky when getting a cheap hotel, but holy smokes was this place nasty. The shower was clogged, the bathroom had hair all over it by the bunches, the kitchen was not cleaned, the bed had stains all over it. The television didn't get every channel and the homeless people didn't help. I'm just stunned at such filth. Please do follow my advice and avoid this dump. It was straight out of a movie
1	Yes, I am giving this place 1 darn star!! Let me explain why..\nThursdays, 50 cent drinks until midnight.. nice.. but NOT worth it!\nFirst off, it's so packed! And sweaty! \nEveryone is totally s*faced and there is always bound to be drama!\nI got kicked out of there once when I was not even making a scene, ugh.. \nMy phone was stolen there, seriously, why??\nMy mp3 player was stolen there.. wtf?\nSome guy stole MONEY from me there and no one did a thing when I told security. \nThe guys there look like they all have two baby mamas and live at home.\nThere are always random fights breaking out. \nI don't know, I'm sooo not into this place, it was a true nightmare and I'm scarred for life from my experience there.. be careful everyone!
5	I have driven by US Eggs several times on my way in or out of Old Town Scottsdale.  US Eggs has to have one of the tallest buildings I have ever seen for a restaurant.  One morning, I decided to give it a shot.  I did a little research on Yelp, and I saw that people enjoyed the protein pancakes.  I eat quite a bit of protein supplements, so I was wondering if they somehow infused whey protein powder into the pancake batter.  It actually has fresh blueberries, cinnamon, and almonds.  I think the batter had whole grain wheat.  I decided to go with the half and half, which gave me 2 mini protein pancakes (humongous) and an Idaho Skillet that came with potatoes, your choice of 1 egg, and a type of sauce such as Cajun spices, Santa Fe, or various other assortments.  Each of my friends got the same dish, but with different skillet sauces.  We enjoyed the Cajun, Santa Fe, and chicken avocado.\n\nThe best part of the experience is that you definitely get your money's worth.  If you ever have a hard workout or are extremely hungry, come to US Eggs for a power-packed breakfast.
1	This practice needs work! My first problem - they have SO many doctors, you never see the same one. I think it's very important that children see the same pediatrician, so the doctor really knows the child should any problems develop. Also, I think it's great for children to know who they are going to see and trust them. While I liked the two doctors we ended up seeing a lot, I did not like the fact that I had no control of who we were seeing, it was just whoever was available. Secondly, and the main reason we left the practice is that their front office staff is HORRIBLE. Slow and lazy. When I would call in for an appointment, even though I was calling 1 month ahead of time to schedule vaccinations, I was told they were full and couldn't get in for 2 months. HUH? I wanted to stay right on a vaccination schedule and they couldn't accommodate me to set an appointment a month ahead?? That is ridiculous! What would happen if we had an emergency or major sickness and couldn't get in. Would I be told no, sorry no availability. This practice has a good reputation because it's been around a while, but quite frankly, I think it's too big, with TOO many doctors. There is absolutely NO personal service or relationships and I'm glad I saw it early on and left before I wasted any more time with this practice. I would NEVER recommend this practice to anyone!

4	This is the best way to watch a movie!! Great service and comfortable seating. At first i was not sure of the office chairs, but I now prefer those to the standard theatre seating. As far as food goes, we have many favorites- quesadillas, nachos ( messy but good) , hot chocolate chip cookies and sliders. We have tried the chicken tenders and they seemed like they came out of a bag. The popcorn is good, just make sure to ask for it with hot butter. Free refills on sodas and ice tea and you never have to get up. Watch for groupons as well.
5	The Renaissance Festival is a place where everyone and anyone can venture to in order to awaken their medieval passions and expose a side of them no other place can reveal.  Here people can be themselves without fear of being judged.  They can dress in clothing appropriate to the era, eat as citizens of the renaissance age would eat, and live a day in the shoes of people whose lifestyle consisted of these aspects every day of their lives, all while having a merry time.\n\nWhat's fascinating about the Renaissance Festival is it is an escape from the everyday bustling industrial environment known to people of the 21st century.  Once you pass through the gates, you are immersed in a culture rarely seen these days.  Men, women, and children of all ages absorb the spirit of the festival and change into someone only such a place can expose.  Immediately you are compelled to have high spirits as people dancing, shopping, and just continuously enjoying themselves welcome you to the festival.  From there the opportunities are limitless for there are twelve stages of continuous live entertainment, jousting tournaments, over 200 artisans displaying a variety of unique wares, and displays of ancient skills like glassblowing, leatherworking, weaving, woodcarving, blacksmithing, candlemaking and pottery.\n\nOne specific entity of the Renaissance Festival that stands out in my mind is the old coin striking mill tucked away and blended into in the strips of stores surrounding it.  Here, a family of three (father, mother, and daughter) work to produce unique coins crafted into necklaces by means of a punch press.  \n\nThe store offers some 100 different punch dyes each a symbol possessing its own special meaning.  The categories range from mythological symbols, to astrological, to even ancient Egyptian.  Once their customer has chosen two of their own special symbols they want imprinted on a coin, they place a blank, either bronze or silver, between each dye and clamp it to a press.  Then a heavy weight is hoisted a few feet above the dyes and then suddenly dropped onto the head of one dye, eternally imprinting the symbols on the coin.  \n\nWhat's distinctive about this certain store is they can fulfill the needs of any customer that they are presented with by owning such a broad spectrum of dyes applicable to anyone due to the meaningful descriptions given to each symbol.  Additionally, what captivates people is the fact that the coin is formed before your very eyes three feet away, making the production a very personal thing for the consumer.  \n\nIf you and your family are venturing to the Renaissance Festival in Arizona anytime soon, which I would undoubtedly recommend, be sure to stop in on this special experience not attained anywhere else close by.
2	"""I wanted to like this place because I like pizza and subs, which is what they do. But after giving it two tries two days in a row, I have to provide my \completely honest review\"""" to you. So here it is: \n\nDay 1: I ordered a turkey sub. It took a long time to arrive. I mean about 15 minutes. For a sub. I know, right? And I was in town on business so was dining with a few coworkers. They each had a similar wait. \n\nWas the sandwich worth the wait? Not really. It was mostly bread and just a little meat. They threw some mayo on it, but it's probably my fault for not asking for more stuff. If that was even an option. Which I don't know. But I do know the sub needed more. A lot more. \n\nNow in fairness, I should tell you that they do provide a free, small fixins bar. This contains an assortment of peppers and pickles. So I could have and should have doctored it up with some of that stuff. \n\nDay 2: I came in with a coworker for a quick slice of pizza before we headed back to the airport. Except it wasn't so quick. I ordered a single slice of pepperoni and they went to heat it up for me. This was a nice touch. \n\nI got to talking to my colleague and lost track of the time. I also wasn't expecting to get my slice fast because my long wait from the previous day was still fresh in my mind. So after another 10 or 15 minutes passed, I went to ask about my pizza. \n\nThe server went to the oven, opened it, and stood back as a big cloud of smoke came billowing out. Oh they didn't forget to put my pizza IN the oven. They just forgot to take it OUT. And we were literally the only two customers in the place.\n\nThey heated another one up for me. And did not burn this one. The pizza was average but not bad. \n\nSo all in all, not the greatest experience either time. I'd probably just pass on this and go to one of the other spots nearby. There's a much better pizza place just two doors down."""""""
5	"""I am a big fan of dive-type bars.  Why the hell I've never been to the Coach House is beyond me.  I came here on a Saturday for the first time and loved every second that I was here.  The inside of this place is about the size of my office cubicle, which makes for a nice cozy gathering.  Crammed in here you will find a golden tee machine and a pool table, along with a small bar area to hang out at.  I personally recommend getting a mini-pitcher of beer for yourself, but if the hard stuff is your flavor they've got a full bar, including decent wine.  The bartenders were a little slow, but on a crowded night I give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe patio area of the Coach House is a great place to be.  It has its own outside bar and is complete with misters to cool you down while you people watch folks from all walks of life coming in and out of this place.  You've got your hippies, your golfers, your students, your working professionals, and luckily some girl with a top on that showed off pretty much everything, including \the twins.\""""  She didn't seem to mind the extra attention everyone with a Y chromosome was giving her.\n\nThis seemed to be a popular spot for people to flock to towards the end of the night for a couple of last minute drinks and to hang out with friends before calling it a night.  I plan on being one of those types of people at this place as often as I can, as I will definitely make this a regular spot for me."""""""
3	Good and bad.\n\nFirst the good: They have a great skeet, trap and sporting clays range and the range officers were very nice and helpful on me and my buddy's first time trying sporting clays. Several officers noticed he was having problems hitting clays as he's used to shooting scoped rifles. They all stopped by and offered their help in a non-threatening and polite manner and even used their own credits to not waste ours' during the instruction.\n\nTheir small bore range is very nice and of the matches I have been to have had great experiences. Went to Winter Ranger one year and was very impressed on how that was set up.\n\nNow the bad: the public range. The range officers always seem to be cranky and also generally not friendly. I can kind of see why because the other bad is because of some of the shooters there. They are unfamiliar with their weapons or downright don't care. There are some dangerous people on that range. I have been swept with the muzzles of both loaded and unloaded gun NUMEROUS times. Sometimes the officers see, but usually not. I tend to see them more concerned about some very minor violation or making their own rules up. And as I said, just seem to be downright cranky. From what I understand they are all volunteers but that is no excuse. If you can't check your attitude at the door and don't enjoy what you are doing, don't do it.\n\nI used to like the public range for sighting in rifles and scopes, but now skip it due to the dangerous shooters and the poor attitude of the range masters. But the skeet and small bore areas are good to go!
3	We stopped in for a couple of drinks on my last night in town. This is a cute neighborhood that I wish I'd had more time to explore (things were closed on Easter). I'm glad the Lost Leaf was open the next night though, because we got to try some local brews, relax and enjoy the interesting art, and take in some jazz. It was pretty hopping for a Monday night. The only less-than-great thing was the bartender's attitude left a little something to be desired.
5	Oh, Bookman's...you clean up nice!!!  \n\nThe facelift Bookman's received recently is A-mazing!  It is organized, clean, ...did I say organized?  It is so easy to find the cashier, exchange, cafe, kid's area, etc.  I LOVE it!  Plus, the entire store that day smelled like BACON.  I guess BLTs were on the menu that day.\n\nI brought some items in to trade (actually I needed the cash).  So while I waited, and enjoyed the scent of smoked pig in the air, I browsed the various sections of the store.  I was very impressed at the organization of the store.  \n\nDuring my trade, I found they offer about 1/3 the cash versus the amount they will give you in credit to the store.  I took the credit.  I will spend it in more books.  Or maybe I will try the BLT.\n\nP.S. They give teacher discounts, but you must have your ID, plus a letter on school letter head stating you are currently employed as a teacher.  Wow, they are getting tough on those teachers!  LOL.
3	You know when you make a copy of the original and its not quite the same? Juts a little fuzzy around the edges, not as sharp but usable? That is how I felt at the new location of Market Bistro. Similar vibe that I enjoy at the original isn't quite as pulled together at this location. Maybe the lack of a lounging area or the weird particle board chic tables? Or the fact that every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace (front entrance).. maybe the grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill? No forks? I'm sorry if I sound like a banging on MB.. but these are things that can be improved on. \n\nThe Mr and I shared a salad and a Cuban sandwich.. the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making.. this was probably the best salad Ive made to date.. you should be able to patent your creations! The Cuban sandwich was okay.. the ciabatta rolls are so thick and chewy that when you take a bite the toppings sort of fire out the back.. for a Cuban sandwich I think it had some sort of Asian spice, like cardemom?? Anyway, the Mr didn't like it at all. This being his first time he was confused as to why I went on and on until he took a bite of my patent pending salad, then it all made sense to him. The salads are just so complete and delicious!\n\nI look forward to coming again.. I just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely.
5	Everytime I go to AZ88 - I am always happier.  Lets start with the Aviation martini - made with Noblets Gin, Luxardo and Creme de Violet - shaken, straight up - it is by FAR the most amazing cocktail I have ever feasted on! \nThe bartenders and staff are always warm, friendly and make perfect martinis.  They always manage to fill it all the way to the rim, without wasting a drop! How they always do that in every drink, is beyond me.  I don't see them measure, which will ruin a drink anyway.  Drink making is an art, that must be felt.  They nail drinks here. \nFood - amazing.  From simple chips to salads to the amazing chicken sandwich I ate, I can't find one bad thing to say about them \n\nThe decor in the lovely place is stark and white and very contemporary. Perfect for the artsy district they reside in. Keep up the great job!
3	My first time. First impression, this is a better burger chain. It would take several visits for me to compare Habit to In 'n Out, Smash Burger, Five Guys etc. So I will go with the menu and the house habits. \n\n I ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich on sourdough and fries. $6. Fries. $1.80 My sandwich was really good. Eating in the car was a mistake tho. Meat falls out and one of the tooth picks in the sandwich wound up in my mouth. \n\nMy tri-tip BBQ sourdough (the Habit Burger Grill) $5.95\nCalories 476 Sodium 1630 mg. Total Fat 19g. Saturated 4g.

5	This is the perfect place to go on a nice day.  Even if the weather isn't good, its still a great place to go.  There isn't a whole lot of seating inside, but there is enough for a good amount of people.  However I don't think Joe wants us to eat inside :)  .  \n\nWhat I really like about this place is their setup.  It's different than anything that you have seen before, and just for that it becomes an enjoyable place.  \n\nThere food is good too,  now I have only eaten there once, so I can only comment on the food I had (the Pulled Pork Sandwich).  It was actually really good.  From other places, ordering the same thing, you sometimes get so much bbq sauce that you cant taste the pork.  Not at Joes Farm Grill :) Their normal fries are good, but next time I will have to try the other varieties.  \n\nOverall, Good Food, Great Atmosphere and I will go back.  I recommend anyone to go there if you are in the Gilbert area.
5	"""There's not much more I can say about Postino than hasn't already been said... the food is incredible, the wine list is extensive, the menu is reasonably priced, the ambiance is delightful, and the service rocks!\n\nI was there last night and enjoyed the $20 bottle of wine + bruschetta deal after 8 p.m. The portions on the bruschetta deal were surprisingly generous, and amazingly delicious! I went with the mozzarella with tomato and basil, the goat cheese with roasted peppers, the smoked salmon with pesto, and ricotta with dates and pistachios; I loved the first three, but I would not order the date and pistachio bruschetta on my next visit. \n\nI also ordered the \pick two\"""" panini and salad/\""""soup of the moment\"""" combo, with the Brie and prosciutto panini and a healthy serving of tomato soup. The panini was scrumptious! It was perfectly prepared, and tasted amazing ... I wish I had ordered the full sandwich! The soup was just OK - it wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as exciting for my tastebuds as the panini. \n\nI would liken my dining experience at Postino to \""""If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\"""" -- after I had one phenomenal item, I had to have them all! After polishing off a bold and zesty Syrah from California, I ended up leaving with a bottle of the Reunion Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina. Restaurant patrons receive $9 off bottles of wine to-go, so I mean, I wasn't gonna not... (perfectly acceptable use of double negatives).\n\nAlthough it is a trendy spot, Postino has somehow managed to remain friendly and unpretentious - both staff and guests alike. The servers all know their stuff and are more than happy to provide recommendations based on your preferences. Even the least sophisticated palate will feel comfortable dining here on account of the helpful service and charming atmosphere; hence why I hereby award Postino with my first 5/5 star review! \n\nAproveche, my friends!"""""""
3	I guess if a rowdy place on the 17 is your place, then you'd like this one. \nI was here for a gig ( a lot of my reviews seem to have that in them. What can I say? I'm pretty funny.)\nThey have several TVs for your football needs. I was here on a Monday night and the crowd was pretty attentive to us comedians. A lot of support from the venue helped with that.\nThough I didn't get it, they have a pretty cheap steak dinner. It definitely smelled good! \nBartenders were attentive and friendly. They remembered my drink throughout the evening.\nOh, and if you see a guy there who looks like Snoop's chubby, poor cousin, do NOT make eye contact. Guy waited for me outside the bathroom door! Creepy, but luckily I had comics there to save me.
3	Meh.  I've been to this bar a few times and find it's not worth the hassle.  First of all, your chances of actually parking in their parking lot are slim to none.  It's very annoying trying to find a spot, but you will have better luck parking in some of the neighboring places.\n\nSecondly, the drinks are WEAK.  Pretty lame.  They're cheap, but sometimes I think the bartender completely forgets the alcohol entirely. Did I say a soda water?? I meant vodka/soda!! Come on now, people.  Don't be so stingy with the good stuff. \n\nThe crowd is pretty eclectic.  I've seen quite a few different age ranges in there the times I've gone, but no one seems to have a problem with dancing out on the floor.\n\nThis is not the best bar choice, but it's not the worst either. Just bring your own alcohol minis so you can doctor up your drinks.
2	The dim sum was pretty tasty the first time I went. \n\nThe second time I went,  we ordered vegetable fried rice...maybe the chef was having an off night, but the veggies were straight from the freezer bag and still cold. (you know, the little orange carrot cubes and peas from that mixed back in your local grocery store freezer?)  That off night turned us off to the place - how hard is to to chop some carrots up and stir fry with some rice..so we never went back. \n\nIts big inside and the entry way has statues and such that are entertaining to look at. Stick with the Dim Sum.
4	OK so I live walking distance from Fashion Square mall and  have passed by Modern Steak the last two weeks before it was actually opened. I got to see the incredibly AMAZING decor and instantly fell in love based on that and was dying to try it. Lucky for me I had a special occasion this week - my husband's b-day and a reason to go.\n\nThe food:\nDelicious! I had the roasted beet salad with pistachios - amazing fresh, light, perfect! I also had the chilean seabass with miso sauce and mushrooms - flavorful, light and flakey magnifiqu! For dessert the chocolate tort with ice cream... comes piping hot and is heavenly.\n\nMy hubs had the chopped salad and a NY strip steak. He enjoyed it but I'm not sure if as much as I did my dish. Also he is allergic to dairy and since they didn't have any dairy -free desserts on the menu they actually offered him a free dessert wine and put together a berry dish for him. They also mentioned that they will re-evaluate the menu to offer some dairy-free options. Nice! A solid review from him!\n\nThe service:\nfabulous! the wait staff was attentive, kind and very accommodating. We started out with a party of two at a cozy back booth and ended up with TEN people as our friends came to join. The waiter was totally cool with us taking over the area and added chairs... it was great. Of course they are trying hard since they just opened on Monday. I really hope they keep it up.\n\nThe Decor:\nFor me - soul stirring! I LOVE the design of the space and felt inspired sitting in there for the evening.\n\nAll in all a great experience :)
4	I will go ahead and review what I've had here. This was a last minute stop on one of my Saturday food fests. Unfortunately I did not get to try nearly the amount of what I wanted to. I've driven by this place so many times and I've read so much about it I just had to stop in here and get some grub. Next time will be with a big group so we can order some of everything.\n\nThey have a much larger menu at the location then they do online. So many sides to choose from, so many desserts to try, so much BBQ to sample. I really wanted to try the fried pickles, and greens because I love these things but there was just no room. I've been trying to find good greens in phoenix and have yet to find any that take me to that happy place encountered the first time I had them back east somewhere.\n\nFood:\n\nSauce:\nThe sauce was good.. but it wasn't great. It was missing.. something.. I don't even know what. I know they are very proud of it and maybe its just that my southwest palate is ruined by the super sweet, super hot, super tangy stuff we are used to. The problem with this is everything comes very very sauced. Again.. I though it was good. I think lots of people love it so dont get turned off by this you might love the stuff.\n\nPork Ribs 1/2 slab $9.99:\nWhat a great deal! I think I had damn near 12 ribs in there. I honestly wonder if they accidentally made me a full slab as this was a GIANT portion of ribs. The picture I took was after already having 3 of the darn things. Not only was this huge but was also a good $5 cheaper for a 1/2 then most places in the valley charge. I removed the sauce *mostly* from one of them and tasted just the meat. It had a nice natural smokey flavor, falling on the to lite side if anything. It had a great texture, very tender without totally falling off the bone. I hate to break it to most people but falling off the bone for ribs generally means it was just over done. There is a rib sweet spot between having a texture and falling off the bone and Stacy hits it. When you have it the first time you'll know and see what you've been missing.\n\nRed Velvet Cake $3.00:\nI have discovered that I'm just not a fan of this. I had it at lolo's and people RAVE about it and I just didn't dig it. When 50 people tell me something is great and I dont get excited about it I assume I need to try it elsewhere or again. So I gave it a try here and same reaction. The frosting rocks.. how can it not? its cream cheese! But the cake, at both places, not much going on. Its like a yellow cake mix that is dyed an ungodly red that is missing 1/2 the sugar the recipie called for. I just don't seem to like this cake in general so if lolo's has the best in phoenix I would say its a lie since this tasted almost identical. Now you know you have two places in phoenix that have great red velvet cake. Next time I'm going to try pecan or sweet potato.\n\nSadly this was all I got to try. I'm basing my review on the ribs and sauce alone. I'm leaving the cake out of the equation since clearly its just not something I would love anywhere. Can't hold them accountable for that :) I will be back and will update.\n\nIs this the best BBQ I've ever had? No its not, but it may very well be the best BBQ I've had in phoenix. I have a few more places on the list to try and will update ratings as necessary.\n\n\nPros:\nLocal Joint Service: The ribbing/joking/family type treatment.\n\nLarge Selection: Dare you not to find SOMETHING that looks tempting on this menu.\n\nAffordable: This has a bit of a catch will I will go into in the cons.\n\n\nCons:\nLimited Seating/Parking:\nI had zero problems the evening I went but I can imagine during a rush this would be awkward. I have no clue where you would even wait. Out in the parking lot I suppose.\n\nNo Plastic:\nThey seem to have added an ATM inside recently as I see no other mention of this. I meant to check on the fee. I would guess its probably pretty steep so your better off stooping on the way but if you forget they have you covered.\n\nZero Combination's:\nThere are no combos here. You order meat.. and you order sides. You get A LOT of BBQ for what they charge but if your going by yourself its going to be a little pricey. If you go with a group it would a much better deal.\n\nHeavy Sauce: I would ask for light sauce or sauce on the side. If you like your BBQ swimming order it straight up and you'll be a happy camper.
5	... Apologies, I was just daydreaming about the Green Burger.\n\nIf I could suggest to a meat-eater a place for them to experiment with eating like a veg, no doubt this would be the place.\n\nIf I could suggest to a veg a place to have a mouth-gasm, no doubt this would be the place.\n\nOk, now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk food. They have delicious salads, and was look like good personal-pan style pizzas. I'm a fan of the huge, size-of-your-face pizza slice persuasion, so I've never gone that route at Green.\n\nRegardless, I would be willing to slap a $5 down on the table in front of someone at Green, and if they didn't like the food, they could take it and walk.\n\nTheir tofu/mock-chicken/mock-beef/mock-pork bowls are yum, yum, yum. I stick with the Singapore tofu, and it never fails to make my stomach smile.\n\nAnd their tsoynamis are oh-so good. No, that's not a mistake, people. It's a soy Dairy-Queen-blizzard style cup full of sunshine. EVERY one I've tried has blown me away. Some I like better, but I can't judge. It's sweet. It's soy. It's goooood.\n\nSometimes when it's lunch time, or a busy Friday or Saturday night, this place can get packed. It's usually full of the hipster and indie kinds of people, but, that shouldn't in any way make you not want to eat there, especially if you don't look this way. Eff all of that, go for the food if nothing else.\n\nService is always spot on, and they're always keen to help you decide or answer questions.\n\nIf you want a good, entertaining view of all the fixie-riders (there's a bike shop next door, no lies!), albeit simply amazing food, I'm going to say go here.\n\nP.s. The ladies bathroom has a cool piece of artwork hanging on the wall and an even cooler faucet fixture for the sink.\nP.p.s. The artwork in this place is beyond bitchin'.
5	"""Over two years in Phoenix and my first dinner at Barrio still stands as my best meal since arrival.  Started with the house margarita, which was great.  Also have tried the Organic Margarita, and it is spectacular.  Decide how much you feel like spending and order accordingly, there is no wrong answer to this question.  Except maybe \No thanks\"""".  I shared the Chiles en Nogada and the Pescado del Mar.  I can't pick a favorite, possibly due to the brain damage from the firestorm of joy transmitted from tongue to pleasure center.  Chiles en Nogada is a twist on the classic Chile Relleno, they start with a large fresh poblano pepper, stuff it with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, and I seem to recall pomegranate and angel dust, then top it with an absurdly tasty almond cream sauce.  Pescado del Mar is pan roasted halibut sort of stuffed/topped with crab, shrimp, lobster, and scallops, finished off with chorizo and another different, obnoxiously good cream sauce.  For dessert, absolutely get the churros.  Do remember the little cinnamon sticks that the word churro implies, but imagine them expertly prepared, stuffed with goats milk caramel and vanilla bean ice cream.  Service was friendly and efficient, the wait was long, but that was expected.  The Sunday brunch is also very much worth checking out, particularly for the seafood crepes.  My only disappointment from El Barrio so far was my own fault.  I didn't feel like waiting for a table and made the mistake of chosing Fish Tacos for a to-go order.  The shelf life on fish tacos is not long.  By the time I got home, we had a Captain Crunch enemy standoff going.  (Soggies...if you needed the clarification)"""""""
5	A bar with one of the best views around that serves up amazing cocktails as well?! If I lived in PHX, I'd be taking all my dates here. Gorgeous, cozy, romantic... LOVE IT!\n\nThe bartenders are all very friendly, and they are fantastic mixologists. I absolutely loved my Bourbon Sidecar. And you can get a little piece of SF here - yes, they have Fernet!\n\nLocated at Sanctuary Resort, you can enjoy drinks inside the swanky lounge or even better - take your cocktails outside onto the secluded patio, get comfy by the fire pit or under a heat lamp and star gaze.\n\nSWOON.
4	I've been here for the live cooking and loved it. I went last night to use my birthday certificate and found them to be really crowded, with a wait for everywhere. I was bummed, but I had to use my certificate that day. I got put on the list, but the hostess didn't ask which list I wanted to be on (chef's table or regular) and I assumed that meant I would get the first available. However, we went to check and she said that there was a wait for the regular dining and would I like to be on that list too. Well, yeah. I didn't come here to sit. I asked about the lounge area. It had a wait too. Basically you can go get a drink and take it back to the waiting area. Ugh, ok. Thankfully when we got seated, the server was really cool. I forgot his name, they don't seem to have name tags. He was great, the food was good, so the experience was saved. Just dealing with that hostess who didn't want to willingly provide information was a pain. I've seen perkier people working at Denny's. A place of that caliber should make better sure that people who are paid to make you feel welcome in that establishment at least smile.
2	This place is fairly cheap and looks like it could be fun, but tonight it was kind of empty, although we went fairly early. They had karaoke which was extremely loud and the bar had many older people there. Our waiter was not super awesome, we waited for a long time to get our tab and came to find out he was singing karaoke.... very poorly. So that is not real appealing. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go here.
3	I have been to Kyoto about 3-4 times in the past 7 years.  I still hasn't changed a bit since the first time I went there when I was fifteen!  I always eat at the grills.  I love places with the tepanaki (I dont know how to spell it) grills.  I have been to many many places like this and Kyoto is just ok.  This place needs some serious redecorating.  It looks like the place is stuck in the 1970's.  The food is good though.  Last time our grill cook was really bad and was droping things all over the place but hey everyone has an off day sometimes.  I may go here again just because its so close to my home but otherwise I've had better.
5	This place is under new ownership. It has been for about 2 months... I know this because mine and my moms nail lady Lindsay, that we have been going to for years, took over this shop and is now running it. :) Her husband and sister also work there with a few other awesome employess. All of them are talented and true artists. My mom and I have NEVER had more compliments on our nails. They all do great work. My mom is now driving 30 minutes one way just to go to Lindsay. Yes! She is that good. (I work close by where she opened the shop so I got lucky lol) They have tons of designs to choose from that they hand paint and they are great with designs to meet the needs of every season! They do waxing, facial massages, pedicures, manicures, gel, powder.. whatever you need. They take walk ins with little or no waiting time. Never have had a fungus or any issues like that whatsoever. The place is very clean and decorated beautifully and the massage chairs are awesome! :) Looking for top quality work from skilled professionals then this is the place! I wont go anywhere else. :)
3	We went here mainly because of the location and the dog friendly patio.  The patio itself is very nice and has a lot of well shaded areas to keep you cool from the hot sun.  We had breakfast here, which was a mixed experience meal-wise.  I had the Hawaiian French toast ($8.75) which was disappointing to me.  The only thing that seemed to make it Hawaiian was a few slices of banana placed on top of the French toast.  The menu listed a molasses batter for the toast, but I couldn't taste much molasses flavor.  In addition, the toast itself looked overcooked and tasted dry.  For $8.75, I would have liked to see more ingredients than some slices of banana on top of 2 sliced pieces of battered toast (Maybe some pineapple? Or grilled ham?).\n\nMy husband had the biscuits and gravy platter (Around $10), which I thought was much better value wise and taste wise.  The gravy was rich and delicious, and it was a large amount of food since it came with bacon, potatoes, and 2 eggs.  I also tried the short rib benedict, which was nicely cooked, with great flavor.  \n\nSo while I didn't really enjoy my dish, the others I tried were very good.  I'd like to go here again to try more dishes, but be aware of what entrees to get!
5	What is not to love ?? \n\nI didn't realize i was a sunbird (until Fred F.pointed it out to me) and the title fits ..\nAs a native of the east coast for 45 yrs freezing my tukhus off ,i can attest to the fact that to be out and about in December is a beautiful thing ...no doldrums of blah,blecky gray skied weather ..just smiling sunshine raining down upon me ,my car looks shiny and salt free ,and the nightmare of black ice is just a bad memory .\n\nI won't lie and say i don't miss wearing my mink coats(from Oct-Mar) ,and that the holiday season here takes some getting used to (only because i equate cold with christmas tree's and decorations)...still ,trading in my minks in Dec.for super cool pashmina's and cute capelettes wasn't that hard to do ...and what native Phoenicians find freezing temps here at night ,i find to be a cozy just right chill that is totally bearable to walk around in, and sleeping ..mmmm ,just right !\n\nAnd not for nothing ,but ..Saguaro's decked out in lights is simply gorgeous ! \nAnd if i ever find myself longing for a little more nip in the air or snow ...well ,that's what a ski weekend in Vail is for ....\n\nLove it !
5	"""I wanted to wander around \La Grande Orange\"""", but of course the parking lot was full. I drove around and found this treasure instead. Outside it looks like a little cottage (with cat claw climbing up one side of it! tres magnifique!) with quaint french white and blue furniture for a coffee on the patio. There actually was a table of Frenchmen doing such on my second visit! \n\nInside the tables have bright flowers in little vases. (see attached photo) Annnnnd there was a chalk elephant and monkey on the floor! Art house oils on the walls enhance the aesthetics. It just has this simple and wonderful charm. \n\nThere were whole fresh strawberries embedded in my muffin. So goooood. It had those flaky crumbles on the top too. In front of the pastries are little placards. They have descriptives like \""""elegant\"""" or \""""scrumptious\"""". The owner smiled and said his girlfriend is in PR and she's responsible for that. I thought it was beyond endearing. \n\nThe owner, in fact, is really amiable. He asked my friend and me if we'd like to see the patio. It's not ready yet for sitting... But! He plans to paint it \""""terracotta like\"""", plant some bougainvillea, buy some hotel valley ho inspired umbrellas, plus misters for the summertime. I absolutely cannot wait. \n\nOh! The Iced Toddy was pretty damn good. It had complex nutty and chocolate undertones. \n\nRight now the place is only open from 6AM-3PM. But I think it's going to blow up soon and have to extend its hours."""""""
1	"""I've been here about 100 times and seen some really good bands. The Nazi-like control that the owner, Lucky Man Productions, has on this place always ruins it for me. Pretending to be a \local indie\"""" promoter with exclusive rights to this weird dome of a music hall, they charge you and arm and a leg for everything. Ticket fees, handling fees, expensive drinks, even more expensive hot dogs and to top it off, they charge you to park there, in the dingy, hobo-centric underbelly of the 202 freeway. It's never a pleasant experience. For all it's worth, the sound in this place is just OK, but the sight lines are good for a place that holds 1,000 people."""""""
3	"""ehhhh... as a 2nd time visitor to phoenix i just gotta say i wish there more late night eateries open around 130am.\n\nthat being said, this place was ok.  sure the burger was pretty good, but damn, $11 to go?\n\nalso, i woulda thought they had a larger burger selection, but they didnt.  it was actually rather disappointing.\n\nwhat was impressive however was their beer selection.  they had like a billion beers on tap.\n\nanyway, they should rename this place \land of a 3 dozen beers & 3 types of burgers\""""... the current name is misleading!"""""""
5	After an excellent time here Sunday, it's high time I get my review of OHSO out to the people! I've been coming here since day one, and the transformation in the few short months has been outstanding. \n\nThe beers have always been excellent. Excellent selection from our local breweries here in AZ and from around the country. The food started slow....really slow. The first few times I ate here I had decided that it would just be a beer spot for me. But not lately. They have really stepped up their game and the beer brunch is incredible. $10 for a great plate of food (I prefer the steak and eggs) with a 10oz local beer on the side. Awesome. Where else can 4 people have breakfast and beers and get out of there for under $60???? NOWHERE that's where. \n\nThis weekend I was suprised by yet another improvement: The back patio. What an AMAZING SPACE! They have turned this previously un-used area into an incredible drinking environment. AND they feature a local brewery out on the patio that will rotate regularly. Owner Jon Lane is seriously stepping up the involvement of the craft brewing industry and has his location poised to become the mecca of local beer. I sat in the sun, drank my Sonoran IPA, and revelled at how great a space and drinking locale OHSO has become. Just fantastic.\n\nSometime soon OHSO will begin brewing their own beer and that's when this place will start to deserve a 6th star. Can't wait! OHSO is my favorite for beer and I will continue to come back here time after time.
2	"""The place is a gothgasm. \nAmazing decor.\nBut I won't  be hypnotized enough to not see the shortcomings.\n\nIndustrial music on Wed, Goth and Industrial Fridays, Saturday has various, and BLACK MASS (solid Goth) once a month. \nNice bathrooms and decor. \n$5 cover on Fridays.\nSaturday beat the cover before 10pm, $3 piss beers n wells.\nWed.

Cool people out front."""""""
4	"""If you know anything about the smoker lifestyle, you will get a kick out of this place.\n\nTo start, the sizes of the sandwiches aren't simply listed in inches, but have a (strictly coincidental) name to identify them:\nNugs (4'), Pinners (8\), Blunts (12\"""").\n\nThe entertaining names don't stop there; here are a few of the sandwich names:\n\nKush\nSilver Haze\nAfghani\nPanama Red\n\nThis being our first visit, I went with the Afghani (thinly sliced spicy turkey breast, jalape\u00f1os & pepper jack cheese).  To mine I added black olives, lettuce, spicy mustard, and a little mayo; all on wheat bread (other options are garlic and white).  I got the Blunt, and it was more than enough to fill me up for what I feel was a reasonable price (under $10 if I remember correctly).\n\nThe bread and meat were very fresh.  The toppings were kept at according temps (olives cool, condiments just cooler than room temp, lettuce not soggy).  Overall a very pleasant experience.  Lastly, the first place I have been to in the Valley that gives me a chance to get a fountain Wild Cherry Pepsi.\n\nThe staff was friendly, entertaining \""""stoner\"""" art (check out the Garden of Weeden mural), I would visit this place again."""""""
3	I am so friggin' spoiled by living in the Bay Area that its sickening.\n\nThis place, in AZ, is probably a 4-5 star place if you live here and that's all you know.   Unfortunately for Modern Steak, I do not live here (thank G O D), and I know what is out there.\n\nThe atmosphere was slightly less shiny-shirt douchebaggy than Mastro's and the decor made me feel like I was in a mall...oh that's right, I was in a mall.  I cannot say anything bad about the wait staff because our waiter was awesome, he was attentive and gave me a great wine recommendation for both an appetizer and the main course (had the same wine as Gabi after reading her review...).\n\nFirst off, if you decide to go here even after reading my review get the lobster chowder - the reason I thought I was in for an epic meal was that when I got this thing it had HUGE chunks of lobster and bacon.   The taste was phenomenal, great job on that.   I thought I was seriously in for it after having devoured that as an appetizer.\n\nThe steak, a $50 ribeye, was forgettable at best.   I have made $12 filets from Costco at home that I remember vividly.   For $50, this thing should have slammed me into a steak coma from kicking my ass with awesomeness.   It didn't, it disappointed.  \n\nThe sides were just meh, we tried the pureed potatos and the Mac and Cheese.   \n\nTo sum it up, if you have $200 to spare and want to throw it away on a decent but forgettable meal with great service - you found your place.
3	My girlfriend and I purchased the Travelzoo with lunch . I live down the street and frequent many spas but had not yet had the pleasure of using the spa at the Westin. We arrived this past Sunday and were a little disappointed in this spa. We arrived and when we checked in they wanted to know at that time when we wanted to eat and where. The where was either outside by the pool in 115 plus degree temp or in the shade in 115 degrees. The other choice was 1 table inside their retail area. This was odd as we did not want to eat outside and when it was time for us to eat, someone was using the lone table and they ended up bringing in a table from outside for us. They did not even try to wipe it down and it was obviously dirty. This all happened before our services. We were suddenly not as excited about our spa day and I think it effected my opinion of the massage. During most massages that I have received, my feet ,hands and scalp are all massaged. None of these areas was touched and  while the rest of the massage was ok. It only lasted 45 minutes. The price of the travelzoo was comparable to most others and i will not be back.
5	Whatever you do, DO NOT under any circumstances try BOBA TEA.  You will instantly become addicted and then end up craving it like a pregnant lady craves mud and pickles.  Pregnant ladies are weird.  \nFor the uninitiated,  Boba Tea is various types of teas, slushes or milk drinks that you can have them put these little tapioca balls into.  They are about the size of a pea and they taste kinda sweet and are chewy.  They serve two purposes as far as I can tell.  To shoot up your straw at light speed and cause you to foolishly choke in front of your hot lady date or to turn the boring ho-hum activity of drinking into a fun filled game of hide and go seek with your straw.  \nNow I usually get one of two drinks, the Black Honey Tea with boba or the Ginger Milk drink with boba as well.  Both are awesome in their own respect.  The Black tea is very light and thirst quenching and the Ginger Milk is creamy, sweet with the throat burning effects only ginger can give.  \nMy only complaint, and this is solely directed at my own inability to jam that straw through the top of the cup.  I am instantly transported back to the days of youth soccer wherein I was the only kid too stupid to jam that straw through the top of a caprisun.  At least this time I don't share my shame with a bunch of jocks but instead get snickered at by the Asians as I jam that silly large straw through the top and splash tea all over my school clothes.
5	Let me just throw this out there right now. Being that this is my first review I just want to let you know that I do not intend to score easy on restaurants, this just happens to be a favorite of mine. So here it goes....\n\nEver have a day that just seems gloomy, depressing, boring, unfulfilled. Well, the common cure I have found isn't at the pharmacist or the doctor. No, the cure I found happened to be just around the corner at a little pizzeria called, well, pizzeria. This magnificent little joint is attached to the hip of what is known as La Grande Orange grocer. I have to say nothing brings a smile to my face faster than fresh shrimp ceviche followed by sweet corn pizza with sourdough crust and a pitcher of house made white sangria. My wife and I frequent this establishment and have never once left with bad taste. Service has always been exceptional even when the place is slammed with customers. I warn you though, eat all you want but do save room for a slice of peanut butter pie. \nI believe the only thing that I've ever had problems with is some of the rude customers, but it's typical behavior of the residents of the area.
5	The name is so misleading, because this is the most charming dining spot I've ever eaten! \n\nI dined here for lunch with a friend and was blown away by everything about it. First, it's location is tucked away near ASU campus in a quiet little neighborhood. It appears to be a converted home built in the early 1900's and lots of beautiful mature trees and plants growing in their huge, and I mean huge outdoor patio area. I only dined outside, but honestly with such beautiful weather 9 months out of the year here, why would you dine any other way! \n\nThe service was excellent! The staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while I drank water and waited a while for my friend. The menu was amazing. I never once read a menu that I wanted to try everything on here. They had a huge variety of dishes at what I can only describe as American/French fusion. It all looked so divine. And from what I've been told, their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes. So I can't wait to see what they offer when I return. I went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche, fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup. The soup was so rich and creamy, I could have ordered and ate a whole trough! It was that good. The fruit was clean, well portioned and fresh. I'm very particular with fruit, and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened. And the quiche was heavenly as well. Just the right amount of ham and tomatoes with alot of flavor.\n\nSince I was here for lunch only, the prices were reasonable. I've heard at dinner it can get expensive.\n\nThis was an unforgettable dining experience and recommend this to everyone to try at least once.
4	I'm a fan of Vietnamese food and am happy to have a modern new Vietnamese restaurant downtown. I went for lunch and had the Mi Quang (Quang-Nam noodles with shrimp and vegies) and Gon Cuon (Vietnamese spring rolls). The noodle dish was good--very fresh tasting and was made even better with the addition of some Siracha sauce. The spring rolls and dipping sauce were delicious as served. The food was reasonably priced for a sit down restaurant. The service was efficient and friendly. I will definitely return for a workday lunch--there were a number of dishes served to people sitting near me that looked and smelled yummy.
3	"""If I was going to review the view, then I would give it 5 stars (though driving up to the view almost made  sick with fear....)\nI met my friends for dinner on Friday night...there were 8 of us, but the service was extremely strange to me and there were a few mishaps that I felt need to be addressed.  While I thought it was strange that the waiter - who I am tending to believe had some weird social skills - took the order of the ladies first and then the men.  He was gracious enough to ask us if we wanted our bill split by couple.  But when he was taking our order, I knew that he also may have had ADD issues. It took forever for us to order (The waiter said he thought we were still looking because some of us had the menu open...)  My friend next to me ordered the scallops and a side of gnocchi. He asked her if she wanted to start of with a soup or salad.  When he took my order, I said the Halibut.  Did he ask me for a starter?  Nope...he said \Wonderful...make I take your order?\"""" (To my friend's husband)  \n\nI wish that I did order a bowl of the lobster bisque.  I was able to try that and it was amazing.  Our entrees were delicious as well.  My friend's short rib (I also go to try) was cooked to perfection.  I heard great things about the lobster and the chicken.  My friends did tell me that the rice was a little undercooked and the gnocchi was a little heavy.\n\nNow I wish I could tell you that my dinner was amazing.  I was enjoying the halibut with shrimp, asparagus and purple mashed potatoes.  I finished the shrimp and still had most of my halibut and mashed potatoes when I set my fork down to look at my phone.  (My fault I guess...)  Because the next thing I noticed, a server took my plate away.  There was no \""""Are you finished?\"""" or \""""Would you like to take this to go?\""""  Nothing...just took my plate away.  I noticed that he stacked my plate, so there was no way to retrieve my food.  My friends were finished with their dishes....so when I said \""""I am sorry, but you took my plate away and I wasn't done\"""", the waiter said that he was sorry and was about to go back to retrieve it.  I told him that I didn't want it now, so he did offer to have the chef make me a new one. (NO!) or if he could refill my drink.  (I was driving, so NO!) I would have thought that I would have gotten a complimentary dessert but I didn't.  I was being treated for this dinner, but still,  the dinner wasn't even comped or had a percentage taken off. \n\nI would love to try this place again since the food and view were great.  I would just hope that my service next time would be better."""""""
3	I want to give them more stars but just can't . I will eat there again and re-review. Here is the story, It was the day after xmas for lunch, they were crowded and it looked like most of the wait staff was either off or missed work. The poor waitress did her best and tried to explain the menu in a rush(she did well, considering), but just too many people to cover all the tables she was given.  Guacamole is great, homemade chips too.  I had brisket sandwich which was good But my girlfriends dish which was supposed to be drizzled in vinegar was soaked, so it tasted very bad.  Place has tons of potential, interesting menu, great atmosphere but just needs a little help.
5	This was a fantastic buffet and my mom really enjoyed her birthday brunch.  We had crab legs, oysters, shrimp, caviar, lamb, prime rib, antipasti, fresh salads, smoked meats, I could go on and on (and I did)!  I ate so much I nearly had to pass up the huge dessert bar, but managed to have a few cream puffs and some cheesecake :)  Plus, kids under 5 eat free so when you consider my mom, my son, and I all ate for around $60 it was very reasonable.  \n\nI am pretty sure we will go back for a gluttonous Easter feast on the patio.  They have fantastic views, too!
4	I admit it... \nIt was me who convinced Sarah P and Jared M to accompany me to Mojo last night after the OYE at La Bocca.  I used the excuse that Sarah really needed to try it, but honestly, I selfishly just wanted it - I didn't care too much about Sarah trying it or Jared getting it either.  We walked the 4 blocks to get our fro-yo from Mojo (me in heels no less), and it was totally worth it.\n\nI mixed up a big cup of original tart, pomegranate tart, and passion fruit flavors with melon mochi and yogurt chips.  The only negative is that the melon mochi is not as delightful as the original (plain) flavored mochi.  Other than that, I was happy as a clam.  Friendly service, clean topping bar, and the total for all four cups (we brought a cup back for Julian) was $16.  (Yes, it was on the pricier side, but it was worth it).\n\nNow I'm off to make time in my day to get to the gym to burn off the wine, pizza, and fro-yo that was consumed last night, and I'll soon start that damn wedding diet (again)!
3	The Habit has yet to become a habit with me. I have come here a few times when visiting Phoenix, and while I have enjoyed the mushroom Swiss charburger and love their onion rings (their fries are okay), I have yet to feel drawn enough to make this place a regular destination. I do have one general question about the new gourmet burger fad: if you make a burger so large and stuff it with so many different things that you cannot fit it into your mouth, is it still a burger (given that a burger is supposedly a type of sandwich)? Still, their charburgers are good and served at a good price, and I do aim to come here one day to check out their veggie burger, as I like to encourage restaurants to offer some type of veggie burger option.
3	I had not expected anything fabulous.  It is what it is.  Cheap, not steller, food.  But quick and kinda cool that you can choose whatever you like and then YOU don't have to go back for more, your wait person will do it for you.  You just ttell them what you want and they will get it.  So if all you like here are tacos....just gorge yourself on tacos!  It's really not a bad  deal and if you have a family with teenagers who want to eat everything in site...well, here is the place for you!  The place was clean although I did not use the restroom so I can't comment on that.  \n\nI spoke with the manager as we were leaving and he was very personable and seemed open to constructive critisism.  Apparently he just took over.  So, if you go knowing this is not going to be the best mexican food in town, then it's fine.  Not a bad value.  \n\nThanks Panchos.
4	Thank you Arizona for providing me with some good sushi! It's a busy place since it's located in a huge shopping plaza but it was worth it. I was so pleased with the quality of fish, the flavor and texture of the rice and their prices are reasonable. Service was great...our sush took longer than the combo meal to come out but our server Jaime was visibly upset by this and so apologetic. No problem though because the food was worth the wait. Bonus points for the mango iced tea! Will definitely go back for our sushi fix when in AZ.
1	I eat out a lot and I truly love Italian food.  Daniel's is on the high end on costs....and I can say honestly, it's simply not worth it.  We had three meals among us....and not a single one was good.  The place is stuffy and I found the wait staff to be old and not particularly friendly or customer service oriented.\n\nI rank Daniel's at the bottom of Italian and I don't recommend it.  Avoid this one for better options\n\nI read Yelp a lot...so I only provide honest feedback based on my opinion
3	First, I am reviewing the restaurant inside not the grocery store. This was the Fifth place that I tried in my taco quest. The tacos were okay, again nothing great, and again had the carne asada, marinated pork and this time a carnitas too. The prices are more reasonable, and my expectations were lowered, but actually a lot better than a few places especial los flavitos. I would give their tacos a 2 star but what kick them to three was the drinks. They are freshly made, well I had them early around 10:30 and also one time at 7:00 so they were awesome. Pineapple actually had pineapple chunks in the drink, can you imagine that. Horchata and melon were actually thick and not watered down, can even feel the texture. I actually went here twice, one time for breakfast because of the drinks. Their breakfast burrito is huge and not bad.
5	In late March my dad and I went to spring training and we stayed at a nice hotel nearby. We passed by the place on Sunday evening on our way to the hotel and it looked different than something we'd find in San Diego. Later that night we go and sit at the bar. The bartender greeted us right away and offered us drinks right on the spot. No wait at all. The cool part about the place is it's informal. Customers can eat peanuts and just drop them on the floor. Even the workers were wearing sports wear. That's how cool it was. \n\nThe food was quickly served and delicious. We spent under $25 both times visiting in the 4 days being there. Next spring training were definitely going back.
4	I appreciate how this place is the kind of neighborhood joint where half the people visiting seem to be regulars.  Always a great sign and makes the place a fun place to be.  A rarity in pre-fab suburban boring Surprise.  The lunch specials were good deals price wise!  Dinner seemed a little more expensive, but I've only been for lunch.\n\nIf I still lived in Surprise, I'd visit again- simply because I really enjoyed the people who worked there and how cool they were.
5	Although I haven't had the opportunity to try out the famous Karaoke rooms I have definitely enjoyed happy hour here and I have to say that it is Amazing! Its definitely going to be a spot of mine for a while. I took my parents and hubby with me yesterday to check it out because Ive heard great things about their Happy Hour.\n\nMy husband and I had two martinis each along with sliders and fries, friend rice and chicken tempura. My parents had sushi and it was pretty awesome as well. Our bill for the two of us was only $30 and we were so full that we didn't need dinner. I cant wait to go back!\nIm currently recruiting for a karaoke session!
5	I've been in here like a million times to raid the counter at Petit Fromage, but I had never actually tried any of the offerings from D'Licious Dishes.  Finally, the husband and I had way too busy of a schedule to go out to eat or to even make dinner at home so I picked up a piece of sausage lasagna and some garlic mashed potatoes here.\n\nOnce I got home and reheated my food I nestled up on the couch to eat and watch Judge Judy.  I was not prepared for how delicious my food was going to be!  The garlic mashed potatoes were beyond perfect.  They were smooth and creamy but with some chunky pieces every now and then.  The garlic flavor was perfectly balanced.  You could definitely taste it, but you weren't tasting it hours later.  The lasagna was exceptional as well.  It was also really big for a really fair price, 7 bucks I think.  The noodles were a perfect al dente, the tomato sauce was fresh and robust, the ricotta was yummy, and the sausage had a great kick to it.  I have nothing bad to say about this place!  Plus, they share space with my new obsession, so how can I go wrong?
1	"""I do not recommend this practice. The staff seems friendly and helpful however the \bed side manner\"""" of Dr. Leonard in unacceptable. He refused to speak to me about more than one subject per office visit (even though all was related to one greater issue) and required me to schedule additional appointments just to talk about blood work results. These results should have been explained in detail, instead he rushed through them because that was not part of the \""""well woman\"""" appointment. Scheduling appointments has been a constant struggle due to the restrictions placed on what you are allowed to talk about in each appointment. I would not recommend this practice to anyone."""""""
2	Big kudos for serving breakfast late in Scottsdale (unlike, ahem, the Orange Table, which stops the pancakes before 10 a.m.). But would I go back? Only for the pomegranate smoothie. \n\nOtherwise, it was pretty bland stuff. Ironically, the menu looks uber creative, but the execution? Not so much. Case in point: the ballyhooed cinnamon challah french toast was dried out and had no custardy center at all, plus the side of scrambled eggs was also extremely dry. \n\nServers were OK, though seemed very not thrilled to be there. In the end, that's a fair attitude, I guess, since neither were we.
4	"""First off, glad to see someone move into the Gold Spot building!! Got my husband to come and try Pita Jungle, even though he says no the Greek food.... The building is done up nicely, with a great outdoor patio area. The beers on draft are first rate, and the happy hour tapas menu (all for $1 !!) is great for chatting and sharing. \nWe ordered wayyyy too much, as the plates are very large. We shared the Greek salad, fresh and tasty. Husband had the Phillie Pita... huge, and hot, tasty and given a good review by him, with a \I could do this again\"""". I had the Tuna Pita. It was great, but I thought it was tuna in a pita, and it was greens with tuna on top with a pita on the side. Was great, but huge!! Then we shared two of the one dollar tapas plates, the falafal and the hummus trio. Both good... \nService was wonderful, and the whole experience was good. Glad to have them in the hood, a new place to ride our bikes or scooters to!!"""""""
4	I had the honor of hanging out with three lovely ladies after stopping at Filmbar for a happy hour. We were STARVING so I looked up restaurants close by and The Arrogant Butcher was agreed on by all parties. After wandering aimlessly for parking (damn you Phoenix Suns for having a game) I was able to secure a parking spot and sashayed on over for some eats. \n\nWe were greeted and seated immediately. The decor I must say is very different but nice. I was fascinated by their lamp shades. ( I know silly but hey I was) We started out with the crusty bread and olive oil however we had no plates, but we dug in anyway (an let me just say this was some damn good bread) Our waitress was like hmm would you guys like some plates for your bread? Hmm yes please ( ya think) lol  We all ordered something different from the sweet potato tortelli, yum, the turkey sloppy joe, which had a slight kick but not as spicy as you would think, fish and chips, and of course my dish which was black mussels with pommes frites. OMG! My dish was actually on the appetizer menu and let me just say I was in heaven when my dish arrived. It had the most mussels I have have ever had and the fries were just perfect. There were even bits of pork shoulder as well as cloves of garlic throughout the dish. Sweet baby jesus. Now mind you I was full, but I ate every last bit as it was not like I could take any left overs home. I liked it so much that I am contemplating going back ASAP just to have some more, so yes it was that good. A word to the wise, if you order a side of chicken let it be known that it will be a small portion for $4.00. A very small portion. (that is all)\n\nThe service was good, the company was freaking fabulous and the food was divine. They even validate parking (thank goodness) so it made it all the better. An all around win in my book.
3	We went there for an extended happy hour last week, and the most memorable thing about it (besides our wit and humor) was the service.  Or should I say lack of service?  Others around the table left some tips, but some left none at all.   When my napkin fell on the floor, it took about 20 minutes to get a fresh one and when she took my debit card, it took about 20 minutes to get it back so we could leave, etc. etc. etc.  Not good service, bottom line.\n\nFood and drinks were average.  Certainly nothing to write home about.  I had the fish and chips, but it took 15 minutes to get the malt vinegar to go with them.  The fish and chips were good; the chips were especially good and others around the table were stealing my crispy-on-the-outside-fluffy-on-the-inside steak fries.  They were mighty good, but the fish was just good.  Others said that food was fine, but not spectacular.  Oh, and the coleslaw that come with the fish and chips was beyond bland.  \n\nDecent prices, but probably not a place I'll suggest to go back to.
4	Richardson's has great, unique food, and definitely a fun vibe. I am excited to go again. \n\nI think it's important to note that it is a bit dark, cramped and loud at times. This would not normally be a problem, but I went with my grandparents and this was a bit of a problem, because it was very difficult to see the menu and steps in the restaurant, and hear each other. \n\nI'd recommend this place more for an outing with friends, to grab dinner and drinks, and less of a quiet family dinner kind of place.
5	Friends in CA call Whole Foods, Whole Paycheck and now I know why.  The Scottsdale store at the 101 is huge with all kinds of culinary temptations.  \n\nI filled the bottom of my Yelp recycling bag with 1) single salmon corn cake, 2) small piece smoked black cod, 3) small piece smoked salmon candy, 4) medium piece smoked chipotle salmon, 5) tiny piece smoked king salmon, 6) small wedge languiole - raw milk cheese and 7) small chunk emmi cabe aged emmentalker cheese.  The total came to $XXXV making the average price $V.  Not too bad considering the fish will last maybe two days, three tops.  The cheese becomes part of a scalloped potatoes dish for a delayed Easter dinner.\n\nI had had some delicious smoked cod and candy salmon on Easter Sunday with relatives in Pasadena and learned the fish came from the Pasadena Whole Foods. I took some leftovers across the desert in my ice chest and the fish was just as I had remembered it from the day before. \n\nWith the taste buds panting for more I googled Whole Foods and assumed the Paradise Valley store would be the most logical choice for in-store smoked fish.  WRONG, the fish counter person there told me the only stores with a smoker are 1) Chandler and 2) Scottsdale at the 101.  The Scottsdale store was closer so that was how I ended up there.\n\nI had a great time chatting with the Whole Foods fish counter person.  He had set-up the Pasadena smoker and now smoked the fish in Scottsdale.  He (native American, I think) was a wealth of information on smoked fish and the various types.  I asked about the smoked salmon candy and he explained  the natives in AK add sugar to get their kids to eat salmon when they are young.   As an aside my kids, Holly T and Mike T wouldn't eat any fish as kids but as adults now eat salmon but not as much as me.  The candy salmon comes directly from natives in AK whereas the rest of the fish is smoked in the store.  He then went on to discuss the various salmon runs in AK and how Whole Foods supports sustainable fisheries.  All very cool and informative.\n\nYou can bet I will be back in a few weeks (or sooner for smoked fish) when fresh wild salmon becomes available.
5	Just checked out the Arrogant Butcher this evening with the boyfriend. The place was surprisingly crowded- a very good sign. We were seated very promptly, and our waiter was very quick to come up and talk to us about the restaurant and the food.\n\nWe would up getting the pretzel bread fondue for an appetizer. The boyfriend got fish and chips, and I got the short rib stew.\n\nThe fondue was GREAT. It was a last minute buy- I saw another table that had it and got it on impulse. Best impulse of the night. The bread bites were warm, soft and fluffy, and the fondue light and savory. The two of us polished off the rather large bowl with more ease than our waistlines would probably like. \n\nHis fish and chips were good. They weren't out of this world, but very decent nonetheless. The fish was melty and flaky, the batter crisp and not too thick. The fries were just fries, but were also crispy and warm. They were the best thing to dunk into my stew gravy.\n\nMy short rib stew was AMAZING. It was a bowl of short rib stew in a savory, chile and pepper sauce with a sunny side egg on the top. A piece of cornbread came along with it. The spiciness of the stew was perfect- savory and with a kick, but not to the point where I was crying. The cornbread was sweet, but savory too, from what I could gather was lashings of melted butter on top. The friend egg made it out of this world.\n\nI got a cocktail that the waiter recommended- can't remember what it was named, but it was vodka, lime and muddled raspberries and very clean and refreshing. Quite enjoyable.\n\nBut what took the restaurant from 4 to 5 stars was the service. We were unfortunately seated behind a group of very rowdy patrons. They were noisy, vulgar, and had the unfortunate tendency to slam on the table very loudly. But we're city folks, and I live in the hood. You tune this stuff out, and it really didn't bother my boyfriend or myself too much.\n\nI liked that our waiter apologized to us for it. It was annoying, but we assured him all was well. However, when we were walking out the restaurant manager himself apologized about it, gave us his card and told him to ask for him the next time we went there, to make sure he could go out of his way to make up for this experience. I didn't think the experience was dampened THAT much by those a-holes, but I was extremely impressed by the effort made by both him and the waiter. It shows Fox's commitment to making sure that their patrons are taken care of. And that's really awesome. \n\nDefinitely go check them out.
4	Maui Dogs is great if you're looking for a dog that's a little out of the ordinary. Get the Hawaiian toppings, and both the polish sausage and bratwurst are good, I don't think I've had a regular beef dog.\n\nThis is one of the two places with good dogs I frequent that are like a block away from me. I go here if I want something unique, they go for a mix of sweet and spice here, and it works. I recommend the sweet and spicy dog, the sunset dog, and the spam sliders Maui style. Whatever I get I usually make it a meal with tots and either red cream soda or green tea.\n\nOn my visit today they were giving away free samples of chicken wings with every meal. I liked the crispness of the skin, and once again the sauce was a nice mix of sweet and spicy. If (when) I order them in the future I'm going to ask for extra sauce though. The only thing I've had here that I wouldn't get again is a burger with chili on it. The thin chili is fine on a dog you're going to eat with a fork, not as much in a burger. Thankfully the cook was nice enough to suggest that I should get the chili on the side if I was ordering to go, so I still got home with decent food and not a soggy mess.
5	Sadly I'm going to rate this restaurant based on my recollection of Homemade Ginger Ale and Fried Cheese Curds... maybe I should stop now... Hmm.  \n\nLocation, Food, Ambience - neat little place.  I eat at plenty of places but rarely two months later can a recall anything specifically about the experience, but Tuck Shop had fried cheese curds... really good fried cheese curds - I was in Wisconsin for a while so I've had my share, and these were probably the best I've had - usually you just end up with a fried cheese stick but here they did the cheese curd justice - and then you get some tasty home brewed ginger ale to wash it down...\n\nYeah, Ginger Ale and Fried Cheese Curds...  Hmm, I probably shouldn't have written this...
5	"""Holy CRAP was this place packed today!! It's gotten astronomically popular since it arrived in this location about two or three years ago, and despite being a decent-sized establishment, if you arrive dead on at midday you're in for at least a five to ten min wait unless you're lucky. Just like I wrote in my review of Vogue Bistro, I felt like I wasn't dressed appropriately, although this time it was because while I was wearing brown camo cargo pants and a grey t-shirt, seemingly everyone else there - both typical patrons and servers alike - were dressed like they were starring in a Wiggles on-stage production. I'm a big fan of the Chicken Tikka Masala, which I've been ordering ever since it was an experiment listed on a sheet of A4 paper attached to the main menu; it's now a regular item. I also get the caramelized cauliflower with tahini which is utterly delicious. I'm NOT a big fan of cheap, sh1tty tattoos though, and I saw a whole stack of those too.\n\nToday was more or less a day like any other. Met the wife here, sat down, were promptly served our food. I went for the lavosh shawarma wrap instead of my usual since I'm trying to cut down on carbs (a very slight cutdown.. whatever!) but did get the cauliflower too. The cauli was different today. For a start, they brought it out on a full-sized plate, whereas it's normally served on a side-item-sized plate. Was fine with me as the wife usually shares it. While the lavosh wrap was absolutely delicious as I remember it being, the tahini sauce that went along with the cauli was weirdly sweet. Like it had sugar or syrup mixed in with it. Usually it's a more tan color and savoury, but this time it was more on the amber/orange side. When the server passed by I asked him whether the recipe had officially changed - he said no, and that they might have overdone one of the ingredients in the kitchen, but he definitely noticed the difference in color too. I said I was asking because I wouldn't order it again if it tasted the same, but I'm a big fan of the usual sauce. He said he'd check with the kitchen.\n\nNot more than a couple of minutes later he comes back carrying a giant dessert plate with a slice of duo-tone baklava on it, covered in giant sultanas (aka golden raisins, I believe) and dusted in cinnamon powder by way of compensation. Jesus on a pogo stick. Chevy Chase could have tobogganed down a snowy hill on the bastard. It was delicious - I shouldn't have eaten it but I did. Even the wife, who isn't a big fan of baklava, took a couple of bites and proclaimed that it was the best baklava she had ever had. Very nice of them to do this, especially being so busy. Double-size side item plate and a comped dessert for two - you folk in Liberia are sure missing out! Definitely coming back (I would have anyway, I had no major problem with the meal).\n\nI thoroughly recommend this place, it's a great all-round location if you want reasonably healthy macrobiotic stuff in a funky kind of atmosphere, long as you don't mind some of the saddest tattoos you'll probably ever see. They thoroughly deserve their high rating and a Yelp ambassador should consider giving them one of those \People love us on Yelp!\"""" stickers that are inexplicably given to other places such as Mr Goodcents. Although, if you want proper fresh Greek, Greek Wraps just up the road trumps them. I'd rock up there for a chicken kabob wrap on their freshly baked pita any day of the week. And no, owner of Chicago Gyros, they didn't pay me to say that. BTW, Greek Wraps did a giant renovation around Christmas last year, the place is almost literally three times bigger. Now if only Haji Baba's would renovate that rancid cesspit they call a restroom.."""""""
4	This is an awesome breakfast spot.  Never have a problem getting a table-usually opt for the bar tables.  The veggie omelets are great and loooove the rosemary potatoes.  They are not the ordinary breakfast potatoes that everyone else serves.  The eggs bene may be in my top 3 for best bene EVER!  Also great breakfast burritos!\n\nFull bar is a great plus but was disappointed by the bloody mary.  The mix may have been bad.  All in all love this place!!  Ask for specials not on the menu-the ribeye steak and eggs was a great quality meal for the price (12 or 13 bucks). \n\n The guy server that makes the foil roses is one of the best servers.  In fact all the male servers have always provided great service-unfortunately not so much with the female servers i've had.  The last time it was a girl and she was nice but very unattentive.
5	We heard about this place during the 2010 AZ Resturant week. We wanted to go but didn't make it. Fast Forward to 2011 AZ Resturant week....we made it! after a year of thinking about this place and finally making it, we LOVED the experience. \nThe food was amazing (minus Frois Gross which is just not for me). We will be back and are just waiting for the right time. It is a little pricey but the food, experience and service is worth it.
5	I think a common misconception about Trader Joe's is that it's a really expensive specialty grocery store, but that just isn't true.  They actually have really great prices and an awesome selection of organic, healthy and imported food items that you just can't find anywhere else.  \nThey have the best hummus and the flavors range from original to a blend of kalamata and black olives (my favorite). They have a good selection of Morningstar Farm products (for vegetarians) and they're cheaper here than you'll find at a grocery store.  They also have their own line of similar products in the frozen food aisle.  \nTheir wine selection is great and they have a little floral area that has beautiful and inexpensive arrangements.  Just try to get there during off-hours of the day or you'll be battling long lines. Trader Joe's is pretty small- and pretty popular!
1	No stars!\n\nMy wife and I were looking for something different in Glendale \\ Peoria area.  Lots of the usual chains here, and since we had never been in Firebirds, we might as well try it.  Mistake\n\nIt wasn't that busy and we were told by the door holder (can't call her a hostess since she was no host) said to sit anywhere.  We waited 15 minutes just to get the waitress to come take drink orders.  Not a good start.\n\nOur Queso with Chips was cold when it came out.  Our meals were bland, greasy bar food.  My ribs tasted like they were bought from Safeway.  And service continued to be ridiculously poor.\n\nYelp makes me give it a star, which it doesn't deserve.  Spending $60 for dinner for 2 and having it be this bad an experience deserves no stars  \n\nDo not waste your time at this poor excuse for a sports bar.  There are many better choices.
5	This is one of my favorite casual dining experiences and is easily becoming my go-to place.  The service here is exceptional especially in the bar. AJ will take care of you! Tuesday is half priced tequila all day long which is a tremendous value for happy hour along with discounted Beer/Wine and appetizers.  I have a tie for my two favorite entrees...I first tried Black Chile at the Taste of Biltmore 2011, where I experienced their Chicken Enchiladas with spicy roasted Green poblano cream sauce and I am still a rabid foodie fan!...Delish with a side of vegan black beans and sticky rice....but if you are feeling like lighter fare, I highly recommend the Salmon Salad with chayote squash and avocado (dressing on the side because although addictive it is a quite heavy creamy sesame, for me I think this salad would compliment well with a sesame ginger vinaigrette) .. I tend to customize my orders and the kitchen & staff have always been accommodating and courteous. Not too mention they get it Right!!  Their frozen house margarita with Chambord stomps all over Z-tejas's!
5	Went here for a date last week and I really liked it!  The hostess greeted us right away and took us to our table.  I don't know if she could tell we were on a date or what but she gave us a great corner booth that was a little secluded which was nice.\n\nThe waitress came out right away and had a thick Italian accent (always a really good sign when you're at an Italian restaurant!).  She made recommendations and knew how the food was cooked when asked.  I decided to go with the Chicken Parmesan (I know it's not that creative but I love it!) and my date got the Chicken Marsala.  Both were great.  Our plates were cleared when we left.  Before the meal you get salad and crispy garlic bread both of which were also yummy.  Also my water glass never got empty which, to me, is the true test of how good a restaurant's service is.  I'll definitely be returning!
5	Left a message for Stacy who called back very promptly.  She and Dr. Pehoushek were able to fit my son in same day to remove a jawline cyst.  Another dermatologist had suggested a plastic surgeon due to proximity to nerves.  Dr. Pehoushek had no such concerns and quickly and thoroughly removed the cyst.  He was professional and personable!  My son has other cysts and will not hesitate to go back for his treatment.  Since I have a Yelp account he asked me to write the highest recommendation for him.
4	When hubby and I first landed in Mesa, we were had a fierce craving for Indian food. We pulled up google and did a search which led us to Royal Taj.\n\nWe had literally been in Mesa for a few days and were used to Indian food in Britain. We found this place ok, but not as flavorful as we would have liked.\n\n...Two Years Later...\n\nAfter lacklustre Indian food and mindbendingly tasteless curries from different places, I decided to give this place one more try. It's also ten minutes away from my house.\n\nI will have to change my mind about this place - the curry is wonderful and their tandoori chicken is just barely made on this side of heaven.\n\nI will recommend Royal Taj to anyone who wants good Indian food.\n\nThis is my favorite Indian place - until I find a new one.  :D
5	Love love love this place - the only bad thing is they have 1 location -\nI drive all the way from N Scottsdale to downtown Phoenix for their fresh deli sandwiches.  I always get the poor boy with everyhting...they always put the right amount of dressing and veggies and of course fresh meats - it's huge ! so come here with a big appetite - one of the truly REAL New York style subs...going to get one right now ;)
2	We sat outside patio. Waited 10 minutes for service. Then waited 10 minutes to get my beer. Wings came no ranch. When asked again waited. I assumed was the manager in blue button up long sleeve shirt asked how our service was. After telling him how bad service was he made the excuse that waiter had too many tables. Don't see how that is a good reason for our bad service.  \nUpon leaving manager in blue shirt looked at us but never said bye. Even appeared to be bad mouthing.. This was my worst Buffalo Wild Wings experience. . Thx yelp!
1	"""Returned for a second visit with my wife and found the place was fairly crowded. It was a weekend, so I figured that was to be expected. We put our names on the list with the three people working the seating at the counter, then sat down within a few feet of them and began our wait. \n\nFifteen minutes later, they call our name, party of two. I go up there immediately to find them escorting two elderly people away, following the guy who had called our name. Those elderly people had just walked in and hadn't even put their names on the list yet. I asked the other two at the counter what the third gentleman was doing, taking those people to our table when they called out our name. \n\nSo the guy returns from seating them and tells us, \Oh they said they were you,\"""" as his excuse. I overheard the whole exchange and never once did they say they were us. What really happened was that they happened to be standing there, he assumed they were the party of two he was supposed to be seating and he said, \""""Right this way folks!\"""" and they followed him to (what should have been) our table. \n\nNevertheless, confronted with this, the coward continued to put the blame for his idiotic mistake squarely on the shoulders of the innocent elderly couple who didn't even know what had happened. This was some high school kid with the wanna-be goth / emo thing going on, jet black hair and some kind of ridiculous black earring 'thing' dangling out of his left ear. Yeah, really classy having this guy scapegoat a couple in their 80s because he wasn't man enough to admit he screwed up and simply took the first warm bodies he could find to the table.\n\nThe staff doing the seating did nothing for us. No call to the manager, no offer to compensate us for having to wait for another table after their mistake. \""""Oh, you can have the next one, just go back to waiting.\"""" No sincere apology, especially not from the emo coward, who scurried away as quick as he could, leaving the two girls to speak with the angry customers themselves. \n\nI informed them that I wasn't going to wait again and was taking my business somewhere else where they don't give away my table to what is obviously the wrong party. All three of them saw my wife and I, knew which party we were and they knew those people who just walked up to the counter were not us, they hadn't even put their name on the list yet. I can understand if one of them wasn't paying attention, but all three of them? If you cannot have three people properly taking customers from point A to point B, I'm sorry but you have an issue. \n\nI later called and chewed out the manager as well as telling him who was involved and how they cowardly pinned the fault on the elderly people. He assured me corrective action would be taken, but still defended emo-kid. \n\nThe last straw was when he told me that next time I should ask for a manager when I arrive, so he can make sure I'm treated properly on the next visit. I told him I shouldn't have to fetch a manager to make sure that a customer is treated properly, that should happen regardless. Apparently he hadn't figured that out before I told him. \n\nI won't be returning to this place if that's how you treat people and how clueless the management is. Giving away tables, blaming the elderly and no involvement from the manager? Talk about three strikes."""""""
2	I have been here way too many times but I am officially done giving them chances. So frustrating that this place doesn't step it up! It is pretty much an overpriced bar. They have a large selection of just mediocre bar food. I love the concept and it's tons of fun for kids. But I can't bring myself to go here again because I can't bare the food. They have no healthy options on their kids menu and it's not much better on the regular menu. I consider this place a kid-friendly restaurant due to the atmosphere and concept. But the service is way too slow! The number one thing that I look for when bringing kids out to eat is fast service. It's no secret that kids have no patience for waiting 15+ minutes for a check. And happy kids equal happy customers. Crying and winy kids equal annoyed and unhappy customers. So speed it up at least please!
2	"""I went in there on the 4th with 5 other friends and had quite possibly the worst service Ive ever had there. There was a 20 minute wait so we went to the bar to wait and have a drink and an appetizer, our table came up around 15 minutes later and we asked the batender to transfer our bill ( I left him a tip on the bar) he said he couldnt transfer alcohol. What? Ive worked and still work in the industry for 20 years and have never heard of such a rule. He was probably afraid that he wouldnt get tipped.  We were hoping to be out in time for fireworks so right when we sat down my friend tells Heather, our server, that he'll have the lasagne due to the fact that he knows it takes 45 minutes. She put in the order and when she came back, we were all ready to order. 2 people ordered a salad , 1 guy got a pasta dish and the other 2 of us decided on pizza. We were told the stuffed takes an hour so we opted for the thin crust. She says \do you guys want things as they come up\""""? We said \""""No, we want to have dinner together\"""" (Thats why we all went there TOGETHER, duh). She says she'll \""""time it out best she can\"""". So, after 45 minutes pass, he gets his lasagne and nobody elses food comes up. So, we wait and wait. 20 minutes more pass and we havent seen our server, a manager, or our food. (Lasagne got cold, by the way). He gets up and goes to ask the manager where our food and/or server are and hes told \"""" you got your food and you guys have drinks, so your good, right?\"""" An hour and 40 minutes after we sat down, we all had food ready and asked to have it boxed so we could try to catch fireworks. (Which we missed because Heather isnt very good at \""""timing it out\"""". She also obviously lacks communication because if she wouldve just came to our table and told us what happened which is obvious, she tried to time it right for us but forgot to put in the rest of the order and didnt realize it til the lasagne came up, we wouldve been fine. She avoided our table instead and the jackass of a manager didnt even try  to help the situation. He was completely unprofessional and said something to her in front of us. What a jerk! 4 out of the 6 people at that table are industry people and have been there and made the same mistake. We totally wouldve understood but the way this was handled was horrible. To boot, as we left, they said in unison..very snidely I might add... \""""Enjoy the rest of your 4th\""""....just awful business altogether!"""""""
5	I had been hearing about Gangplank for as long as I can remember. My first encounter was towards the beginning of this year when I swung by for a peak during an event. I absolutely fell in love with the space and the concept. Since then, I have been holding my IxDA Phoenix events there and heading to Gangplank for other meetings and events. They have been so helpful by not only allowing me to hold IxDA Phoenix there, but also asking me if I'd like a permanent spot on their calendar. \n\nIt's a perfect spot to foster collaboration, ideas, and discussion. There are white boards, tons of tables and chairs, wifi and so much more. People are always there to bounce ideas off of, and you can't help but be inspired when you sit down and get ready to accomplish a goal.\n\nMost recently I was there for the ReOpen Phoenix event last night. I love music and get a kick out of seeing the results of collaboration of different styles and genres so I thought I would sit in for a bit and have a listen. I ended up staying there until the very end. The music was fantastic, it was great to meet new people, and I ended up being able to get some work done all at the same time. This definitely needs to happen more often.\n\nTruly a great place to spend a few hours at if you need to get something accomplished! Great things happen here!
2	How slow can a restaurant be? Certainly not slower than this place, despite being only a quarter full at best.  Some friends wanted to meet here for lunch today thinking we'd be out in less than an hour, but apparently that was asking too much, despite the fact that our horribly complicated order consisted of only two salads, a side of steamed vegetables, and a kid's meal.  After waiting so long for our order to be taken and to get our food, we asked for the check right away because we had to eat and run.  While we continued to wait for the check, numerous other tables got served and all the servers joined in a signature birthday chant at another table.  eventually they got around to bringing our check.  And then came the dilemma of breaking a $20 bill.  Nearly 20 minutes just for that.  WHAT were they thinking???  They weren't busy and there were plenty of staff around.\n\nSo onto the food...  I had the Village Salad, a chopped blend of onions, cucumbers, green peppers, olives, tomatoes, etc.  with no lettuce.  Very tasty.  In the past I've had the hummus - it's fine, and the tsaziki - it's fine.  The service at previous visits was fine.  I would have gone with 3 stars if not for the horrible service today.
2	Average in an area filled with average Italian joints.  That actually makes it below average.  Pizza, great pizza, is easy to come by in Phoenix.  Nick's just does not have the quality of toppings or edge like an amazing crust or some sort of style.  Think freezer pizza.  For the other entrees, the pasta was good, but nothing that you could not make at home in 20 min.  Top it off with indifferent service and you've got a solid 2 star review.
5	Seams To Be Alterations is fantastic and I am so grateful to have found it. I decided to give it a try based on the wonderful yelp reviews and was not at all disappointed! The service was very friendly, the pricing is a wonderful value, and the clothes I had altered ( three pairs of designer jeans shortened with original hem) were completed very quickly. The only other thing I could possibly want was for the alterations to have been done well....and once again I was not dissappointed....everything was perfect! I will most definitely be back.
3	"""Sweet Tomatoes.  What the heck.  \n\nThe new Field Kitchen concept is \ok\"""".  It needs some tweaking!  The biggest problem I think I had was that I wasn't expecting it.  If I return knowing what I am getting into, I'd probably enjoy it more.  We went in there hoping for a lot of food for not a lot of cash.. but alas, Sweet Tomatoes has gone a la carte.\n\nThe first station is salad: you can get a specialty salad or make-your-own.  The make-your-own version is comparable to what we went in for.  At the end, you get the option to add meat, skewers, etc for another couple dollars.  The make-your-own salad comes with a bowl for soup (or macaroni.. because that's a soup) and a waffle cone for soft-serve ice cream later.  Swipe your little FK credit card.\n\nNext station is bread and sides.  The bread is free, whew.  Every other side is priced individually.  We got samples during our preliminary tour... they were good.  I'll tell you, if bread hadn't been included, we'd have staged a revolution.  If you want some pasta or other side... swipe the FK CC.\n\nThe last station is beverages, where you can get a fountain drink with free refills, or a special juice, or a bottled beverage.  Swipe that card.\n\nIf you want dessert beyond the ice cream (IF you got it included with your make-your-own salad) you can return to that station for a cookie, cheesecake, etc.  Swipe!\n\nAfter you eat, you give your little card to a cashier and pay.  You cannot leave the restaurant without a card.  I'm not gonna lie, that creeps me out.\n\nSooo quality of the food: Salad was comparable to before, but there were no mixed greens?  Either spinach or iceberg.  Not my fav.  Macaroni and cheese has gone downhill.  As I mentioned, the samples we tried were good, but I declined purchasing more food.  \n\nConcept: Interesting.  The biggest flaw was that each station had only a small counter for resting one's tray, so in addition to carrying that tray to and fro, one must also stand and hold it as they wait their turn to swipe the FK card.  Too much tray holding.  I liked when I could put it down, slide once, carry once, and we're done.\n\nPrice: For a comparable meal, price is just slightly higher, I think, than it was.  If you give in to all the up-selling, I imagine you could spend quite a lot pretty easily.\n\nService: Great, actually!  I think they about tripled their staff.  There was someone around every turn ready to help.  I can only imagine the rigorous training they'd just been through, and they were at attention the whole time.  We'll give that a few months and see if it sticks."""""""
2	All Style, No Substance...  For all the hype about Olive & Ivy, the food doesn't measure up.  Not sure where the 5 star reviews come from.... not the food for me, nor the service which alternated between crabbiness and nervous hovering. Our patio server didn't want to transfer our check despite the fact we never even received our drinks on the patio before being seated in the restaurant. Our dining room server lingered by our table incessantly, seeming to not know when to approach or interrupt us. \n\nThe food was... eh. Although the scallops were cooked perfectly, they had zero flavor.  The spinach was bland and pointless: not cooked, not raw, with some flavorless broth just splashed over. Could that possibly be the sherry syrup? The dish boasted wild mushrooms (two) and crisp pancetta. Is that what those three tiny chunks were? The lemon aceto on the halibut was excruciating. The tuna tartare was absolutely flavorless. Where was the Red Chile Aioli? The pesto flatbread was perhaps the most edible thing of the evening. The affogatto dessert was described as Vanilla Gelato, Stream Lined Espresso and Kahlua Cream. I didn't mind the puddle of espresso with vanilla ice cream melting in the middle but the unsweetened cream on top...? ick. Where was the Kahlua?  Sangria was tasty, but despite paying for a $6.00 large Pellegrino, it disappeared from my table and I only received half a refill. I only drank 1/4 of the bottle, wherever it was. \n\nCougar alert!!!  Olive & Ivy remains open for its feverish cougar bar scene and patio. It's a shame that the food doesn't merit the incredible building it is served in.
5	This is the most amazing workout you will ever do.  You can watch your body change from week to week.  I have been doing it for nine months, eight classes per month.   I started four months after having ACL knee surgery and it has helped to rehabilitate not just my knee, hip, and legs, but strengthen my entire body.  There is no stress on your joints and ligaments.  You are lengthening, strengthening and toning your muscles.  This is a total body workout burning up to 600 calories per 50 minute session.  The day after taking class you will be sore in places you never knew had muscle.  Each workout is different and it seems that it is always harder than the last class.  There are no beginner classes.  You will sweat.  There is no time for socializing.  The workouts are challenging and if you choose to stick with it, will see results quickly.  No shows cost you $25.00 so that may also keep you motivated to not miss a class.
5	"""So I wrote a review for Papago Brewing way back in the day when I was still new to this whole Yelp thing... so now that I'm a bit more seasoned, I'd like to write an update!\n\nI originally gave Papago 5 stars, and I still don't have a bad word to say about it! This has been my go to bar, my \Cheers\"""", since I first moved to Phoenix two years ago. I've made a lot of friends here (customers AND employees), and I've consumed MANY amazing beers here! I can always count on them having several new craft beers on tap every time I show up, and the staff is very well educated on each of them. Zach, Jess, Matt, Mark, and Sean take great pride in the fact that they are beer nerds (like my wife and I), and always have great suggestions when I can't make up my mind! With 26-30 beers on tap, and several coolers full of different bottled beer from all over the world, it's never hard to find something I'll love!\nThe pizza here is some of my favorite in the valley! We always order the White Pizza, but you have to try the Buffalo Chicken Pizza or the T-Rex! You can't go wrong!\nPapago recently expanded to make more room for their rapidly growing business, as the place is consistently packed almost every night of the week! The new side boasts locally handcrafted tables and benches, as well as a regulation size shuffleboard table!\nWhatever your beer-drinking needs, you'll find it here at Papago Brewing Company!"""""""
4	Went to visit my son and daughter in law this past weekend. We were at some casino which was a little lame and my daughter in law said let's go to The Big Bang. Dueling Pianos reminded me of Dueling Banjos and not something I am overly interested in. Got there and while my daughter in law and son were looking for some coupon at the newspaper rack the cool bouncer let me in with a stamp on my arm and a smile. Thank you kind sir. Kids finally met up with me and downstairs we went. What a trip, it was busy and everyone was having a great time. The crowd was mixed from college kids to older. The music was fantastic. I have to say it was one of the best parts of my vacation this trip to Arizona. It was good fun all the way around. I also want to mention our waitress was just a doll. Loved the bouncer on the side of the stage doing dance moves as were the bartenders. Just a gret evening and I will make sure to go back every trip out there.
5	The best steak that I've had in years. Cooked perfectly, tender, and juicy. And the pesto sauce on top was amazing! The lamb is also fantastic. Service was great, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Nice atmosphere, the patio outside has a firepit and nice outdoor seating. The restaurant is towards the back of the hotel, there was live music in the entry area of the hotel, but you couldn't hear it in the restaurant. It's a bit pricey, but the food is worth it. We plan on visiting again on our next date night. Definitely recommend for a quite dinner out!
2	I've only been here twice... and am still trying to convince myself its worth returning. I'd love to have more good local bar/restaurants in the Grayhawk/Pinnacle area... and hope this place improves. The burgers are barely OK.. not really tasty. I've had much better in the same price range at places that don't advertise 'Cheeseburgers' in their name. The service seems really sketchy... the bar & kitchen can't seem coordinate with the servers... not impressed! For now, I often end up grabbing Pei Wei takeout across the lot... even when I'm in the mood for a burger/steak (frequently).\n\nFor what it's worth, a $30 gift card wouldn't be an enticement... reading on here that some kitchen reality show had stopped by and saved this place would be great!
5	"""The nicest people EVER, and the place is absolutely gorgeous! \n\nNot only is the money spent here kept in the state, it's kept in the neighborhood (the owners live only blocks away in the heart of CenPho). The entire place is self constructed of the blood, sweat, and tears of the owners (a Husband and Wife team), and they have great design sense.\n\nAs for the class, here's the deal ... I know nothing about Yoga, and this was my first Yoga class. It kicked my slacker ass, but I felt all the better for it. The cute as hell instructor could not have been a nicer person (I'm seeing a pattern here). She instructed the class in a relaxing yet deliberate and concise manner.\n\nJust a top notch business all around. Did I mention that the owners were out of the world nice, cool and down to earth people? Well it can't be said enough ... \n\nThank you SuTRA!\n\n----- \nnote\n-----\n\nYes SuTRA helped us with a benefit for our PODCAST (not me personally, and something they did not have to do) ... and their help had NOTHING to do with my review (outside of getting to know what wonderful people they are). So there's your \full Disclosure\"""".\n\nPerhaps Tyler may want to disclose HIS conflict of interest in his posts. For about a year now he's been publicly dissing our Podcast (all this while working for a competing web site). \n\nI just feel really sorry for him."""""""
4	I've been to virtually every dog park in the East Valley, including all the ones in Gilbert, and almost all the  ones in Chandler(except West Chandler Park), Tempe, Mesa (except the one off Greenfield), Scottsdale and Ahwatukee.  Most of the Tempe Dog parks are tiny, with the exception of the one on Carver in S. Tempe.  Cosmo in Gilbert is a pig sty and reflects many of the people who go there.  The water feature is disgusting and has caused many infections(eyes, ears, Giardia, etc).  It's very impressive when you get out of your car and start to approach it from up the hill, but that's deceptive.  The only things I like about it is that it's divided into 3 sections and has 3 nice hosing stations.  Chaparral is pretty nice, but I wish the people would clean up after their dogs more (you get the feeling some think it's beneath them---pun intended).  \n\nThe Shawnee Dog Park is definitely one of the best ones.  Some reviews complained about people not picking up their dog's poop.  This occurs at most parks to some degree, but this one is far better than Cosmo or Chaparral in that regard.  This one feels like an actual park, with lots of trees, grass and a few places to sit down. Most of the people are friendly and the dogs aren't exceptionally rowdy.  The fact that it is surrounded by neighborhoods is probably bad for the residents, but good for you since it means you don't have the traffic noise and fumes coming from a main artery.\n\n I recommend bringing your own bags, as the city doesn't supply them (people bring them and stuff them into dispensers).  I also recommend bringing your own water, as the water there comes from hoses, which can impart chemicals into the water run through them unless they are special hoses designed to prevent this (and I doubt these hoses have the coating required).    Be aware that the park is closed Tuesdays and doesn't open until 9 AM on  Sundays, which can be a problem in the summer.\n\nI intend to write a review next about the one in Tempe between Kyrene and Priest (the address is Hardy, but you  can't access it from Hardy) on Carver.  I think it's called the Tempe Sports Complex.  I usually go there because I prefer it by a little.  The drive for me is about the same, about 5 miles.
3	I love Sacks for take-out. They have some of the best sandwiches around. I especially love the Impressionist (the veggie sandwich) and the salmon sandwich (forgot what it's called). Their bread is always fresh and they have lots of delicious sandwich add-ons like fresh avocado and sprouts. \n\nThey're no NY deli, but then again, they're not trying to be.\n\nGet your sandwich to go or have them cater a lunch. One thing to keep in mind that their hours are unpredictable and that they're never open when you want them to be!
2	I'm putting this place on BLAST! Me and my wife came in because we got the email about some great happy hour specials they have. But they are sneaky, they don't give you a sushi sheet with happy hour deals only they give you one with everything so if you make a mistake you get to pay full price :). SNEAKY, SNEAKY. The waitress goes over our order and everything we got was on special accept I accidentally marked 1 yellow tail instead of Spicy yellow tail, so it was $6 instead of $3. Common sense would tell the waitress that we only wanted happy hour specials but I guess common sense is not that common for this one. Also the Sushi was prepared ahead of time and my wife ended up getting SICK! This is just another little hipster Sushi joint that blasts Trendy music and only hires Hot trendy waitresses.I'd rather go to Hiro and skip all the Flash!
4	I have been a member of 24 hour fitness for years and had grown very disappointed with the facilities and their maintenance. The only reason I kept my membership is because I bought into an incredible rate. \n\nAny who I live really close to this location and decided I didn't feel like driving to my other gym. I was very impressed! The equipment is up-to-date and CLEAN! I can't begin to express my delight in getting on an elliptical trainer that actually works and isn't corroded from the sweat accumulation. They make cleaning supplies easily available and people actually clean up after themselves. Who knew?? LOL \n\nThe spin classes are fantastic! They have some of the best instructors I have ever had. Be sure to arrive early because they fill up very fast!
4	"""We were hankering for a new taco place.  We were super excited to see that there was a new two hippies.  \nUpon arrival the place had zero customers.  I asked the owner how long she had been open and had some small talk with her.  She described some of the items on the menu and it all sounded super good.  She is very nice.  \nI ordered a passion fruit lemonade.  The lemonade is definitely worth just stopping in.  Not too sweet, not too tart and it's blended!\nI ordered carne asada taco which was \alright.\""""  Sorta bland...\nI also ordered a chicken taco which was better and finally the shredded pork taco.. Stick with the pork.. it has a great green chili sauce on it.  Overall great flavor.\nI'm rating this place at 4 stars because it's low priced, decent food and the owner was a really sweet lady."""""""
5	Best of Philly in my opinion is hands down the Best Cheese Steak in the Valley.\n\nThey build sandwiches to your liking with fresh baked bread, lean steak grilled with olive oil and real American cheese. \n\nYes the place is small, however the owner has a giant heart. He and his wife have stayed true to form and their passion for cleanliness and quality shines through with every menu item.\n\nMy business partner and I have made the pilgrimage to Best of Philly in Phoenix every week from Tempe for six years running.\n\nBest of Philly experimented with a second location in Mesa; however, they sold that store off, so be sure to stick to the real deal and grab a coupon from the website.
5	"""I am a chef by trade, and cook most of my family's meals, and often have a hard time eating out.  A common joke that my wife and I share when we go out for a special high-end dinner is what appetizers will I prepare at home before we leave just in case we are disappointed $100 later.  Well I was on a \Daddy Daughter Date,\"""" with my 14 year old and wound up at this waffle house.  Needless to say I was skeptical, the place was virtually empty yet the server was friendly and the place was clean.  Looking at the menu I thought the prices were a bit high for a restaurant of this caliber, but I feel that any sub-par food is over priced.  My daughter, who would have rather been at McDonald's, ordered a plain cheeseburger ($3.25) without the hash browns (they don't serve FF), and I ordered something like a Philly steak melt ($7.65).  Initially I was looking at a sliced steak sandwich but when I asked the server if it was good she said yes but most people like the Philly steak melt better.  I appreciated that as I didn't feel like chewing too much--my teeth hurt.  I was still skeptical but I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the cook who came from outside the building to cook, but meticulously washed his hands first.  It told me that this man was serious about his craft.  Then a wonderful thing happened.  The cook felt that I would be missing out if I didn't have saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on my sandwich and suggested it.  Yes, I said, yes. The food took a bit to get to us (about 10 mins), but even that was comforting, as I knew that much care was going into this preparation.  We got the food and to my amazement every morsel was magnificent.  I cleaned my plate.  Even my daughter denounced McDonald's as the king of the burger and asked when I will return with her.  \""""Daddy Daughter Day,\"""" was a huge success and I believe in flavor outside of the home again."""""""
5	"""After a long week of running a partner conference, myself and the team wanted something unique to Phoenix, AZ, which had a good steak and seafood combo.  Thanks to Yelp, Durant's came up.  After confirming with the concierge at the resort, we realized the place is pretty legit.\n\nSo we are in the car, driving up, and we pull up at the stoplight across the street.  Looking across, the place looked like a strip club.  Pink building with no windows.....seriously, do we abort?  Ahhh heck, let's do this.\  So the 10 of us go in.  When you walk in, you enter through the kitchen.  The wall paper is red and looks like it has texture to it.  \""""ok, are we making the right choice? Yes, we are here let's do it\""""\n\nI ordered the Bone in Ribeye and let me tell you, it was to die for.  Even better than that was the scallops and loaded baked potato. \n\nDessert came, and oh snap daddy likes. Creme brulee in three styles: coconut rum, chocolate and berry.\n\nWould I recommend it again?...heck yes!  Rock on Durant's"""""""
4	Ever been to IKEA on a Sunday afternoon? Don't. You'll want to shoot yourself before trying that again. But the mega-mall atmosphere aside (one more thing: the parking lot is a free-for-all. People fly around through these rows acting like they own the place. The Swedish called, speeders: you ain't getting this discount Euro Modern screw-together goodness!) this is a pretty nice spot. Sure, it's like 70 million square feet and the bookcases are named Billy, but come on, you can find some good quality stuff here for great prices. Roche Boibos it ain't. But that's why you come here -- it's affordable, it looks decent and it comes in a nifty box you can put in back of your minivan. And did I mention the breakfast for less than $2? The eggs are kind of rubbery and I'm pretty sure the bacon isn't really bacon, but somehow it tastes damn good. Get there early and skip the dreaded lunch rush for those salty meatballs.
4	People... People... People... \n\nFor being an airport restaurant, Jose Roux is pretty decent. Yes the food is tasteless, but ask for more salsa before you never see your server again. No really, ask for more salsa. \n\nThe margaritas are pretty great for being airport margaritas... \n\nI don't even remember what I had, but in all honesty, it wasn't as bad as past airport restaurants I've been to, and for that I say... Decent job... But really... Your food is bland... \n\nGREAT ALCOHOL!!!
5	After seeing the sign for Beaver Choice a few months ago, I had been eager to give it a try. I finally got the chance today. \n\nI was impressed before even ordering. The guy behind the counter was very friendly and ready to offer suggestions. When I inquired about the salmon, he gave me a sample (along with beet and potato salads.)\n\nThe salmon was so delicious, I ended up ordering the Swedish cured salmon sandwich (complete with a sweet dill mustard dressing.) My lovely dining partner ordered the Fresh Mozzarella, salami, tomato\n& basil sandwich and we decided to share an order of poutine. We both enjoyed the sandwiches and loved the poutine! \n\nAlmost as enjoyable as the food was the service. This restaurant is owned by a family who has lived in several parts of the world. They are very friendly and willing to bend over backwards for the customers.\n\nI am excited to go back and delight in more dishes on the menu.
5	AWESOME PIZZA!\n\nYou want more details?\n\nYesterday (my first time at Pizzeria Bianco)  I arrived at 5 minutes to 3 - I was second in the line.  As time passed, and more people arrived, we began chatting.  Just wandering from conversation to conversation - very relaxed - very laidback - casual - fun.\n\nThe family in 3rd place turned out to be regulars.  They're Italian.  They chatted amongst themselves in Italian.  They chatted with the rest of us in English - with a noticeable Italian accent.\n\nThe hostess (who is a knockout!) was charming.  I have no idea about the reviews claiming that she's rude.  Get some people skills people!\n\nBeing solo, I sat at the bar.  A glass of Dos Cabesas & a Margherita with red onions & garlic.\n\nThose of us at the bar - all strangers to each other - chatted like we were at party at our next door neighbors'.  The ambience of this former machine shop - with the wood-burning brick pizza oven - is charming & romantic.  I will have to return with my GF.\n\nThe wine was smooth and delicious.  The pizza -- now yuh gotta understand - I worked at Gino's Pizza on East McDowell before you were born -- was AMAZING!  But, that's exactly what I expected.  My mouth told me that it's so very happy I took it to Bianco, and I like to make my mouth happy.\n\nSo, go.  Expect to wait.  Relax.  Chat with people.  Have fun.  Your mouth will.\n\nAWESOME PIZZA!\n\nAny questions?
2	I would have given this place one star, but the free cookie deserved an extra star.  The snickerdoodles are chewy and delicious.  As for the rest of the food, it was not worth the money or the calories.  We saw this place on an old episode of DDD and decided it was time we try it.  They make it look A LOT better on tv than it is in real life.  Two couples walked in after us and they both received food ten minutes before we received ours.  I guess a quesadilla takes ten minutes to cook??  Try other DDD places, NOT this one.
5	Five stars, hands down!!\n\nFOOD: I ordered the Ms. Croque Madam and it was divine! Perfection at its best. Its smoked ham, crispy bacon, over easy egg on lightly melted gruyere with a creamy delicious Dijon mustard on a crispy French baguette.\n\nENVIRONMENT: lovely! You instantly feel classy like you're in a scene from Sex and the City having brunch and liquor with your girl friends catching up on the madness of your lives.\n\nATTIRE: it says casual and we went that way... in just t-shirts and jeans, but the other patrons make you feel out of place because they dress pretty nice. But the restaurant doesn't care what you dress like.\n\nMy friend said the Dijon was a little too overpowering on hers, but I loved it. So heads up... if you don't like mustard, go easy on it or ask for it on the side. Otherwise, it's a perfect combination of ingredients.\n\nSERVICE: The Swiss hostess was lovely and sweet with an enchanting accent! Our server, Amy, was so awesome!! I'd travel all the way back from LA to AZ just to come here for the service. She was so funny, sweet and friendly. She made our big group of 5 feel so comfortable and happy even though initially we felt out of place because we weren't dressed as snazzy as everyone else was. She has a way of making you feel comfortable and at ease. She's the best server I've ever had at any place ever. I wish more servers could be like her, I can't say enough about how awesome she is. She clearly loves her job and goes above and beyond her duties to make you feel at home and like you have known her forever. At first we ordered mimosas and they were delicious, the freshly squeezed orange juice was perfect in it, but we were feeling a bit more adventurous afterwards and we asked her for a recommendation. She suggested something with Patron Cafe XO. I told her my favorite types of drinks and she instantly came up with something right off the top of her head that sounded like a heavenly concoction, a White Russian Patron Cafe XO. Basically a regular White Russian with Cafe XO instead of Kahlua. Being that White Russians are my favorite drinks, this one definitely hit the spot and I found it much much more delicious than the usual White Russian. Mmmmm! I went out and bought Cafe XO right after that because of that drink.\n\nLove this place, love Amy!!
1	I previously took my clothes here with OK results.  At this point, will never go again and suspect new ownership/management.  I had a bad experience one Satturday in May and chalked it up to bad luck (it is $2.25 for dry clearning so I do not expect superior cleaning/service), but the last time I went will be the last time I go!  I took several plain scarves and 2 shirts for cleaning on Saturday morning with pick-up in the afternoon. Nothing was actually clean - the shirts smelled like chemials but had not been cleaned or properly ironed.  The scarves smelled like cigarette smoke (I don't smoke), as though they were jammed in a bag with smelly clothes all day.  Disgusting!  I will never use these cleaners again.   \nBTW - the name and address seem to change - this place is on 59th avenue and the 101, southwest corner.  The dry cleaning place is next to a bagel shop.  Avoid them!
5	Since I have posted a dog question on 'talk' today ( http://tinyurl.com/5cuox7 ), I thought I'd share a great Vet!\n\nRoughly a year ago I was looking for a Vet for my rescued pooch, she needed her final round of boosters, rabies shot and micro chip.  I asked around and took the advice from a friend to give Dr. John Clark a try after a bit of research online.\n\nDr. Clark has been in practice in Phoenix for over 45 years. He is also currently the Board President of phoenix area emergency clinics; a group which is owned by 177 veterinarians and serves the emergency and critical care needs of over 300 Phoenix area practices. Needless to say, Dr. Clark is well respected by his peers; recommended by his clients and vets alike. \n\nOne of the main reasons I use and respect Dr. Clark is his honesty. I have heard from two clients, who recommended him; he will not sell you on the extras. He doesn't believe in selling medications your animal doesn't need and treatments that are not necessary. So rather than a Vet that's out for the buck, he's a Vet of sincerity and integrity. In addition, the pricing at Orangewood Animal Hospital is extremely competitive and reasonable. \n\nThe staff at Orangewood Animal Hospital is wonderful as well. I have called with questions in the past, they are always happy to help. If they don't know the answer they'll put you on hold and ask Dr. Clark, so your sure to get the correct answer to your question. If a medication is needed, they stock and sell it at economical prices. I tend to go the holistic / natural route with my pooch, so I've never taken them up on medication outside of boosters, rabies shots and micro chip. \n\nI have given Orangewood Animal Hospital 5 stars, so if you're looking for a Vet, give them a try!\n\nOrangewood Animal Hospital is located roughly 2 blocks north of Glendale Road on the east side of 7th street.  They treat dogs, cats and exotics.\n\n\nHere is a list of services offered..............\n\nAdvanced Surgical Procedures\nAdvanced Cardiology\nComplete Companion Animal Care\nComplete Dental Care and X-Ray Services\nDentistry\nDiagnostic Services on site\nDiagnostic Ultrasonography\nDietary and Nutritional Counseling\nElective Surgeries and Orthopedics\nExaminations, Vaccinations, Surgery and Medicine\nGeriatric Care\nICG Services\nInternal Medicine\nMedical Diagnostics and Hospitalized Treatment\nMicrochipping\nPrescription Diet Pet Food\nProfessional Flea and Tick Products\nPregnancy Ultrasonography\nPre and Postnatal Services\nRadiology\nRoutine Health Examinations\nRoutine Small Animal Medical and Surgical Services\nRoutine Surgeries\nSmall Animal Medicine and Surgery for Cats and Dogs\nWellness and Preventive Medicine
4	Whether the food is good or bad, one has to appreciate a place where the owner all-too-conspicuously wanders about the dining area during peak times, visiting with the guests, monitoring the staff, and demonstrating her full control over the operation.\nI'm talking about Flo.\n\nOn a recent visit, this was the case as we watched Flo monitor her staff and patrons, disappearing from site every now and again, I presume to monitor the kitchen staff. She was like an Asian dust-devil!\n \nThe kung pao was a little too sweet for me, but to my delight, we also ordered the Vindaloo chicken....not so much vindaloo as curry, but the sauce was creamy and flavorful, making up for its lack of authenticity. Overall, both tasty dishes.\n\nDuring our visit, a server dropped some glassware, sending it into a thousand broken pieces. Flo was right there to monitor the cleanup and insure no-one stepped on the glass. \n\nI really appreciated the vigilance of Flo, as it demonstrates why she's been so successful....hard work and passion.\nSomething you don't or practically never see in a chain restaurant or its staff. \nKudos Flo.\nBeautiful recovery from prior visits, making you my current top choice for Chinese.
2	This place sounds cooler than it is. The employees literally do not acknowledge you at all! Everything is divided into stations (toddlers, travel, high school..) which is kind of cool but sometimes the paper that's in a certain station that doesn't apply there at all. The worst part is that none of the paper has price tags! You have to ring it up before you know the price - which is probably too expensive. So it would be cool if you were looking for something really original that you just couldn't find anywhere else (like specific state or country embellishments) but other than that I would definitely just go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels.
5	I tried OllieCake cupcakes today and they are the most amazing, tastiest cupcakes I have ever eaten. I tried the orange, coconut, strawberry, and peanut butter cupcakes. Right now the orange is my favorite, but I am trying the chocolate tomorrow. They are so moist and the frosting is the perfect balance of lightness and sweetness. Not too heavy, just right :)  You can really taste the quality and the organic ingredients really make a difference. These will be the only cupcakes I buy from now on, I'll never be able to eat a cupcake that comes out of a box again!
4	Its my go to Japanese Restaurant in Arizona. Name is originated in Kyoto, Japan, where the owner is from. So You can expect real Japanese food here.   The got some American sushi rolls here, so all the roll lovers can enjoy the sushi also.  Although I haven't tried their sushi's I expect it to be pretty fresh and good.  Can be pricey, but that is what you expect when eating at good Japanese restaurant. I only saw one other customer when I was there, hope people in AZ are more into experiencing Japanese foods.
4	OK, I don't consider Panda to be authentic Asian. I don't consider Taco Bell Mexican food either, but sometimes, I like to indulge in both. I used to be a frequent visitor of Panda but kinda cut back just due to trying to eat healthier. But I found myself stopping in at this location the other day and was please that they started offering steamed veggies instead of rice, even though they are probably drowning in butter, I was glad that they had some other option. I think they have always had the veggies, but it counted as an item, not a side. I may be wrong on both either way, Orange chicken = Crazy Delicious!
5	The food at Yellowtail is great! I love that they serve not only sushi but also Chinese food, tepenyaki, and even American food.  They also have a great kids menu. Basically the whole family can go there even if some aren't sushi lovers.  Everything we've tried is delicious! The service there is friendly and helpful. The food comes out fast and they always make sure you are doing okay.  They also have a good Happy Hour menu with a lot of variety and $2 draft beer.   My whole family definitely recommends Yellowtail!
3	C & C started off really strong then fell off so I will average it out to a 3.  I must use other breakfast spots around town as my marker.  The standout dishes were the California Eggs Benny & the Eggs Benny Florentine.  The free sample of Berry Bread Pudding was deliciouso!!!! The healthcakes were the straw that broke the camel's back for me.  Their food just lacks a little somethin' I can't put my finger on.  I need consistency in my restaurants!  And I know it sounds weird, but I don't like the hazy lighting.
1	"""Instead of a review, here is the letter I wrote AJs about my experience in their store. They NEVER responded,  and now I can no longer, in good conscience,  shop there because of their apathy.\n\n\I'm writing, because I had an experience at your store that I just can't stop thinking about. I visited last Sunday, Oct. 30th- close to closing time. As I was checking out, the cashier (a younger man- he looked like he might be of Latino decent) was incredibly polite and professional. However, I had a very negative/offensive experience with another employee of your store that appeared to have just finished her shift and was waiting in line behind me to make a purchase (she was a middle aged woman, with dyed blond hair and heavy eye make-up). As my friend and I were making our purchase, we briefly chatted with the kind cashier. I, in error, went to the wrong place to check out. Your cashier made a friendly comment about how at Costco they have arrows to guide people and that it was an easy mistake for me to go to the wrong spot. It was just friendly rapport. I suppose he was trying to ease my mind in case I felt embarrassed, which I appreciated the gesture. \n\nAnyhow, while he was talking with my friend and myself, the woman interrupts and starts loudly saying to the cashier helping us, and I am QUOTING her, \""""Not MY Costco, you live with 'needy' people! You go to the 'needy' people Costco. My Costco is beautiful because there aren't any 'needy' people there. I live in a different city than YOU. I don't live amongst 'needy' people. We're not needy where I live like YOUR city\"""". \n\nSadly, I am not exaggerating this in anyway. I was completely appalled by the lack of  basic manners. \n\nThis woman is completely unprofessional. Regardless of her personal feelings towards wherever the young man lives or her delusional superiority over \""""needy\"""" people... laughable, since she is working at a grocery store but that's beside the point. I can not believe she would have the audacity to speak to this young man in this manner in front of CUSTOMERS. \n\nDespite her rude, insensitive and unprofessional comments, the young man remained gracious and kind and never said and unkind word or even gave an unkind glance while this woman was attempting to belittle and humiliate him in front of customers. She is lucky that I was too shocked by her behavior to say something at the time, because I am and was completely disgusted. This has left a lasting impression, a negative one to say the least, and I certainly hope that you have a talk with this woman about basic manners and conduct- even if I wasn't present- her behavior is basically harassment and no person should have to deal with such ignorance and insensitivity.\"""""""""""
5	Now I wish I would have actually gone to pick up my samich instead of sit at work and wait for it's arrival.  I had heard very good things about this deli, so when i finally got bored of the same ole lunch I bring to work every day it was time to get in on this following.  I had the italian sub on wheat bread.  Um, talk about Freshness!  I'm pretty sure I ate the whole thing in like 3 minutes because I just couldn't get enough.  The bread was so soft, the meat was outstanding, and the provolone was real!  Alll it had was oil and vinegar on it with lettuce tomato and the typical italian meats.  I normally cannot eat a sandwhich without mayo and mustard, specially some spicy brown.  That was wonderful, but now after reading these reviews, it's time for me to check out that Chicken Salad, I love chicken salad.
4	The burgers are good! The decor of this place is nice and I like the Nostalgia of it.. I really liked that they showed the History of Freddy on the walls. It's nice to know that there was a real guy who started this place & even nicer knowing he's a Veteran! If I find myself near the area again I will go back with out a doubt! Much better choice then the everyday fast food chains that clutter our city streets.
3	I have been to this restaurant at least 10 times and with the exception of the last visit OUTSTANDING food and service. Saturday, October 1st WORST and Rudest service person I have ever encountered. SHE is in the WRONG BUSINESS! Forgot desert entirely and brought bill before asking if we were finished. Was so mad that she gave the deserts FREE and complained when we ordered an after dinner drinks. She stated that she had already run the final bill and had alreasy given us drinks free! Unbelieveable!!  EARL
4	I'm a little bit country. I'm a little bit rock n roll...thank you Donny and Marie. Pinnacle Peak General Store is all country baby. 100% U.S. grade countrilicous! Well, ok, it's in North Scottsdale so it's got a pretty yuppified clientele. Part gas station, convienence store, cafe and post office....this is the cutest place ever. Was kinda my morning hang when I lived at DCRanch. Cup o joe, and the #1 Breakfast with 1 pancake, 2 eggs and bacon. I'm tellin' ya...it's good. Hard to screw up bacon and eggs so I'll rave about my pcake...a bit crispy around the edges and full of buttermilk flavor. Syrup is heated just right and comes in a squeeze bottle the waitress pulls out of her apron pocket. Is that a squeeze bottle of syrup in your apron or are you just happy to see me? Coffee is sturdy and aromatic...like my lesbian cousin Rita. I haven't eaten off the lunch menu...to me it's all about breakfast. My friends have ordered and enjoyed canteloupe with cottage cheese and some kind of omelette which escapes me now, cuz, frankly, I'm not a big fan of the omelette. Childhood trauma and I can't go into it now. The funniest thing about this place are the copper pots and other bric a brac hanging from the rafters that are all for sale. Some of the pots are like $100! OMG....They also have a gas pump that's like $5,000...I guess that's where North Scottsdale meets the country general store. So hitch up the wagon and skeedaddle on up to the Pinnacle Peak General Store. Tell 'em Thomas sent ya
3	Seeking out local evening entertainment last spring (cab fares to Tempe can really break the bank), I frequented Bar Smith on a number of occasions with my friends. Each visit, I had a pleasant time--savoring the bar's laid back atmsophere on its roof deck and (relatively) cheap drinks served by friendly bartenders.  Bud Lights are $3/bottle.\n\nI expect it will become even more of a happening place when the light rail starts running in December and patrons can enjoy the view of trains arriving and departing from the rooftop.\n\nTwo things kept me from giving Bar Smith four stars: 1.) the expensive cover charge ranging from $7-$10/person and 2.) the bathroom attendant in a room the size of a porta-potty. Can you say unnecessary?
5	Simply awesome.  The drinks are good and the boba is fantastic.  Boba Tea House has a huge variety of flavors available - everything from the simple (mango, peach, thai tea, etc.) to the more exotic (taro, lychee, jackfruit, red bean, and others).  Be warned that some of the more exotic flavors are pretty weird by American standards, and if you don't know what you're getting yourself into, you might not be happy with your drink.  That said, everything I've had here has been good, and it's always made quickly without much wait at all.  They do have punch-cards if you go here often, and you'll get a free drink for every 9 drinks you purchase.\n\nScrew going to Starbucks for a crapuccino - I'll stick with boba tea.
5	"""What can be said about Bianco that hasn't been said before? Pizzeria Bianco has been raved about for many years now, with good reason! Chris Bianco has built his establishment into a Phoenix staple. Every visit I'd say well over half of his clientele is brand new, no small feat since he's spent 14 years in the same location. To say the least, Pizzeria Bianco is a well-reviewed, well-loved and die-hard restaurant.\n\nPut this into perspective: I've patronized Pizzeria Bianco roughly 40-50 times (many of those times have been in post-100 degree heat, non-coincidentally the Bar Bianco next-door opens an hour earlier than the Pizzeria so grab a beer) and each time I've waited 1-2 hours for the privilege. Are there many places in the whole world where you'd do that? Once you taste the sensation within, you'll understand.\n\nThe pizzas are wood-fired in a brick oven and until recently, they'd all been fired and created by one man, Chris Bianco, whom forcefully had to take a leave of absence from his dedication to his craft. Why? All the wood smoke and flour dust has taken a toll on him over the years and irritated his asthma to a point where his doctor insisted that he stay out of the kitchen if he wanted to live into his 50s. It may seem silly to an outsider but to see Chris's passion for what he does, you'd instantly empathize.\n\nThe creations that come from the oven are simple, yet complex in flavor and texture. They're thin-crust Italian style pizzas that are true to the heart of Tuscany and Roma. In true Italian spirit, less is more on the pizza with only a few ingredients playing on the stage. My favorite at Bianco is to order a Margarita pizza and add mushrooms and perhaps some garlic. What returns is amazing. You wouldn't think that dough, tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil, Criminis and garlic could formulate something so flavorful and distinct but there it is.\n\nA favorite before the pizza is unquestionably an Antipasto plate! Familiar ingredients grace the plate almost every time (mushrooms, sopressata, olives and parmesan) with one or two guest players (eggplant parm or roasted red pepper). Given a health dose of olive oil and graced in the oven, the plate comes to you a variety of textures and tastes.\n\nThere are a few salads offered as well. The pizza, antipasto and salads comprise the entire menu. It's simple but elegant in a setting at Heritage Square that makes it a true, one-of-a-kind experience and completely unique to Phoenix. Yes, you need some time to kill (I recommend getting there at least an hour before opening) and the ability to tolerate weather and a few line cutters, but you will be rewared with what has been called and I whole-heartedly agree is the \best pizza in America\""""."""""""
3	Probably not my first choice of places to hit (I live fairly close and can probably count on one hand the number of times I've been here). The place tends to get a little too crowded for my taste and if you're not there for happy hour, the drink prices ain't exactly cheap.\nOn the other hand, the atmosphere is fun and lively, the service is usually friendly enough and I love the new patio. I figure if you have some cash and the right crowd you probably could do worse.......you may have to park a few blocks down the street but at least you can walk some of the booze off when you call it a night.
4	We arrived at 7 am on a Saturday morning and there was no wait. Even at 8 am there weren't a lot of people there. I had the brioche french toast with the carmelized bananas, and they were amazing. My mom had the ham steak with red eye gravy, and we enjoyed the food but I wouldn't say this dish wasn't anything special. The hashbrowns were good but no different from any other restaurant. I didn't enjoy the coffee as much and at $2.25/ cup- that seemed expensive. Waitstaff was really friendly.
3	Moral of this story: Go with your gut!\n\nI was debating between fish and short rib, fish and short rib. Practically everyone else at the table went with fish, so I decided to branch out and get red meat...I mean the place is called Modern Steak after all, right? I wish I went with the fish. I've been super picky lately about food when I eat out (which stems from the fact that I've been cooking a lot at home and I'm damn good-toot, toot (that's my own horn)), so maybe it's just me, but I thought it was really fatty and didn't offer much meat. The horseradish gnocchi were a really strange texture and I thought the horseradish was a little overwhelming. The starters and sides were great though. Chopped salad, grilled artichoke, squash and sweet potatoes...mmmmm. \n\nKnow Before You Go: IMHO, North has the best braised short rib in the Sam Fox gaggle of restaurant concepts. Get the fish at Modern Steak ;).
5	I support local business, recycle everything, eat clean, and consume as much used product as I possibly can. If you're anything like me, Changing Hands Bookstore is the place to spend your hard earned money. Everyone in there makes you feel welcome, from the cashiers to the stockers and your fellow shoppers. I also actively participate in many of the events held by Changing Hands. (Book signings, language classes, discussion groups, workshops, ect.) Oh and if they don't have what you're looking for in stock, they will gladly order it.\n\nGet involved.
3	Went here for the lunch buffet today -- seemed to be pretty standard fare.  The food was good, including a very tasty raw vegetable salad.  It would have been useful if they marked which of the dishes were vegan versus vegetarian.\n\nIt was decorated nicely, but the service was a bit slow, and we had to flag someone down to get refills on our water.  And the actual temperature of the room was pretty warm, and it got uncomfortable towards the end of our lunch.
3	The parlor looks amazing, really I uploaded a photo background worthy so decor is top notch, and the quality of the food is really good not to leave out the service which was fine, but . . . No matter how nice a place looks and how good the components are if not put together right it won't work.  The flavor was ok and that was the problem for me the pizza was priced right, made with quality ingredients in a very cool setting but it didnt satisfy.  I hope they rework their recipes to add more flavor because I love this atmosphere and the pizza was quality but missing enough flavor to keep me from coming back.  I haven't been to many places where the food wasnt great when the ingredients were so  I'm sure some little tweaks will get me to add a star or two :)
1	"""This hotel is so terrible that even thinking of a logical comparison is difficult - describing it in terms of other hotels does not fully capture how much is wrong with it. If I pissed in a cup and threw it at you, that would make a better hotel than this place.\n\nWhere's a good place to start ... how about the location? In terms of position within the city, it's in the middle of nowhere; if you need a cab, it will take 45 minutes to show up, owing to the fact that it's outside their normal area and most cabs in Phoenix are computer-dispatched. In terms of local location, it's in an industrial district between a vacant lot and a lumber yard. There's not a store, a restaurant, a drugstore, a gas station, ANYTHING for a mile in any direction.\n\nThe hotel itself is a complete shithole. The buildings are what you would expect those gray-slab communist apartments in the Soviet Bloc to be like, only I've actually been to the former USSR and the communist apartment buildings were nicer. The hallway smelled like cigarette smoke and piss. I didn't see any cockroaches while I was there, but I was actually SURPRISED that I didn't, which is pretty pathetic. Reading that other people encountered them is not a great shock.\n\nEverything inside the room was a piece of shit. The shower had a showerhead that literally came out of the wall at mid-to-low chest level and could not be pointed upward, and the water flow had one available setting, which was \super-hard and focused on an area about the size of a quarter.\"""" I literally had to get down on my hands and knees to wash anything above my torso, then watch out while standing up because of the position of the damn showerhead again - it's fixed in a position so that if you're not careful, you'll get a blast of 100 mph water right in the dick, which happened more than once.\n\nThey do have a bar/lounge next to the main lobby, which when I learned about it, I thought \""""thank god, at least this place has one redeeming quality.\"""" Not really, though. You go in and it will be empty except for maybe one other hotel guest, plus a couple tables full of meth-addict looking people who are there to bet on dog racing at the off-track betting window. \n\nYes, they actually have an off-track betting window for dog racing in the hotel, and a bank of TVs in the bar showing races all night. But in this hotel, it didn't seem even a little bit out of place. What a total shithole."""""""
1	"""The only reason I would set foot in Christopher's again is if my leg fell off right in front of their door and I had to crawl in to call an ambulance.  After I made the call, I would crawl back outside and wait for the ambulance on the sidewalk.  \n\nThe food isn't bad, but I've never been blown away by anything I've eaten there--I've been for both dinner and happy hour, and aside from the wild mushroom pizza, I've never felt the need to order anything a second time.  What blows me away is how bad the service is.  And when I say bad, I mean BAD.  We've stood at the front for several minutes waiting for someone to greet me, only to have multiple staff members including CHRISTOPHER HIMSELF avoid eye contact and walk right past us.  We've sat at the bar next to their sommelier, who proceeded to pour herself multiple glasses of wine from the bottle, get loud and obnoxious with anyone who would listen, and finally wedge herself in between our barstools to take photos of a floral arrangement on the bar.  Drunk doesn't begin to describe the woman that evening, and not one bartender said anything to her or us about it.  But perhaps my favorite Christopher's experience came when we sat at the bar and asked the bartender what he recommended from the dinner menu as we were more familiar with the happy hour menu, and he went over options with us that were \less expensive.\""""  \n\nThanks, Dick.  I didn't ask what was cheap, I asked what was good.  We may look young, but couples like us are your bread and butter.  Unless, of course, you're making enough money off of your sommelier and her affinity for drinking entire bottles of wine alone, in which case I guess you don't need us.  Either way, we won't be back."""""""
5	Hello Gilbert, AZ :). Every now and again, I find myself trekking across the city to visit friends in Chandler and Gilbert area. I've been to Bar en Gril a few times, and so over the halloween weekend I took a few friends with me before we headed out on the town. There was definitely a good crowd going, and they had a live band playing cover songs which everyone was getting into and seemed to enjoy. Overall, it has a very casual and friendly atmosphere that's also family friendly. \n\nThe menu displays your favorite comfort foods and bar fare, with modern presentation and taste. My service experience has been great each time I have been to Bar en Gril, and the owner makes himself available to customers. On the menu you should get the cheese plate for sure, it's perfect for snacking! I've also had their salads, which were flavorful and filling. I NEED to try their pizza, so I'll be back soon to check that off my list.
3	I was so hungry as a result of drinking the night before that, once we made it through the 1.5 hour wait, I ate the chicken without really enjoying it (or giving it time to cool off). BUMMER. Whose idea was it to come to Lo Lo's ON A SUNDAY? (mine). Those who could taste their chicken and remember said it was just okay. Some said they'd prefer KFC (gulp).\n\nThe waffles are too thin and soggy for my liking.\n\nEverything is served with an ice cream scoop's worth of butter. I LOVE IT, screams the fat kid in me.\n\nKool aid and sweet tea are awesome. Fried catfish was tasty. \n\nI think people come here for the ambience more than the food, but I should go back and let it cool before devouring, and I need to try other things. Service is awesome in that no bullshit way, not the service-with-a-smile kind of way. I kind of like it.
2	I've heard they officially changed their name to Big Pile of Crap. \n\nI'm sorry. I know this is a discount store. I'm not expecting cappuccino and Evian while shopping, though it would be a lovely touch.  But could you sweep the floor? I mean you sell brooms for God's sake. \n\nI did score a coffee bean grinder for twelve bucks. But I was covered in cardboard box grime. It's cluttered and hard to navigate the filthy aisles. \n\nReally? Is sweeping too much to ask? Listen, if I ever stop by again, I'll bring my Swiffer.
2	"""Not the greatest. In summary - the waiter told us they had the \best margaritas in scottsdale\"""", which wasn't true they tasted like an average margarita mix lacking in tequila. Next for our appetizers - we ordered a few guacamole, which was way too expensive for the amount you received, and didn't blow me away. Then we ordered the street tacos. I had the chicken, which was very dry, lacking in flavor and almost tasted gamey. There might be better options available, but I wasn't impressed with the items I ordered (especially for the price) and probably won't be returning."""""""
5	I'm giving this 5 stars only because I have yet to find anything better in the east side area. I have tried cupcake, lulu's, etc but this has yet to let me down. Partially because I'm a choco-holic!! And they carry the dark chocolate cupcakes everyday!! I personally have never had a problem with them being dry. There is a lot of frosting but lets me honest, you don't have to eat it all (better than there not being enough)! I definitely only recommend getting what you will eat that day because yes they are a little dry and harder the following morning! But they aren't filled with rubber crap like they do at grocery stores so they aren't meant to keep! I find it best to go there as an early date, like after lunch treat and hopefully find something to split, makes it easier on the wallet and the thighs! \nGetting to it can be done by walking there from the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall or can be entered if you are driving North up Scottsdale Rd best. There are other ways but I won't go into that. There is a lot of parking in the back area, don't waste your time parking up front because it is kind of troublesome, don't make a $3 cupcake cost you a deductible for your car as well.
5	As long as I've lived in or around Tempe, I can't believe it has taken me until today to try this place out! They are definitely my new favorite spot for breakfast, and I can't wait to have lunch there sometime. The food is all local, which is really important to me, and doesn't receive enough attention. It is a big deal to invest in our community, and this place does it. They also recycle and compost!!! Awesome! The food was delicious and unique in flavor. My only complaint would be that their coffee wasn't exactly up to par. Although, I am a bit of a snob when it comes to coffee. And do note that this place is wildly popular, so if you go on a weekend morning, be prepared to wait a little. Sit outside and enjoy yourself on their cute little patio!
4	I went here with the BF for breakfast the other day. It is conveniently located at Cityscape. I really liked the breakfast. I had the breakfast grilled cheese with eggs over medium. It was tasty! Eggs, hash browns, cheese, and really tasty crispy bacon on sourdough..... really extra delicious! The BF has biscuits and gravy and it was also very good! It had a roasted red pepper sauce on top of the gravy that was sweet and spicy. I wouldn't say this is the BEST place to get breakfast downtown, but it is very good and fairly inexpensive, so I would definitely come here again.
3	Came here after a day of wild flower hunting in the Superstitions- it was a Wed. so all of us ordered the baby back bbq rib special.  Not especially memorable.  What I did like was the cole slaw made from purple cabbage and vinegar with some black pepper.  No mayo, extremely light, healthy and delicious.  The cole slaw was the saving grace.  This place was so unmemorable to me that I forgot the name of the restaurant and had to do a search for bbq in Chandler.  When I can't remember the name of a restaurant, that tells it all
3	The original concept of this restaurant is actually interesting (noodle dishes from all over the world) and sound great on the website, that is until you actually go to the place.  They have only a few options and seem to have lost touch with the original motives.\n\nThe manager informed us that they were trying to make the restaurant faster and easier, which makes a little sense...still, it was mildly disappointing, especially since they're only shortening the menu for us Arizonans and Californians.  What, they don't think we have a wide palate?\n\nThe updated mac and cheese wasn't anything special, actually it was a little too spicy, I noticed I wasn't the only one with a runny nose pushing the plate away after a few bites.  You couldn't even taste the cheese, if you can believe that.  The Thai curry was pretty good, but still....eh.  The nice thing was the manager offered to change the mac and cheese after seeing the bowl still full.  It was replaced with lemon pepper pasta, a nice fresh clean pasta, but still kind of ordinary.  The wonton smores were a little too sweet, but interesting idea.\n\nSo I won't be running over excitedly next time, but all in all it's an okay place, prices are pretty cheap starting at $4.99 for a decent portion.
5	"""I love you Carly. Are you single? \n\nAnyways, enough with the creepiness but I really do love this place. After my first meal here which consisted of hummus, two dirty martinis and the Ex-Patriot Sandwich on a Saturday at 4, I blurted out, \Hmmm......I wonder if there is a way that I can move in here.\"""" Which was a problem for two reasons. 1) My best friend was in the middle of an emotional breakdown because of her boyfriend and she could tell that I was really not listening and 2) I was serious. I lived in New York for a while and sitting in Carly's on a Friday night, with the live music, all the scarves and the skyline almost made me feel like I was in Soho, and that made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I also love Carly's because they serve their beer in adorable glasses and give a full presentation when serving absinthe as well. And Chimay. They serve Chimay. I had never had it before but now, I love it!!! Thanks Carly!!! Also, Stella on draft?!?!?! MMMMMMMMM so refreshing. It's as thirst quenching as Gatorade. Aside from the alcohol, I order something different every time I eat and I have never been disappointed. Yay Carly's!!!"""""""
5	Even when the Coffee Plantation was there, the Biltmore FP was not a place to get a decent coffee. Then, with even the lackluster  Plantation gone, mall employees and visitors alike were left with only Borders and Paradise (*shudders*).\n\nRoyal is such a wonderful and welcome addition to the Biltmore area. The use of the lobby space leading into the Red Door Spa is very clever, and the coffee bar and seating area itself are typical of Haye's talent for mixing design and functionality. It is the real deal and I look forward to drinking gallons of their delicious brews over the coming years.  \n\nRoast on, Royal.
1	"""I would give less stars if I could. Came here several times and seemed okay, but in the last two trips I have found hair and a sharp piece of metal (I was told was from a cleaning bristle - yuck!) in my ramen. Totally grossed out and terrified of how much it would hurt to ingest metal like that. Never returning and advise that they are seriously looked into by the health department. Even more aggravating, the lady just said \sorry guys\"""" to the last problem with our order - no refund. Horrible place."""""""
4	I like this bar alot. The drinks are cheap for the area, not watery and the shenanigans are HILARIOUS!  Drunk kids making out, hands on asses, under skirts- you name it. Of course you have to come after 11pm. I find the men are generally attractive but are sporting the hideous khaki's and flip flops- please with the damn flip flops!!!  Do you think you are Jimmy Buffett?\nOne thing to remember is there is half of the place without a roof, safe in Scottsdale one might say----Wrong!  The first time I went it rained all over my flip flops!
5	Great espresso, amazing service.  Sparse atmosphere but who cares when the coffee is this good.  Order a double espresso.  You will NOT be disappointed.  It is literally half the volume of a 'normal' double espresso (served in a single shot espresso glass) but QUALITY WAAAAAAAAAAAAY over Quantity baby.\n\nUpdate - as it turns out, they don't deliver downtown except for large orders.  Also, the phone # listed on Yelp gets you Tempe.  Hard to track down # for downtown location.  Really hope you start delivering lunch.
5	I love the PITT. I have never been the type of person who works out or played sports, but I finally had to give in and get in shape. I have been going to the PITT since December and I have lost 20 pounds and have been finding muscles I didn't even know i had! The trainers are great and extremely encouraging no matter what your athletic ability is. The workouts are never the same and they are always challenging (in a good way). I never get bored with what we are doing and love the atmosphere. I would recommend the PITT to any person who is ready to be committed to a workout routine and wants to see results.
3	This place was cool, but not as novel as I was expecting. \n\nA browser's paradise for sure, there is no shortage of interesting things to see, but it's not really some place I would go to to go shopping what with $100 throw pillows and other such equivalently priced/useful accoutrements. \n\nAnother reviewer compared this place to our unfortunately deceased Jutenhoops and let me tell you it is nothing of the sort.\nIt's cool to check out initially, but not really worth a trip back.
4	"""All chicken dinners should start out with a side of waffle, don't you think?\n\nA group of us went to Lo Lo's on Saturday night before the opening of Arizona Theatre Company's AIN'T MISBEHAVIN'. We figured dining on soul food would be a great precursor to the amazing music of \Fats\"""" Waller. \n\nThe service was super-quick (although, it WAS quite early. We were there at 5:30 PM). Our friends who are regulars recommended spouses sharing the Soul Food Platter. I thought that was a good idea, but my husband said, \""""Next time, I'm getting my own!\"""" \n\nWe started off with a waffle - yum - and then got our fried chicken (which I never, ever have, so that was a real treat), grits, cornbread, and mac & cheese. \n\nOK, this is bad ... I'm getting hungry thinking about our food from last night. I think that's a sign that we will need to return sometime soon. \n\nA note about credit cards: They informed us that they would not accept more than 2 transactions per party, which was good to know. Luckily, most people had cash, so we only had to have them run one card. Just be aware, as people are so used to handing over multiple credit/debit cards these days."""""""
2	We decided to go there for lunch as my wife had a work outing there and enjoyed the food.  The restaurant was less than a quarter full and the waitress was friendly.  The food was decent (calimari, lobster bisque and salads) and the portion sizes were fine.  I was just puzzled why it would take over 30 minutes to receive our salad orders and soup.  Since the restaurant was empty I did not expect to wait that long for a rather simple order.  We then had to wait over 15 minutes to pay.  My final impression of my experience was having 3 hostesses (or waitresses) hanging out by the front door gossiping and ignoring me.
4	My pup, Olive and I love to go to this dog park.  I think my favorite part about this dog park is the fact that they have the regular dog park, that has a cool obstacle course, and then they have a separate section for little dogs only.  It's great because Olive is a small, 12-pound, Papipoo and gets a little intimidated by bigger dogs.  She loves to run in the grass and play with other dogs.  I can tell she really enjoys herself.\n\nThe people that take their dogs here are also usually very friendly and everybody has a good time.
4	"""(Catching up on reviews from my last trip to Phoenix Oct. 19-22)\n\nThis salon is the epitome of a Senior Citizen salon. Yes, it is Sun City, so I wouldn't expect any differently, and their hours cater to seniors-open 8am-4pm M-Sat. It is a cash/check type only place and there is a nail salon connected to the shop as well.\n\nWhy am I writing a review for this place? Well, this is my Grandma's hair salon and she has a weekly appointment here. If I am in town when she has her appointment, I take her. I think I have taken her here 3 times now (twice this year) and have seen her hair after an appointment more times than I can count. They do \old lady hair\"""" and they do it just fine for a reasonable price. Her beautician is very nice and low key.\n\nThe real reason I wanted to write a review for this place is that in late July, the appointment my Grandma had here saved her life. How? Well, there were two retired nurses getting their hair done at the same time and they noticed a wound on my Grandmother's ankle. My Grandma had a biopsy taken earlier in the week on a possible skin cancer and sure enough, it turned out to become infected with MRSA and landed her in the hospital for a week and in a rehabilitation center for 3 more. \n\nOld lady hair do's or not, my Grandma is treated right here and at 88, here is where she will be every Saturday at 1pm."""""""
3	Grimaldi's is good pizza. It's not the best I've ever had, nor the worst. It is somewhere in between and unfortunately, that's why I can only give it three stars. We used to come here all the time until two things happened. 1) a pizza chain that will remain unnamed finally opened up shop and started delivering to our neck of the woods, and 2) we discovered a gourmet, organic pizza restaurant that really delivers the flavor I was hoping to find at Grimaldi's. I'm sure I'll be back given the proximity to my home, but maybe I'll try the calzone.
2	"""Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of burgers, or maybe my expectations were just too high... The burger I had here was good, the chicken sandwich was pretty good too. The frozen custard... well.. I've never had frozen custard before, so maybe it was the best, but I didn't think it was any better than an original dairy queen soft serve. The service is rude, in my opinion. It was my first time and they asked what I wanted, so of course, to be easy I say \however it comes\"""" and the response was in a better-than-you, teenage burger snob tone: \""""well, they COME plain, so you want it plain?\"""" ummm... no. \""""okay, then I'll take everything\"""" \""""so you want pickles?\"""" \""""yes\"""" \""""mustard and ketchup\"""" \""""yes\"""" well, if I wanted to do it that way I would have asked you to name off the ingredients... The fries were great and the chili fries were really great, but they still don't hold a candle to my childhood fave- Weinerschnitzels chili fries.. mmm...."""""""
5	I almost feel like I am cheating, but as someone who has been going to YC's for 15 years, and has done her best to stay true to them as their veggies got limp, the floors got dirty, and the staff got sweatier, I just can't do it anymore, not with this hot new Mongolian Grill around the corner. This place takes it to a whole new level, and its so clean, and so many options, nothing can compete...then you throw a $2 pint happy hour special in there and yeah, sorry YCs...can we still be friends?
5	Thai Basil has an cozy indoor dining area and a modest outdoor dining area. The place was beautifuI, neat and clean. I found the inside of the restaurant a bit over done with their ornaments, especially with the small statues  all placed around their bar near the cash register, but the picture frames with the elephants and buddhas were tastefully placed around the dining tables. The bamboo blinds were a very good addition to the ambiance. I especially liked the color of the tables and chairs, a kind of warm brown....\n\nThe dishes took long to arrive, but probably because there were a lot of us who were ordering. The waitress did her job well and was very informative on what dishes we should try next. The refill of our glasses were very prompt and even early...my glass was only three-fourths full and she would come and refill it right away. The waitress was always smiling and in good spirits. Great service.\n\nWe ordered 4 dishes - spicy noodles, chow mien, Thai basil, and silver noodles. They were all pretty good and tasty! I liked the spicy noodles the best! It had a light savory sauce and the saltiness was just right. The silver noodles with black bean sauce was a bit salty for me but it was delicious all the same. Thai basil was served with rice, it was also good but I'm not very fond of anise flavor. We had the Thai Basil in mild and we later found out it was better if it were a lot more spicier.  \n\nThe chow mien was delightful, it was my second favorite among the four. It had a thick spicy sauce and crunchy vegetables. All the dishes with their noodles and vegetables were cooked just right and their noodles were a bit chewy at first but when it cooled down a bit, it was soft and yummy...I like mine chewy though. =) Every thing really smelled good!\n\nIt was a great dining experience. I loved the hospitality mints...they were soft and melted in your mouth.
4	"""It's a Saturday night and I just got back from a late-night dinner at Bonfire, and I have to say I loved it!\n\nThe service wasn't ultra quick, but, if I want super-fast \turn-em-over\"""" service, I'll go to PF Changs.  I go to more upscale restaurants for a nice, relaxed meal with delicious food, and that is exactly what we got.  And the server was knowledgeable, friendly, and offered options.  Granted it wasn't very busy, so they weren't understaffed for the crowd and no one was over-loaded, but if I had been in a hurry I would have inquired before sitting down if that could be accommodated.\n\nWe ordered the chopped salad, the chilled roasted tomato soup, the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin & pineapple skewer, the mac & cheese, and the charred onion bread pudding.  All were fabulous.  Especially the roasted tomatoes and bacon in the the salad and the onion bread pudding.\n\nThe portions were all quite large too.  We shared everything, and were glad we did - especially the soup and salad.  Both were delicious, but the soup was rich, and thick, and much heartier than we expected (especially for a chilled soup,) so it would have been too filling if either of us had tried to eat it all on our own.\n\nAs for some of the bad reviews, there is one thing I've learned over the years:\n\nDon't go to a new restaurant, within three months of opening, and expect to have a fabulous dining experience.  If you do, great, you lucked out, and if you don't, it is not necessarily indicative of the restaurant's real potential."""""""
1	Hot chicks and stiff drinks. An outside bar where you can smoke. What could be bad about this? \n\nThe service sucks. \n\nFor the second time in 3 weeks I went in with a buddy and could not get anyone to serve us. We flagged one one of the many waitresses and asked for a menu. We never were asked for an order. For the 2 beers we did get we had to go to the bar and get them our selves. \n\nSunday morning I talked to a friend who had been in Wednesday night and got the same type of treatment. This place does not deserve your business, especially at $6. a pint.
5	First a note, avoid during First Friday! Now I say that for two reasons. First, because it's overflowing with art-walkers, and not just kind of overflowing, I'm talking like Rush Limbaugh in an extra small halter top overflowing (uhuh, shutters). Also, maybe if enough people stop going I can start going. Feh I can wish can't I.\n\nOn all other nights it's perfect. Only bottled beer and wine by the glass/bottle so be aware no mixed drinks. Still though that shouldn't deter anyone. The house is a little hard to find but that just adds to the quaintness. The crowd is really laid back and age ranges vary which I like. It makes for better people watching. No Dos Gringos bruhs in Affliction shirts.\n\nThey have some neat niche beers and are usually throwing something new and different into the mix. The bartenders are nice and the prices are very fair. The music selection is good, no top 40 stuff. The atmosphere is nice and dark with exposed brick walls and good art from local artists.\n\nSide note: There's a lock up area for bikes in front although it's limited, it's nice if you live in the area and want to bike for beers.
3	"""I don't have any problem with this place. Good amount of variety. Cheap. Fast. Friendly. Fresh. All the other adjectives used by previous reviewers. Plus, the kids meal \toy\"""" is actually an educational pull-out book which my 4-year-old is now delightly thumbing through on the sofa, as opposed to made-in-China rockem-sockem-robots or dragons that spit out flying plastic bullets like what you get from McDonalds. Oh, and I haven't gotten food poisoning from it (unlike from Chino Bandido, Macayos, Taco del Mar etc). Not exactly healthy food, though, so it's rare that I eat here. Kid loves the \""""reetos\"""" when we do go."""""""
4	I frequent this location the most, but during softball/kickball season we are at Camelback location more often. Both rate about the same in my book as far as service and food is concerned.\n\nWe always get the veggie burger which comes with fries or onion rings for only $5.95. The veggie burger is always good, for a non veggie restaurant(sports bar at that) it's damn good. They usually have decent beer specials and some games on as well.\n\n Sometimes the crowd at this location is strange, I can't figure it out. Mix of douche-bags, Scottsdale moms and kids - def too many kids. Camelback location has a better crowd and patio by far.\n\nThis location is 3 stars for me but it gets four because it is a sports bar with a fine veggie burger for less then $6.
4	My Big Fat Greek Express inhabits the spot previously taken by Saboten Grill and Kafe 440, both formerly owned by a nice couple and served great Japanese and Breakfast/Brunch food (respectably). Was happening to drive through Warner Rd at night when I saw some lights on in the vacant spot next to Picazzo's. Curious and excited (and a bit hungry), I pulled up and was surprised to see it was Greek food! Yay!\n\nThis place basically has the same items as the restaurant namesake but in a to-go format. The menu is extensive and includes stuff like Athenian Spaghetti, souvlaki dinner plates, several types of salads, sandwiches/burgers and hummus platters. The food is priced affordably for lunch, with pitas starting at $5. Dinners are a bit more per person. The woman on the cashier was very friendly and helpful. I got the spanakopita, a couple of pitas (gyro and beef souvlaki)  and a baklava. Yummy! The roasted lemon potatoes and rice that came with the spanakopita compliment the entree well. Although not authentically made, the baklava is dangerous...totally activated my sweet tooth monster ;)\n\nThere are also tables available for dining in as well as alcohol. Alcohol! Hooray for adult beverages! Will definitely be back to take advantage of that next time :)
5	Better be down to chow down!\n\nA super market and food extravaganza combined! While I don't come here for the super cheap produce or bags of laundry detergent, you can see me getting a large horchata at the juice bar, loading up on carne asada street tacos, getting a bowl of barbacoa, getting my ceviche on and finishing with tres leches cake. \n\nThe entire store is lined with a bakery, a juice bar, a giant bar of all the Mexican foods you can eat, a cheese store, a sausage place, a tortilleria, a fresh fish market where you can get seafood tacos and ceviche and a carniceria. \n\nWhile other are shopping, I'm busy eating and so are other people! There are clean tables inside the super market for you to get your food, cafeteria-style, and sit down to eat. There is a full bar of salsa and toppings near by. And if you want more food... go for it!\n\nIf you prefer a sit-down, they have a restaurant attached La Tradiciones that is also fantabulous! I hear they have a brunch that while is pricey, is worth the dolla dolla bills ya'll!
3	Food - 5-star\nVibe - 6-star\nDrinks - 5 star\nConcept - 10 star\nTypewriters as decor - 10 stars\n\nThe wait in line and fighting to find a seat to eat blows and Lux, you can do better.  Fellow Yelppers there is a line for a reason....it's mostly because the food is awesome but it's also because the set up is probably the most inefficient set up you could have.  This is a popular joint and if you have all the time in the world by all means....give Lux a shot.  However, if you only have 1.5 hours to kill for breakfast head here.\n\nLux, do your fans a favor and give us table service.  Don't make us wait in a 20 min line for a coffee refill.  I did not mind the wait on day 1 because you were new to me and your space is interesting. However, after 5 solid days of coming back for your crack I began to resent how much time I was wasting on my vacation.  I also had plenty of time to think of ways you could do crowd management differently.  \n\nI loved your DJ.
1	I hate that my first negative review had to be on a place where I expected so much more.\n\nI walked in to the shop, the front counter person was helping another customer. The customer was on her way out I stood LITERALLY in front of the counter looking at jewelry and not a single greeting. I proceeded to walk around the front area for a few minutes...still nothing. I went into the next room of product and looked at everything. I already had my eye set on a few things. I walked up towards the front counter area and another employee comes walking up, looked directly at me, and said nothing. She did however get into a conversation with the person behind the counter. Very chatty. Perhaps you should be more chatty with your customers. Here is a tip for you Frances people, if you want customers to actually buy things from you and return to your shop, GREET THEM! You both deserve a fish to go with that chip on your shoulder.
4	"""Great service despite there being 30 of us in our group, so I was impressed at how hard and efficient the staff was.\nNow, the food:  At happy hour get the wings.  Trust me:  get the wings.\nSucculent and good.\nThe nachos were plentiful IF you are into lots of that yellow processed \cheese\"""" crap they put on hot dogs at the cruddy movie theatres..yuk!\nIn fact, we ordered the plain nachos with no meat.  Biiiiiiig mistake.\nYou get tons of multi-colored tortilla chips, yellow good called \""""cheese\"""", a side order of sour cream that was pretty big, a bun of sliced raw jalapeno if you want your butt to hurt for days after eating it and some guacamole...which would have been okay if the avocado was ripe and not hard still..sigh.  The nachos are a loser.  Avoid them.\nSee why I said:  get the wings!  You get a big portion of slightly hot wings, a bunch of veggies like celery and carrots (Mom will be happy to see you eat your veggies) and some sauce with hot sauce in it.  The sauce, to me, was okay but could be better.  But, overall, this dish is a winner.\nDrinks?  I have no clue cause I was drinking beer, but I will assume they are okay since I hard no complaints.\nNice place, tho.  I'll be back for sure.  \nAnd happy hour is a great deal!!!!"""""""
4	Revo is such a great place, both for the atmosphere and the food. The rice is nothing short of pure perfection. I ordered the Combo on accident once, rather than just the burrito, and I was simply blown away. It is definitely something to savor! The black beans are not anything special unfortunately, but they are a good addition to the chips and yummy poured over a burrito. The salsa is just as amazing as the rice. I love southwest/mexican food, and have been to numerous places that serve salsa. There is something different about the salsa at Revo that gives it a boost above the rest for me and my roommate. We both HIGHLY reccomend it. I have the hot and he orders pico. We both LOVE everything we have had at Revo, except for the average black beans. Nevertheless, they serve as a good addition when eaten on the burrito. I would give our and a half stars if possible.
3	Good food, pass on the staff attitude.  We ordered the Chicago stuffed pizza on Sunday evening.  The waiter pushed us to order an appetizer or salad and this was after we asked for suggestions on the 10 or 12 inches.  After suggesting what size he thought I could handle, even though there was two of us at the table, we went with the ten.  Apparently I can handle ten with no problem?  Not sure what he was referring to on the size, it seemed like a pointed comment with innuendo towards myself.  He told us it would be 40-45 minutes.  After a nice conversation, with my friend at the table, we asked on the time as it seemed like it had been at least 45 minutes.  When we asked the waiter then quoted I stated it would be up to an hour.  Hmm, 15 minute grace period?  My friend being a Taurus, fired at him to check on the status.  He then came out and told me it was almost ready.  He then brought it out and quoted the time it took 49 minutes.  Food was great, I learned a lesson in time and apparently sizes.  I'm hoping he was not a representation of the staff as I'll pass on that.
2	"""I got hungry out on errands this morning & stopped in here for some breakfast.  The service was Poor with a capital \P\"""" & the food was weak, too!\n\nWhen I came in, the cashier pointed me to an ok booth, but it was a while before my loud waitress, who had brushed by my table several times, finally took my order.  After that, she disappeared.  (Did she quit?)  Anyhow, someone else eventually brought out my food.\n\nI had a \""""Grand Slam\"""" which used to be good, but 3 of the 4 items with this one were with this little tasteless hockey puck thing they called a \""""Chicken Sausage Patty\"""", a little serving of hash browns the size I would give my cat, & two (small?) eggs.  The 2 pancakes were ok, but could have used more syrup.  A second napkin would have been nice too, but there was no one to ask for it.\n\nDenny's (aka \""""Jenny's\"""") here might be fun late at night, but it's a dud at 10 in the morning!     :-O"""""""
4	"""Everyone knows you don't want to eat food at a place where nobody from that culture eats, so it is a good sign when you see a lot of Mexican folks eating at a place during lunch. On an odd side not I was just debating between saying \Mexican\"""" or \""""Hispanic\"""" I went with Mexican since I am reviewing a Mexican restaurant not a Hispanic one, (in case someone P.C douche wanted to crawl up my arse) \n\nI have only eaten one thing here and I have eaten it repeatedly. The Breakfast burrito hits all the right marks, huge, cheap and delicious. For $4.25 after tax you get what I am thinking is about a pound of breakfast food, freshly made (sometimes you have to wait a bit) wrapped in a tortilla. I get this in the morning a few times a week and don't feel like eating again until about 4 pm. If you are looking for a good cheap breakfast I would try this place out for sure. I haven't tried anything else yet but I did get an up close look at my coworkers lunch and it too was huge and looked amazing. I sent a customer to them the other day who was looking for a place to eat and when he came back he raved about his burrito. ."""""""

And now, to thank them for matching me with such great critters, I volunteer my time walking dogs for them, since they have no central facility. Most of their animals reside in volunteer foster homes and leased boarding facilities.\n\nTheir matchmaking process is superb - they are truly committed to finding the perfect home for each animal."""""""
5	BEST PLACE EVER!!! This is the best happy hour I have ever been to!  I try to go at least a couple of times a month.  Half price drinks and carafes of sake, rolls, and appetizers.  \nThe chicken gyoza is amazing, and I always get two orders for myself.  It comes with a chipotle aioli, but I always add a little Sriracha.  Their specialty rolls are delicious, and they have the most creative names like Dragonball and Bye Bye Kitty.  The sake flavors are always changing.  Some of my favorites have been pumpkin (seasonal), spicy mango, pineapple, and pomegranate.  Another fantastic draw for me to this place is that their happy hour is 7 days a week and is a nice 4 hours long.  Some places do a lame 2 hour happy hour and your rushing to get there, and make it on time.  I can't say enough good things about this place.
1	I was taking a tour of this complex, and I literally saw two mice run out of the bushes...not that big of a deal I guess, but that's just the beginning. I felt like I was on a used car lot, apparently they are desperate for people to move in, the person giving the tour kept trying to hard close me on signing that day. I overheard a couple arguing, and one of them threatened to kill the other...this place looks nice on the outside, but it's straight ghetto inside. Needless to say i did not sign a lease.
1	"""The Yard House is the Reggie Bush of Phoenix establishments.  O-ver-rated.\n\nUndeserving of accolades, superficially interesting, won't stand the test of time, all sizzle - no steak.\n\nI mean, what can one expect from a corny chain, where one is overwhelmed by Disney-fied cake and ale?  This place couldn't be less lame if they renamed it Chotchkie's and served Extreme Fajitas.  Actually, I'm shocked that they don't.\n\nOkay, okay.  I like beer.  They've got it.  But where is their sincerity?  They couldn't give a squirt of piss that they are serving rare Belgian pilsner.  I'm supposed to feel okay about this?  I need authenticity when I'm at a bar.  This is why so many Ultras in Scottsdale or LA or wherever fail with me, the dearth of convincing clientele, staff, and moreover, product.  Don't shit on my pillow and tell me its a little piece of chocolate.\n\nOverall, this is a genuine 1-star rating ... not one of those mealy-mouthed \oh, i wanted to give it LESS but I couldn't!\"""" reviews.  Go grab a beer here, but don't expect anything more than a bridled time with the fancypants of Fashion Square Mall.  \n\nP.S. One time I saw a guy valet his yellow Testerossa here and got out like he ran shit ... until minutes later the exact same model pulled into the valet area right behind him.  Ha!  Nice rental, watermelon balls."""""""
2	I have been to this place for drinks and possibly food over a year ago. It was time to stop by for a casual dinner. I was eating light this night so ordered a salad which said : field greens, apple, berry, fresh mozzarella, and I added chicken. This dish was an embarrassment to salads. Hardly any greens, maybe half a chix breast, and mozzarella u could barely notice. \n\nHusband had chix parm: nice size dish he liked it. \n\nThis is a cool place to have a drink but the food NO WAY. It is not memorable and there are too many other food places close by.
4	I live 5 minutes away from Ah-So and love having a good sushi place so close to home!  I usually just sit at the bar and order sushi but the fish is fresh and the bartenders are friendly and give good service.  \n\nThe atmosphere is perfect for hanging out with friends over the deliciousness that is a yellow tail and scallion roll and a couple of cocktails after a long day at work. \n\nWould have made five starts if you could ever find a place to park... Seriously poor planning.
2	Service was great. They replaced our ginger spice cocktail coz we cudnt take the strong flavor (although we were Indians used to spices). That was sweet of them. \nOverall, after a big bill, We didn't like this at all. Mostly Food was dry and could use some flavor.  Honestly we won't go back. True food kitchen was way better in terms of taste. \nMediterranean patti was too dry, Tuscan chicken sandwich was dry too. Sweet potato air fried chips were great. Kale salad was good too.
1	"""I am done with the Armitage. I have been here several times over the past few years and other than being overpriced, the food and service was always good. \n\nA couple of months ago, we went there for a birthday lunch. I ordered the Garden Veggie Pita. How can one mess up a veggie sandwich? How about putting it on a stale pita bread that cracks in two when you pick it up. Since it was my B-Day I didn't want to make any comments, especially since I wasn't the one paying. \n\nA couple of weeks ago we went there on a Sunday. I ordered the beef and Gorgonzola melt and my partner ordered a burger medium rare. When the plates were delivered I noticed that the slices of sirloin resembled small chunky pieces of beef jerky, the mushrooms were dry and shriveled and the Gorgonzola melt part looked like a wipe of mayo. I have had this before and the sirloin was always juicy and tender, on the medium rare side. I brought this to the servers attention who immediately said \that's how it's made.\"""" I told him that I've had it before and it definitely did not resemble my prior visits. No comment from the server. I ate it since at that point I didn't want to make a scene and it was horrid. My partner's \""""medium-well\"""" burger was very well done. She decided not to complain due to the fact that we don't really see what goes on in kitchens when we complain, do we? We didn't have an opportunity to even let the server know we were disappointed, since we didn't see him until the end of the meal. At that point, we made it clear that we were very disappointed, and showed him the doneness of the burger. I reiterated how horrible the beef jerky sandwich was and he then offered to comp. We settled on a free dessert. He also gave us coupons which was a nice gesture. Too bad he didn't listen to me the first time... \n\nTo the owner: when a repeat customer says he had something before, and that there is now something wrong, have your people pay attention. Don't make excuses for an incompetent kitchen. However, based on what your staff said, IF it is now your intention to provide an overdone dried out sliced sirloin sandwich, and  to overcook burgers regardless of the order, then you have no business in the food business. If not, then you better get in that kitchen and fix it, because this sort of news travels fast in my community. \n\nIn my book, two strikes and you are out. Sorry but there are better choices out there, and if I am going to spend 100 bucks on lunch it better be damn good. You're just not good anymore. I will not be back."""""""
4	Recently scored two cruisers on Craig's list or Ebay or one of those internet sites I hardly use because I feel like I am going to get murdered.\n\nNow I can relive my childhood and ride bikes around Scottsdale.  Only problem is I haven't actually been on a bike since childhood.  Yes, I totally biffed it on a curb my first time out.\n\nThis is why I only give the green belt 4 stars.  Way too many people walking in fours and fives along the path and they never get out of your way.  They literally just stand there.  Does no one have any damn manners?  I have to slow down to a stop and say excuse me three times before someone pays attention.  I'm getting a horn installed on my cruiser.  Contrary to the way I sound I am actually quite courteous.  It's just that I suck and may fall into you if you refuse to get out of my way.  \n\nI highly enjoy the green belt.  Riding my cruiser through the shade of large trees, dodging ducks and dogs, and feeling the cool breeze of the springtime makes me feel like I'm in Southern California.  The green belt makes me happy.  Literally, it's a natural mood enhancer.
3	Gotta love the amount of food you get for under $10. Their sides are hit or miss: the macaroni salad is well-made with a good amount of black pepper, the kimchee isn't bad if you like that sort of thing, and the rest are just watery veggies or  noodles. The bbq chicken tastes great to me, and isn't too oily like other's I've had.\n\nTheir service is pretty good, my only issue is that they aren't that friendly. I used to be somewhat of a regular here, but the lack of friendliness from a family-owned place keeps me from going as much.
1	"""So this place literally ruined Christmas for us. My wife and Iare  from CA and we miss having Roast Duck. We have always heard how great this place is and have always wanted to try it out. I called a few days before Christmas to see if they were opened on Christmas/Christmas Eve, and they were! Great, so I asked if they sold Roast Duck which they did, and had asked how early I should place my order since I wasn't sure if they would run out. They had told me that they would have it and would only need to order it 25-30 min in advanced. So we call today, which I believe was the same person I had talked to the other day, and they said they don't serve Roast Duck, and that they only serve off their \Special Christmas\"""" menu. We were absolutely furious. We will never go here, regardless whether or not the food is good."""""""
3	The food here was pretty good as was the location. Wow! I did not have any expectations of Scottsdale before my recent trip and all the locations amazed me. This was probably one of my favorites. It is located in such a hip and fun shopping/dining area. The service was not good. We had 1 waitress for 20 people. The manager did comp us for the trouble but it took us 4 hours to eat. The happy hour specials are great!
1	"""Horrible service.  We had waited 45 minutes and still didn't have our food. The table next to us came in 20 minutes after us, ate their food, and left.  At one point the server brought us our drinks and said \let me go put down my tray and I will come right back to take your order\"""".  It took her 15 minutes to put down her tray.  She also said \""""sorry your food isn't up yet, we had a large table ahead of yours\"""", she was saying this as another table next to us, who had ordered after us was receiving their food.  I am sure she took our order and had to \""""put down her tray\"""" before she sent the order to the kitchen.  We left without eating."""""""
5	"""I find it only appropriate I make Sabor Cubano my first review.

My  Grandmas food is an 10, Moms is a 9.. this place an 8.\n\nThe servers, possibly daughter/relatives  of the owners are all  Cuban and friendly.  The food is all there.. there is no staple in Cuban food  missing.   All of the carb and protien overload you can hope fore. The plantano fritos and platanos maduros have to be ordered off the menu and will set you back about another  5 bucks total, but have them.  Any traditional cuban meal is eaten with a side of sweet of fried plantains.  Try the \""""Materva\"""" while you're there.  A Cuban soft Drink made of \""""Mate root\"""" and of course// finish your meal off with a \""""cafecito cubano\"""" (cuban coffee), she'll confirm your order as an \""""Espresso\"""" so that you are aware its a small strong shot.\n\nI applaud this place for thier genuitiy and effort.

4	A great walk, with superb animals! The animal environments are very clean, and the inhabitants seem very happy with their man made homes. \n\nIf you happen to be in Phoenix during December or early January, make it a point to go check out the Zoo Lights. Weather will be much cooler then the summer months, and the lighting displays are really inventive and appealing. \n\nOverall, this zoo is one of the better ones I've been to, and doesn't disappoint on any level.
3	I'd like to start by saying that I wish I could give this place 3 and a half stars. If you read my other reviews I'd love to point out this place is notably better than many of the 3 star places I have reviewed. \n\nLe Chalet is an amazing place for newcomers to swiss food. The fondue is great but the best things come from their unique cultural dishes like the savory crepes & wraps. Throw away what you know about crepes and wraps and begin to rebuild here. The La Potence one of their signature dishes looks a bit gimmicky but they pull it off well. Its paired with a bunch of different sauces, some better than others but overall very satisfying. Dessert is a no brainer, the sweet crepes will deliver on what your looking for.
5	A nouveau style of cuisines, Chaka Chaka is a simple restaurant that blends the flavors and textures of Caribbean, New Orleans, and Latin American styles and runs with it. Just go and try the jerk chicken and banana sandwich. Or the egg and chorizo sandwich or their black bean soup or their fried rice. All I can say is that I've eaten there almost a dozen times, and I always leave extremely satisfied. And all the sandwiches are $6 or less.\n\nChaka Chaka is an on-the-go type of place so you probably won't park yourself there for hours at a time. There's just a few counter table seats inside and some out-door seating and that's it. I highly recommend stopping by and sampling their various selections. I'm reasonably certain that after you do, you'll find yourself craving Chaka Chaka again before long and back there for a return visit. It's a real Phoenix treat!
3	Some good counter-style grub.  It's located with 99 Ranch, and the buffet is Panda Express-style by the way you place an order.  But it's sooo not Panda Express -style in taste.\n\nThey don't skimp on the noodles here, and the orange chicken comes with actual red chili peppers sans the typical orange goop.  Uh oh, stop the presses.  \n\nThey had whole chickens hanging in a heated glass case, just like they do in the Chinatowns of the nation.  Nice!!  \n\nPlus there were tons of dishes at the counter that I couldn't recognize - always a good sign of authenticity.  My only complaint was I thought the egg drop soup was a bit too raw and runny for my tastes.   But overall a good value for $4 and change.
2	Don't get me wrong the coffee is great and there are a few stellar baristas working here.  However, the majority of the workers here are just not coffee shop people. They are not friendly, they don't smile or say hello, or ask me what they can get started for me.  I walk up to the counter and they just look at me and wait for me to start talking.  I often don't feel welcomed and although the coffee is always good, I just don't enjoy my experience here and it is totally because of the employees.
3	"""Three words: Chedder Bay Biscuits. \n\n\You can put a color with any noun and make a restaurant,\"""" my youngest brother commented on the ride over. He sat in the very back of the Envoy. I was behind the driver, my father. It was a family affair - the first dinner together since my other brother had gotten in from leave. \n\n\""""Green French fry,\"""" the oldest of the two sons said. Ew. \n\nI understand that Red Lobster is a direct insult to anyone living on the coast - whether you're from Seattle or Boston. Trust me, I'm well aware how offensive this restaurant can be. Yet, consider the demographic of the diners - all of us from Kansas. Sure, I've been to the coast, eaten fresh fish in Boston and San Francisco. Red Lobster is not what I would consider \""""upscale dining.\"""" Yet, considering the alternatives, I was okay with the selection. After all, they had to have a decent beer, right? They did. I ordered a Blue Moon while my brothers chose mixed drinks. \n\nOur waiter, one gregarious Erock, was the life of the party... and he wasn't even family. I ordered his recommendation - the Cajun Salmon - and found myself barely picking at it. I had a few bites of broccoli, but mainly I was content munching on the biscuits and drinking my beer. My brother picked at his steak. I tried a bite. \""""Chew, chew, chew,\"""" he said as my teeth tried to tear the beef apart. \""""Bite 15 and you've lost all flavor.\"""" I nodded sympathetically. Most of my family enjoyed their meal, though I could tell there were a couple disappointed in parts of their entrees, like the rice. I boxed mine up to go, for my Dad had ordered the exact same thing and loved it. No reason in wasting food, you know? Besides, I like making sure mi padre is well fed. \n\nWe all left full. I think my meal consisted of 75% beer, 15% biscuits and 10% \""""real\"""" food."""""""
3	The latest review is bizarre. I think I stepped into a timewarp.\n\nCP IS CLOSED.\n\nGutted.\n\nI saw it with my own lying eyes just last week.\n\nHow was a review dated today written, as if it just happened?\n\nYou are now entering the twilight zone. Paging Rod Serling.\n\nOK enough dissing and drama. Rumor is they are moving to Town and Country at 20th st or so.\n\nI always liked it for the people watching. The coffee was always decent and always better than Charbucks. But since the Biltmore is turning into a giant epic fail as the businesses that had people coming back over and over are replaced with bad chains... ugh.  People watching at Town and Country isn't going to be the same.\n\nIt's the end of an era.
4	I really really really like OHSO.  I always feel a little odd reviewing a brewery since I don't drink beer, so I'll review the eatery part.  But let me say if I did like beer, I would love that you can buy small tastings before you commit.  Wouldn't it be great to be able to do that with anything?  \n\nFirst off, the menu is perfect with a handful of appetizers, small plates, salads, burgers, and sandwiches all for $10-$15.  The small plates are really not that small.  The shrimp tacos were really good as was the accompanying slaw.  The tortillas are street size, but you get a good half dozen or so.    I really loved the grilled chicken flatbread with plenty of cheese, bacon, garlic poblano sauce, and a cilantro pesto.  If you're not a fan of cilantro, it is almost undetectable.  I also wish the poblano sauce were a little spicier.  But what makes this flatbread is the chopped tomato and cucumber salad on top.  It adds a nice sweetness and freshness to the pie.  Without it, the dish would fall a little flat to me.  And whatever you get, add french fries.  Thin and crispy with a sprinkling of black pepper.  Mmm.  Mmm.\n\nIt's never been busy on my visits, but I've only gone for weekend lunches.  Hopefully they stick around for a while.
5	This place is incredible. The atmosphere, the wine & beer, the service, and above all else the food. It is a tad pricey but worth every penny and more. GREAT date night spot, great place to get together with a group of friends, great for appetizers, just dessert, wine, anything you can think of. I definitely plan on showcasing this place whenever friends or family come into town. \n\nIf there is a large group make sure and call ahead for reservations because it is a small dining room and it does fill up!!
4	"""A little embarrassed to say, but I like this place! It's like Famous Footware, Shoe Pavilion (didn't SP go out of business?) or a small DSW. \n\nBrand names shoes for less! Gotta love that. \nI'm surprised the prices are less than DSW or similar places. And they have the \buy 1, get 1 half off\"""" sales. \n\nI really enjoyed shopping in here. The variety of shoes are all great. At least 1 member of the family will walk out with a pair of shoes that they'll like. I bought 2 pairs of shoes (for the hubby and I) for only $50. We were really happy."""""""
5	Five stars for customer service - everyone at this resort is HELPFUL!  It is a beautiful place with every room, I believe, overlooking the golf course.  We always relax in these environments.  I think the beds here must be the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in, anywhere - so much so that I may buy the same brand for home.\n\nThe rooms are beautifully decorated and they have just what we needed for our relaxation.  There are lots of good restaurants nearby, although there's not a restaurant in operation at the resort itself.  We called a local delivery service one night, and frankly, that was a great meal.  We got to just relax and enjoy our room.\n\nI have to laugh at all the towels folded into swans - cute, but a lot of work for the staff.  We completely enjoyed ourselves and we will stay again.
1	"""First off, I'd like to mention that I've been in the salon industry for years, both in Los Angeles where I ran one of the best salons in the city for years, and here in Phoenix, where I helped a friend build another from the ground up. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. This place, unfortunately, exists in the final group.\n\nThe service was horrendous. The place appears to be run by a mother and daughter duo, who I can only assume had this project funded by \Daddy dearest,\"""" something evident in the lack of pride which went into the design and running of the place. The overall decor is tacky at best, with little care given to any of the details that separate a Salon from a Great Clips.\n\nThe product wasn't much better. The blow out I received was mediocre at best, especially compared to similar offerings in the area. The cost was standard, but definitely not worth the quality.\n\nI won't be returning."""""""
5	Formerly Bath Junkie, The Bath Workshop is my favorite and the ONLY place I will ever buy bath products again! They have forever changed the concept of bath products & I couldn't recommend them enough. \n\nFirst of all, a place that lets you totally customize your product is fabulous. You pick your product and then you choose your fragrance (up to a mixture of 4) and then choose the color of your product. But that's not what I love about them -- I love the actual product. All of their products do as they claim & I actually feel like it's good for my skin...I don't feel like I'm putting chemicals on top of my skin and THAT is what keeps me going back lovelies. Not to mention, it's a really cool store that is fun to bring friends and spend some time in. The store itself is really fresh, modern, and clean...just step inside & you'll see what I mean.\n\nSalt scrub? AMAZING. When I first walked in through their doors last summer I kind of rolled my eyes when they offered up a free salt scrub treatment -- who hasn't tried salt scrub?! I was so, so wrong. Their salt scrub feels so amazing & luxurious -- so many other places carry salt scrubs that are oily or just kind of 'ehhh' but this one exceeded my expectations. It's been a year & I've gone through about 5 of them! They are really THAT amazing.\n\nBody Dessert? MORE THAN AMAZING! I went in there about a month ago & they had changed the name of the body dessert -- I believe it's now called Body Finisher? Anyways, this is the spray lotion they put on your hands after the salt scrub treatment and it is seriously fabulous. You can put it on your skin wet or dry & they explain to you that when your pores are wet it soaks in moisture better and then you pat away excess that your body won't soak in anyway. It is SO NICE to have a lotion that is light-weight & leaves my skin feeling soft and clean, not oily and disgusting. I especially love it for summer when I don't want anything extra weighing me down. It's not made as a 'super moisturizer' so if you are looking for a deep moisturizing treatment this isn't it, but it is fabulous for everyday use and keeps your skin feeling fresh and lovely.\n\nI've tried & loved many other products in the store, but the two above are the ones that keep me coming back for constant refills. And that is coming from someone who usually takes a year or longer to go through a bottle of lotion from other stores!\n\nRemember how I mentioned you can customize your own scent? Yeah, that's FABULOUS. I have all kinds of different scents. My favorite go-to-pick-me-up scent during the summer is light & airy -- White Tea, Green Tea, Lime, and Aloe Vera. When I told the employee I wanted something really light & fresh, this is what she crafted. At first I thought it sounded like the most disgusting combination ever, but I absolutely love that light scent on my skin during warm summer days. They have so many scents that it can be overwhelming to create your own, so just talk to an employee about the kind of scent or mood you want to create & they will get the wheels rolling in no time. Another favorite classic of mine is White Tea & Peppermint. Love putting that in my salt scrub that I apply before night!\n\nPrices are a little more than you might expect, but trust me, it is SO worth it. You leave the store with something you truly love -- the color is something you chose, the scent is something you chose, and the actual product itself...well, that will speak for itself.\n\nStop waiting and go to Bath Junkie -- errr....The Bath Workshop -- NOW!
4	Be warned.  A trip to Lo-Lo's will shave precious minutes off of your life.  Ah, heck.  I'm not a health nut and if you're taking a gander at Lo-Lo's reviews, odds are, neither are you.  Take a ride on the unhealthy side and enjoy your meal.  \n\nThis morning marked my first visit to Lo-Lo's.  I wanted to hit up the original location south of downtown Phoenix but time dictated I opt for the closer location in Scottsdale.\n\nThe restaurant was of decent size and comfy.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Placed my order and it arrived quickly (easily within 15 minutes).  \n\nI ordered Sheedah's Special which consisted of a fried chicken breast & wing and a waffle and a side of grits.  For a beverage I ordered a Dr. Pepper and it arrived in a Kerr's canning jar.  Nice touch.\n\nThe waffle was unique and tasted of cinnamon.  The chicken was outstanding.  Seriously, it ranks as some of the best I've had.  Lo-Lo's should sell the chicken by the bucket.\n\nMy only gripe with Lo-Lo's is the ghetto glorification you'll see on the menu and the t-shirts.  A small annoyance that does not get in the way of the delicious food.
5	"""I had to write about the Orange Tree Golf Resort because I own a timeshare unit there.  I bought a unit in 1994, and back then, they were 1 of about 4 timeshares in Phoenix.  Now, it seems there are dozens of timeshares in the Phoenix area. Currently, the resort is in the porcess of upgrading all of the rooms, so if you book there, ask for an remodeled room.  I haven't seen the newly remodeled rooms, but based on the old style, the rooms are great.  The bigest complaint people seem to have about the rooms are the lack of a full kitchen.  But keep in mind, the Orange Tree was not built as timeshares, rather, it was a former hotel that went bankrupt. The old units had a \college sized\"""" refridgerator, but the remodeled units will have a full sized refridgerator and flat creen LCD TV. The bathroom is the best part of the units, with a two person water jet tub and a walk-in shower and television.  The resort is in a great location, just a few miles from downtown Scottsdale, or about a 20 minute drive to downtown Phoenix. The on-site restaurant and bar are great, and if you are a golfer, the course is fantastic."""""""
2	"""Palo is the equivalent of a late night booty call, but not a first or second tier candidate. I'm talking about that last resort option that you've never introduced to your friends and rarely carry on a conversation with outside of the bedroom. It's dark, raucous and everything is kind of hazy the next morning. The drinks are stiff and cheap, so you can get your drunk going strong and wake up the next morning with a pounding headache and mystery bruises. \n\nI used to come here all the time when I lived at the corner of Priest and Broadway because it was within walking distance and is the first bar to open on any given day. Ah, the memories. Usually relayed to me second hand. \n\nMy favorite thing about this place is the graffiti. Where else are you going to see a squatting naked chick crawling with the crabs, little claws clinging to all sorts of uncomfortable places? Well on the inside of the stall in the women's restroom is where. \n\nSeconded as, \the dive-iest of dive bars.\"""""""""""
1	If you are looking for a place to get acrylics done. This is not the place for you. I found this place because it was close ASU. I got a backfill for $32. It looks absolutely horrible. The colored tips take up over half my nail which makes it look ridiculous. After the first 3 nails were started I noticed how much area of my nail she was taking up with the purple glitter. I asked her to fix them and she refused saying she couldn't which is absurd because I know from my experience at other nail salons that it is possible to fix it especially in this early stage. Overall my nails are too sharp, have random bumps on them, and have glitter randomly in the pink fill area. Two of the nails she did not put enough glitter on the tips so the light literally shines through them. Also the line from where my nails had grown out from before is clearly visible on each nail. Places that charge a little more are definitely worth it considering I will likely have to get my nails redone because they are so bad. Do not trust Bella nails to do your acrylics.
4	OMG... I love this place! I'm not sure how long this place has been here but it's soooo awesome and the kicker is Z pizza is its neighbor and they are connected so you can grab a slice of pizza then go get ice cream or coffee or a latte. Simply fabulous for say a casual day time date the atmosphere is nostalgic and funky... oh and pink! Free wifi and cool tables and couches. Its places like this that are adding flavor to downtown phoenix where I just happen to live... Watch out mill avenue were coming for you in a bigger and better way!
5	I use to fly a lot but as the cost raises and terror took the skies I stopped. I however flew Alaska Airlines one way from Seattle to Phoenix to transport my beloved dog. They are still the best! Their pet transport fee is still the lowest when your pet travels at the same time you do. When I got to my seat there was a post-a-note saying I'm on board too! That reassured me, and others like me that our pet was on the plane. I thought that was such a sweet and thoughtful touch. Kudos Alaska Airline! I flew you also because many trips between Seattle and Alaska with my prior dog had been successful and horror free. You know how to take care of our fury members, as well as the rest of us and you do it at fairer fare than the others.\nYour cleaning staff is awesome after the flight they get in there and tidy things up for the next group, find and turn in our forgotten items like my L.G. Lotus phone and quickly get it to us before we leave the airport! When I went to claim my baggage and dog your porter took the work out of it by having all my belongings and my dog gathered and ready to go curbside for my pick up! The porter  checked to make sure my dog was mine and even minded my bags while I took my dog to the PHX doggie walk at the airport to relieve herself! All in all I felt I and my canine companion were looked out for like we were more than just a head count  from the start to the end of the trip. Further more all my belongings including my computer and camera equipment in my checked in baggage came to me undisturbed and undamaged. I thank you a thousand times for your kid gloves to my personal belongings and with my dog. I'll be flying with you again.
4	Don't be afraid to try the green eggs and ham. It is out of this world. \nT. Cooks is beautiful, with superb service and a wonderful menu. The desserts are design masterpieces. \nThe table bread is fresh and made every day. \nThere is certain to be something on the menu you will fall in love with. \nWhether you eat in the court yard, inside or on the patio, this place is perfect by yourself, with your sweat heart or a group. \nThe grounds at the Royal Palms are beautiful and you will feel like you are in Paradise.
5	"""If you have any time between now and May 31, 2009, be sure to go and check out the Chihuly installtion at the Desert Botanical Gardens.\n\nThe gardens would have been fabulous, but the Chihuly installion delivered icing to a tasty cake.  For fifteen bucks, it was one of the nicest walks I have taken in a long time.\n\nOn my sixth day in Phoenix, I decided to take a few hours from my hectic schedule of class during the day, getting lost on the way back to the hotel and working into the wee hours and see something of my weeklong adopted city.  Perusing those magazines left in the hotel room by the management (in a vain attempt to say, \Get of the room, sometimes, dearies, you work too hard!\"""")  I found an ad for the Chihuly exhibit, went online to buy a ticket and had my plans _made_.  I would have gone to the zoo, but it closes at five _everyday_.  The garden is open until nine, which gave me time to leave class, get lost driving there and still have some wandering around inside the garden time.\n\nOk, the temperature was 103 that day, so even in the early evening, it was pretty hot, but I  took water and there were fountains dispersed throughout the park.  Even iin the gloaming, I got a little sun, but I would definitely advise the strongest sunblock you can find.  \n\nThey were having an evening event with jazz and food and drinks, but as the park filled up with people, it didn't seem appreciatively more crowded, except in the food and drink areas.  This park is large enough to accommodate lots and lots of people. \n\nJust a note of the Chihuly glass.  This is a major installation.  I lost count as to how many pieces were here.  My brother wrote in my blog that this was where Chihuly pieces belonged, not indoors, in museums.  I respectfully disagrees, I love to see Chihuly pieces anywhere.  Surroundings do interact with his art, but wherever I see his work, it changes and grows.  Just as limiting Goldworthy's work to outdoors would only show us one side of that talented artist, limiting Chihuly's work to outdoor installations, would only show us a limited number of facets of his work. \n\nOk, I'll get off my soapbox now.  :::griN:::  \n\nI'll just say that if you have some spare minutes in Phoenix that are not in the heat of the noonday sun, go to the Desert Botanical Gardens, before May 31, if possible!"""""""
5	Finally I had a chance to check this place out for lunch.  I was intrigued to find a Scandinavian restaurant in town since I'm from Norwegian heritage.  I ordered the meatball sandwich with the potato salad which was really delicious!!  The place was clean, the service was friendly, and I love the fact that they have games to play while you eat.  Just a cute little Mom and Pop restaurant.  I can't wait to return and try out some different dishes.
4	"""I'd been itching to get to a local brewery during our most recent visit to the Phoenix area and Four Peaks had come highly recommended.  \n\nAs we rolled through the neighborhood, I was pleasantly happy to see that parking within a block of the brewery was going to be difficult.  This is a good sign of good things to come.\n\nThe day we visited the patio was packed, so I was a bit apprehensive about a \seat yourself\"""" sign upon entering.  But we were immediately greeted by a friendly server who promptly delivered our beer selections.  Oh man, I wanted to try one of everything, but I opted for the Apricot brew.  (Hopefully I'll get a chance to try the sampler during a future visit!)  We ordered the nachos to start, but got our entrees first.  I tried the grilled salmon wrap and was quite blown away!  I read that the food here was so-so, but I really enjoyed my meal.  My mom and sister also cleaned their plates, so it's safe to say we were thoroughly pleased with each of our selections.\n\nGreat food, great beer, and great service!  It might be a year or so, but I'm certainly looking forward to another visit to Four Peaks!  Now I'll have to see if I can find some of their brews here in Denver..."""""""
4	Cool and off beat yet close to everything.  \n\nI frequent Kazimierz about two - three times per year. I have never had a bad time here; I think it would be hard too.  It is in the heart of Old Town but somehow manages to not have the douche-bag clientele that goes with the area.  It is dimly lit and the decor is eclectic.  There is a map of the world made of pennies that is the backdrop for the live bands.  \n\nWhen I first moved to AZ 3 years ago I had my birthday party here and I decided to have my birthday here this year as well.  OK, well it was birthday 2012 part deux.  I had just returned from celebrating my birthday in Atlanta a couple of day before: See Nikko Bisto review.  \n\nWe had a reserved couch that was in perfect position to see the live band. To my surprise the band for the evening was Elvis Before Noon!  I love that band and Mr. Peabody, this to me was a great gift.  I say that because that was the first time they played at Kaz.  They sang happy birthday, the Beach boys version.  Fun. \n\nI gave 4 stars because our waitress was not very attentive.  Our bill was over $500 for about 5 or 6 people and she was not worth her tip at all.  We seemed to be in a miserable mood and was just not coming around enough and was not very good at presenting the food and drinks.  Also, I know she was not a sommelier but she was not too good at wine recommendations either.  Hey this is a WINE bar. \n\nAside from our server we had a great time here as usual.  They have a great wine menu as well as a full bar.  The food is really good.  They have a really good cheese board and anti-pasta.  The hummus is also very tasty as is the flatbread.  I think you get my point; it is all good.  Will be back soon.  \n\nM-

Since m-day's gift was so well received, it was only logical that I go back to Kohl's for a birthday gift.   I purchased a black leather purse for mom for her birthday and a gift card.  I got the purse at half off the original price, I love sales and Kohl's has plenty.  I do wonder  are the prices really sales? are the items marked up and then down to create a \fake sale\""""?

4	I think this place is great. It's a unique little spot. However, some of these reviews are expecting too much. First, you're going for a $10 wine tasting for five wines, you shouldn't expect Opus One. The wines are priced appropriately and the concept of bottling parties is such a great idea for an event. Also, 'carry & go' is a perfect idea in this area. \n\nThe wines are not offensive. If you are a wine connoisseur, then you will appreciate that these are young wines, but typically are pleasing to the palate. \n\nI have always found the staff to be extremely friendly. Also, I agree with Gabbi, that they get props for being doggie friendly!!
1	I agree with Susan , I saw a Huffy bike for $200 yesterday , a dress for $100 and yes, the prices are way over priced and the 2 employees never greet you , the girl is always on her phone. I would fire all employees and hire honest friendly ones. There is never any good items , I believe one or some of the employees is working with an outside source to sell the valuable items like fine jewelry and antiques , there is never these items . This place should be shut down for good. \n I hope God doesn't punish them for ripping people off and being money hungry.
4	I don't get why there are so many haters of Benihana! If you are looking for good teppanyaki japanese cooking, this is a very good place for it. I have tried many things here but you know what they don't get enough credit for? Their sushi! The Vegas roll at Benihana is the best vegas roll I have ever had and might actually be my favorite sushi roll ever! Now, onto their regular food, I have tried many menu items and all have been good. That includes: teriyaki steak, hibachi chicken, hibachi shrimp, spicy hibachi chicken, and colossal mango shrimp. However, the best dishes I ordered here in addition to their Vegas Roll are the yakisoba and the hibachi scallops. These are both delicious and some of the better values on the menu I felt. The fried rice is 1.25 more to add on and although tasty, I don't feel that its worth it to pay extra. It is fun to watch them make it though. Here's the weird thing: my favorite part of the meal (next to the Vegas roll) is their vegi's. The zucchini and onions taste sooo good with all the butter in them!!! Of course, everything is better with butter! Another good thing about the meals is you get soup and salad so you feel like the price is a little more reasonable. The soup is very brothy but has a great onion flavor to it. The salad on the other hand has a ginger dressing that I am not a fan of. All in all, benihana, although a little overpriced, has some terrific food and its a great place to take a date. The show the chefs put on it very fun, however, it doesnt change much from chef to chef if you have been more than once. Oh one other understated item: their tempura banana's for dessert. Delectable! Everyone should try Benihana and their dam Vegas Roll at least once in their lives. A final tip: If you expect great service, do not sit in the bar to have dinner. We made the mistake of doing that once and had to wait forever for everything! Sit at the tables if you are planning to have more than drinks. WORD!
3	I feel basically the same way as Stevey; one problem, we had a roach crawl across the table and behind the picture frame on the wall (although, it wasn't too bad... the picture was of a heavily mulleted Italian man circa 1981, though I see that being insult to injury to those less appreciative of bad 80's fashion) last time. BIG turn off. The man won't go there with me anymore. I can't find a better chocolate egg cream though...

4	People. People. Some of you negative nancys need to take a deep breath and stop complaining about getting charged 25 cents for using your credit card. Yelp reviews can make or break these local businesses, and small things like processing fees aren't a true representation of what a coffee shop experience should be about. Hava Java is a great independent coffee shop with great tasting coffee and tea. The baristas are on-point and very friendly. For the price you pay, you get a great beverage, and it doesn't taste anything like strbx. The 1 negative of this place is the lack of seating- it is a 'run and gun' coffee bar- and if I want to stay and read or do work, I go to Lux. Maybe make the outdoor seating more compact and expansive? I want more independent local businesses like Hava Java in my neighborhood, and I'm willing to pay a little extra for that- but they do give punch cards here so it all evens out and then some!

There can be a line out the door and only two people working the counter and they will never add an additional employee to the counter or work at any faster pace to move things along.

4	I'm still a big fan of the light rail! Sure, I can't use it every day, but it's about the only thing that will get me to head to downtown for a night out.  \n\nIt's perfect for pub crawls, you can gather a huge group, keep everyone more or less together, and make frequent stops.  The extended hours mean more time for drinking!\n\nThe trains have stayed clean, they run when they are supposed to, and I've never had a problem.  The people watching is awesome as well.  Each stop is a mystery grab bag of the teeming masses of people here in town. \n\nI just wish it had a wider range, I'd use it every day if I could.
5	"""Pretty cool place!! Helpful employees, no pressure to buy anything. Which is nice when you are a parent of 3 kids. The store at Downtown Disney is a bit pushy and hands a lot of things over to kids. Which turns into survival of the fittest when you have a kid who wants a $100 Lego set. True story. \n\nIt was nice that the employee came over and told my son to \fill the bucket until it won't close. We tape the top on\"""". My son was was afraid he was stealing if he took too many. Or that they would weigh the container like a salad bar! Not true either way. Chase was happy with his full to the top $7.95 bucket of Legos. I was happy... Until midnight hit and I was walking up the stairs in a Lego combat zone! Ouch! That review would be for my own house, not the Lego store!! \n\nOverall, wonderful store for all ages of Lego lovers. Boys and girls, teens and adults. Prices are from low end to WTF it's a piece of plastic!! ;)"""""""
5	Fletcher's Tire and Auto is really great. Both my husband and I have used this place and had a great experience each time. I went in with a nail in my tire with my two little kids in tow. They had me in and out in 30 minutes at a very fair price. I was treated well, everything was explained and a price quoted upfront and they had me out the door super quick. You can't ask for more than that. I highly recommend this place.
5	OMG!  I totally agree with Jetta R.  A similiar scenario happens to me everytime I ask someone that has never heard about Chino Bandido.   When you do ask someone who has been to the place they get so excited and start asking have you tried the Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Fried Rice, etc etc... and how did they ever think that you could mix all those things together?  It's a crazy concoction that works and can not be described but must be experienced.
5	My wife and I were on our honeymoon, and were just looking for a nice place to stay before we flew back to the midwest.  We stayed here and could not have been happier.  Spotless room, tasteful decor, great shower, free wine during happy hour.  We wanted to make an evening out of our last night on honeymoon, and actually never even wound up leaving the hotel premises.  Had an AWESOME dinner on the 2nd floor restaurant, and poolside drinks both before and after dinner (not to mention a nice dip in the pool).  I'd definitely go back and recommend this place to anyone headed to Phoenix.
4	I get to visit Chandler, AZ for work and I must say, that the more I frequent this area, the more I find places where I can be a tourist and try the local delicacies. The first few times I visited, people weren't Yelping much around this area so it was always a hit or miss when dining. Now, it seems more are Yelping in Chandler which helps a tourist like me find those local places that local peeps love. Locals must love that!\n\nThanks to Yelp(ers), I found a decent Cuban restaurant near the hotel I usually stay at when I'm in Chandler. Mimita's is in a strip mall near the bowling alley. It's not as small as people have mentioned, it's a pretty decent-sized place. I hear they sometimes have a band/music so maybe it can get cramped during those times.\n\nAnyways, on to the food. For starters you get 4 grilled slices of bread with butter. It was very good and a nice surprise before the meal. I had 4 slices all to myself and couldn't get enough of them. For my main dish, I couldn't decide between one of the common Cuban sandwiches or a specialty plate. I decided to try a specialty plate #31 the Ropa Vieja, a dish with shredded beef w/bell peppers in a savory sauce. The waitress gave me options with the rice and the side dish and I opted with the rice mixed with the beans and sweet plantains as my side--this ended up being great choices. The rice with beans and the essence of garlic was a great combination--I really liked this rice version a lot. You can also never go wrong with sweet fried plantains. Someone mentioned in their review that the Ropa Vieja seem bland, but I think this had a lot to do with all the flavors coming together with the rice and the sweet plantains. All were delicious as a combination and it worked.\n\nWhat a great find! Mimita's will definitely be a stop whenever I'm in town. In fact, I should schedule myself out there soon! Maybe for the Cactus League Spring training...errr...I mean meeting with my people in Chandler? Yeah, that's it!
4	Ok, for starters, it's better than the Vig because it doesn't smell like the dumpster out back.  Sorry, Original Vig, but the incense just doesn't cut it and I know it's not your fault, but it is what it is....\n\nUptown Vig is appropriately Sheesh, a bit larger footprint, and the original construction elements of the bank building are tastefully complimented with modern design twist.  \n\nGreyhounds are the drink to beat.  Food is OK, mostly go there for the atmosphere and the booze....\n\nI'm in.
4	I am an out-of-towner (from San Francisco), but have been going to RA on Scottsdale Rd since before they expanded their dining room and continue to be impressed with their service, quality of food, and their atmosphere. My first time in AZ, I was skeptical about sushi in the desert. Those reservations have long since been quelled. Their food has consistently been fresh, creatively prepared and delicious. My favorite: their Lobster-Shrimp roll on a pesto sauce. And they NEVER have run out of TORO when I wanted it-- I would add a 1/2 star for that, if I could. The service has always been efficient and professional with groups ranging from 2 to 10. The atmosphere is consistently upbeat, fun, playing the latest in pop/top 40 music, but never so loud you can't have a conversation. A great spot to start the night before heading out in Old Town.
3	So, Pei Wei is still what it is.... fast food. That being said, I liked this location a lot better than the Guadalupe location. The BF got a gift card for PF chang's, so we decided to get pei wei tonight, as it is cheaper and PF chang's is not so great.... Anyway, I ordered the Chili Ramen and it was one of the better things I have gotten at pei wei. I ordered it extra spicy and it was spicy.... not crazy hot, but it had a little kick. The BF and I shared the potstickers and they were fried to crap.... not my fave. Overall, it was fine, not great, but not bad, which is a plus for this chain.

5	This place is amazing.  The pizza is very comparable to pizza in Naples, where pizza was originally born!  Simple toppings but still very flavorful.  The crust of the pizza was a perfect flavor.  I got the Margarita pizza and it was a little soggy in the middle but I think they might use canned tomatoes, but the tomatoes were still really good!  Fresh doesn't always mean better and tastier.  We got calamari and it was lightly battered which was different and very good.  The squid was very tender too.  There were also thick shreds of parmesan cheese on top.  I love parm cheese!  The lasagna had loads of meat, mostly sausage too.  It was lightly cheesed which I didn't think I would like because I love cheese.  It was still very good!  The linguine frutti di mare had tons of seafood as well.  The red sauce for it wasn't that flavorful though.  I wished I asked before we ordered because the pasta dish that was on DDD was the spaghetti pie, which was the special for the Friday I was there!  Darn it!  It looked so good when Guy Fieri was eating it.
2	We arrived close to closing (an early 9pm) and got a perfunctory 'you'd better order right now' from the hostess.  A scowling white guy was checking something on a monitor as we walked past the entrance, and as we are seated I notice a row of dirty glasses left on a window ledge at our table.  I get a very un-Thai like calimari salad that is only mildy interesting, while my gf has something I ate a lot of, but cannot remember.  For a restaurant with a higher price tag than other local Thai places, and a very nice address smack in the middle of Old Scottsdale, I would have expected more.
3	I've wanted to try this buffet for a long time, since it's close to where I live and I pass by it all the time. Got my chance today, and was it worth the visit? Well, I did enjoy my meal but It wasn't something to write home about, either. I would say it's a moderately good Chinese buffet, not great. Some of  the dishes were just OK, some were good, a few were great. Recommended dishes: their fried chicken (just lightly flour-dredged, not thickly battered, and very tasty), the Singapore rice noodles, and the shrimp dishes. Other dishes, including dessert, were about typical for a  large Chinese buffet restaurant.  The restaurant is very spacious and the servers were very friendly. My meal here was not spectacular, but pleasant and satisfying enough.
3	Pho is one my favorite lunchtime eats.  I used to work on the west side of Phoenix where there are more choices of Vietnamese restaurants.  Pho DaLat was my first venture on the east side.  It's a great location off of Kyrene and Elliot Road and is upscale compared to your typical mom and pop shops over on the west side.  Good staff and fast service.  My problem was that food was not that great.  Not bad either, but not as flavorful as I've had elsewhere.  The Pho broth was a little weak even though there was plenty of meat in the bowl.  The veggies were limited to a small handful of sprouts and some fresh basil.  I would have love to have some mint and cilantro as well other leafy greens to throw into the steaming broth.  Just a bit skimpy for my tastes.  The spring roll were decent, but again missing something..  The menu itself seemed to skimp on other Vietnamese fairs.\n\nAnyhow, not the worst, but not the best.  I'll continue to search out for a better bowl of Pho on the East Side..  My adventure continues...
3	I love booze at places where there shouldn't be booze. Drinking beer at Peter Piper Pizza. Having a Bloody Mary at breakfast. Brown-bagging it at the public library (kidding?).\n\nNaturally, I should love the newly remodeled AMC Esplanade 14--and I sort of do. I've been coming here since a kid, and the old girl was starting to show her age. Thank goodness iPic rolled in to town to show everyone how it's done, and my beloved theater followed suit. The two things I love most are being able to reserve seats ahead of time (I HATE having to show up half an hour before a movie starts to get decent seats), and of course, the booze.\n\nWhy only three stars? The service and the filth. The service is iffy--we've had good and we've had God-awful. This is no iPic, which is a well-oiled machine. These are the same kids who used to just take your tickets, forced into a serving job they really don't know how to do. And then there's the filth. People were in our seats (bastards!) when we arrived, so after the staff asked them to move, we sat down. The table by my seat was all sticky, and we finally had to ask someone to wipe it down. No one came over (apparently our seat-stealers received the only visit planned for our spot), so I went to press the service button. It was covered in ketchup, so I used the sticky menu to press the button. They eventually brought our order, leaving the same roll of silverware that had been sitting there with our seat-stealers. Gross? The silverware went untouched until a server rushed by, grabbed it, and handed it to the people sitting behind us. He didn't even ask if we were going to use it (we weren't), and he never brought us another roll.\n\nGross.
2	"""Its seems like a decent place, and certainly has potential, but we wont be back until its more sanitary.  My problem being VEGAN is that the meat station is at the beginning of the line.  This wouldn't be a problem if PEOPLE DIDN'T USE THE VEGETABLE TONGS TO SQUISH DOWN THEIR RAW MEAT into the tiny bowls provided.  I asked the line staff how they prevent cross contamination to which she replied \I dont understand what that means.\""""  Ok, fair enough, she isnt educated.  So I asked for a separate clean tong to use, even though I know that \""""meat juices\"""" are already mixed in with the veggies.  She said they only have one for each container, and no extra clean ones.  At this point I was just too grossed out to eat.  My husband, being a carnivore didnt mind, but has been in the bathroom \""""declaring war on Mongolia\"""" all evening, so I guess my theory could have been correct.  \nWe brought all this up to our waitress, as I would have like to have had dinner there, and she says its the corporate office's decision to have it that way, and had been asked this same question several times before. She mentioned that Muslims should absolutely NOT eat there, as there was NO way of knowing for sure if the food was cross contaminated with pork, and that the sign asking about \""""allergies, and special dietary requests\"""" was a joke. \nUntil they switch up the order of the stations, Veggies Beware!"""""""
4	The menu is probably the best thing about this place. There are so many choices from which to decide! We're not steak and potatoes types, so having such a variety of seafood, vegetarian, and chicken dishes is awesome. Mostly Asian inspired, the menu also features a variety of burgers, sandwiches, salads, steaks, and at least one lamb dish. I really enjoyed my Salmon Roll and Macau Shrimp and Noodle Soup Combo ($9.95) which had 6 delicious sushi-type rolls and 8 oz bowl of soup chunky enough to nosh with chopsticks. It came with gari & a healthy pat of hot wasabi. My husband loved his Szechwan Shrimp & Chicken in Spiced Garlic Sauce  ($11.95). Our business acquaintence ordered Orange Chicken  ($12.25) that he likes so much he orders it every time.\n\nService was great. There was a small variety of beers on tap. Chopsticks right on the table. My only beef was that the pre-wrapped silverwear had chunks of food still stuck to it, and the napkin is too flimsy to serve as a lap napkin or to wipe the soup off your face.\n\nAll in all, the great variety on the menu, good service, tasty food, unique atmosphere,  and moderate prices make this a solid choice for lunch or dinner.
4	This is the type of restaurant/coffee bar you take somebody whom you want to impress. Liberty Market is modern, stylish, and has excellent food and service to back up the impressive atmosphere. I have in the past driven 30 minutes from my house just to have an iced carmel latte made by these guys. It's just that good. The menu is also inventive and I would highly recommend getting the appetizer pizza to start with hummus on the side. All of the meals are great, and therefore I can't recommend anything above the rest. It's all so good! Be sure to check out the restrooms before you leave, too. Go inside every stall (they are co ed) and be amazed! Four solid stars from this girl!
3	Really like this urban chic chinese restaurant!  The open architecture really makes this place fun to sit and enjoy a meal!  The owners got it right!  \n\nAs for the food, I am a little bit jaded when it comes to Chinese food being from NY and SF but, the dishes I have tried so far are good.  They need to tweak a few recipes to stand out from the crowd, but what they offer now is very good.  All the standards are present on the menu.  A few house specialties are highlighted too....
1	Sure the lobby is fancy smancy but the pool is a hole in the ground filled with water and the rooms must have been left out of the recent renovation. \n\nThey have a 4PM check in time and a noon check out time. 4PM seems a little too late, and seriously 4 hours to clean a room?\n\nI also have not seen a TV that small in a hotel room let alone in any room since my grandma's kitchen. \n\nThe price was ridiculously high for the room/TV/bathroom/ and pathetic pool.  Service was alright. $261 a night. \n\nThe restaurant was beyond awful. Service was a joke and food was terrible. \n\nI would never stay at this hotel again.
3	I am a big victoria's secret fan. I've been to countless stores all over the country...this one is not my favorite. The service is fine, but since they are currently in a pop-up location by Barney's, the selection is extremely limited. I'm hoping that when the regular location by the food court re-opens I will be pleasently surprised. I'd love to see a larger VSX Sport collection available. I love their yoga pants, but they are becoming harder and harder to find!
5	GolfWeek, Golf Magazine and Golf Digest all have this golf course in their Top Five in the state of Arizona.  I have yet to play either Troon North tracks and have only played We-Ko-Pa's Cholla course but Southern Dunes might well be the best.  \n\nAs others have noted, it's (1) a bit of a hike to get to the course, being some 45 miles south from the heart of the Phoenix and (2) its scenery and layout is unlike other desert layouts.  The absence of cacti and the predominance of planted tropical trees makes this course feel more mid-Atlantic and on some holes, Florida-like.  And of course, with Fred Couples involved, the course lays the beach on heavy with over 119 bunkers.    \n\nThe course was manicured to near perfect conditions on the day I played (12/9).  The tee boxes were cut, the fairways were impeccable and the greens rolled fast and true with very little ball marks marring the surface.  It's apparent the Troon-managed maintenance crew puts a premium on having the course look near-perfect at all times.  The course itself is wide-open although if you tend to slice or hook the ball on a consistent basis you may wish you'd stayed home.  The bunkers are strategically placed gobble up shots from every tee box and approach.  One additional note:  The sand in the bunkers is of the dirtish variety and, as such, steep and deep sand shots are almost worthless in these traps. \n\nThe staff is polite and helpful and the starter will answer any of your questions. The clubhouse is nice and bathrooms make you feel like you're in the Ritz (clean wash towels are provided as is mouthwash and other toiletries).   I'm a local now but if I were planning a golf vacation out here, I'd put Southern Dunes in my rotation right now.  Highly recommended.
5	Excellent food, fast service, excellent customer service, great prices. Exactly what a mom and pop store should be. \n\nI had the 1/2lb (double) with standard toppings, cooked medium. It was superb! They use a thinner sized patty then what I prefer but make up for it in taste, quality, and size. I would have been slightly disappointed if I had ordered the 1/4lb one. They char grill on a huge 560,000 BTU cooking machine. Fast, hot and tasty. \n\nGreat Job my friends, keep it up.
3	I really wanted to like this place. I found the calamari to be chewy and undercooked. Minestrone was bland. Chicken Marsala was lacking flavor as well. My boyfriend had the pasta & fagioli which was very tasty and pasta carbonera, which was also very tasty. The server was attentive and kept glasses and breadbaskets full. The hostess needs to go. We were seated facing her and she spent the entire time twirling her hair and picking at her split ends looking bored to death. Would I go back? Probably not, there are plenty of other restaurants to try.
2	"""This is a nice place to visit at least once a month. The place appears clean and the owners do a good job at meet-and-greet. The quality of staff has been hit-and-miss but mostly accommodating as needed. The food is your average \kitchen food,\"""" nothing to brag about.\n\nAs noted in a previous review, the staff, along with the owners, need to stop eating food where the customers can see them. To top it off, I saw some of them licking their fingers after shoving their food down their pipes. They need to be more cognizant customers do judge the place by how the employees conduct themselves."""""""
2	Food was mediocre.  Margs were decent.  Service was so-so.  Nothing really all that special to Yelp about.  Just another mediocre food experience.  Being surrounded by good friends made the night.  We sat on patio and sweated our asses off.  The misters didn't help but the margs did.  I wanted water but they never re-filled it so I came home really thirsty.  The food looked better than it tasted. I had the tacos and I wanted the shells to be better than the store bought ones but that is all they had.  My husband had the fish tacos-- it was more like a civeche in a soggy corn tortilla.  \n\nJust, you know, not the best you can get that is for sure.
5	Far and away the restaurant I have frequented most often, 5th Avenue is superlative for service and food quality for the price. Other reviews describe it as a greasy spoon or good hangover food. Perhaps - but then if these folks were looking for cordon bleu, they were in the wrong place, weren't they. It's a breakfast/lucnh place, so compare it to Denny's or IHOP - with exponentially improved quality.\n\nIt's as healthy as you make it - you can order french toast, eggs, and bacon or an egg white omlette! They are awesome at accepting alterations on menu items. The only thing I ever ordered that I didn't like wa the Fiesta Omlette - chili beans over eggs. Not because it wasn't tasty - but it was just a weird combination that didn't work for me.\n\nThis morning, boyfriend and I went for breakfast. The cafe was busier than we've ever seen it - and, according to the owner, busier than he's ever seen it either! Absolutely love seeing local businesses thrive.\n\nIf you're ever in Central Phoenix near 7th Avenue and Thomas and need a bite for breakfast or lunch, 5th Avenue Cafe may really surprise you with their homey atmosphere, friendly service, good food, and low prices.
5	What can I say about Execucar. I love their service. It cost just as much if not cheaper than taking a cab for me. I make a reservation on-line, get confirmation via email as well as a phone call the day before confirming my reservation. The cars are always nice, clean, and fresh smelling (yes that may seem weird but I have been in some cabs that were like WHOA!) The drivers are always in shirts, ties, and slacks and they are professional and courteous. I have never had a driver be late (knock on wood) and they have always gotten me to the airport on-time. Plus I get some frequent flyer miles added to my USAirways account for using them. Can we say bonus!
4	"""What I Ate\n- 80 percent of the menu\n\nMy Favorites\n- warm duck salad\n- Washyugyu short rib\n- soft shell crab salad\n\nWould I Go Again?\nLet me begin by clarifying that Nobuo scores a \5\"""" in quality, presentation, and creativity.  If I were a judge on Chopped, I would have \""""chopped\"""" the other three chefs after the appetizer round.  The restaurant had a great atmosphere, and each tapas-style dish was very good.  So why did I rate Phoenix's #1-rated, Beard-award-winning restaurant only a 4?!  Simply because sushi isn't really my thing."""""""
5	I'm so happy this location exists! I am a die-hard fan of Cartel's black market espresso for my home machine, and it's easy to get my fix here since we find ourselves in old town on a regular basis.\n\nWe buy 3 bags at a time since they comp our drinks with the purchase. I always get a toddy to go, and I love the simple syrup pump they have out because I can quickly sweeten my drink.  \n\nThe staff is pretty nice and polite, no attitudes detected here. One server even took the time to explain different techniques to make iced coffee when I asked about some of their equipment.\n\nThe coffee itself is my absolute favorite. It's smooth while still providing a good caffeine kick. It has comletely ruined us. It's not cheap, but I justify the splurge since my morning cappuccinos are what gets me out of bed in the morning.
3	I enjoy Fair Trade because it gives me an opportunity to stop for a drink while I'm riding the light rail from North Phoenix to Mesa.\n\nThe coffee is alright, not bad, but nothing that I crave. The tea is along the same lines. The food is rather costly and I would rather run up the street to Carly's to grab a sandwich. \n\nI do enjoy the service, which is always quick and knowledgeable. My drink is always made the way I want, which is the most important consideration. Fair Trade also has a frequent buyer program in which they keep your buyer's card on hand for you. I appreciate that. They provide enough table and outlet space for a plethora of computer users. Plus, as a teacher, I appreciate any place that provides discounts for teachers, police, firefighters, etc.\n\nOverall, I am good with Fair Trade. I will always stop when I'm riding past, but I don't like it enough to go out of my way.
4	So where to begin. It's a small place that's your typical hole in the wall setting, but clean. Pictures hung on the walls provides some ideas of what the dishes look like. Those of you that are used to Panda Express, PF Chang, or your typical American Chinese food or whatever New York Chinese food are, you won't find anything familiar. This is a place that specializes in northern Chinese food. This means noodles, dumplings, buns, and lots of wheat based products. The place should get an extra star for not having beef and broccoli on their menu. I mean seriously there is no broccoli in China until the recent decade. Beef and broccoli IS NOT Chinese food! The menu certainly brings back childhood memories. This is authentic northern China home cooking people! I do see some Sichuan dishes and I'm curious to try. \n\nWent with couple co-workers for lunch to check the place out. I ordered the dumplings and the meat pie. The woman that owns the place was extremely nice. The service was above average. She brought out the corn based congee, which I'm assuming comes free with the meal. It's pretty much flavorless but easily fixed by putting in some soy sauce. I'm assuming that's how they are served authentically. The dumplings are ok and could used some additional seasoning. But they aren't super doughy like other Chinese places. I liked the meat pie. It was hot, juicy, and yummy. I can certainly say it was filling and I was stuffed. I'm definitely going back and try out some of the stirfry dishes. Haven't had those for eons and I really hope they live up to expectation. When it comes down to it, it's home cooking. You aren't going to find it superbly amazing like a 4 star restaurant and this is no Imperial cooking, but they are hearty and filling at a decent price. Until I try their other dishes, they'll get 4 stars because the memories made me happy, the service was good, and the food wasn't half bad. :) I really hope they would maybe offer the pork and veggie bao. That would just put it over the top.
3	I have  been here a few times and have had a fairly good experience with this location.  It's located close to the Fiesta Mall, and is easy to spot from the road.  I prefer this location to the Tempe Marketplace one because its substantially easier to get in and out of the mall area..Tempe Marketplace is quite the bottleneck, and this place is easy!\n\nI've come here for a few small things before, but finally purchased a digital camera from here yesterday.  I would say most of the time I have been approached for help from the staff here.  Sometimes I don't get approached, but it's really random, and if it's busy they may all be tied up.  Other times I feel like I'm being stalked, and try to shoo them away, and they won't leave me alone!!!\n\nAnyways, I will return to shop here as I've always enjoyed Best Buy!
4	Well I have been here many times in the past so I know what to expect even before walking through the door. There is the Welcome to Red Robin greeting, followed by the question as to how many are in your party? That is where the similarities end with this half burger chain and half sports bar and most chain restaurants. \n\nYes there are other chain restaurants with locations scattered in and around the valley that all promise the same hand crafted burger masterpiece, but how many of them offer that delicious burger combined with bottomless fries? They may all offer similar products but ask anyone with any experience with chain style eateries and they will tell you there are always those small yet noticeable differences. \n\nThis location is near to the mall which means it is usally populated by middle aged couples, 30 somethings who like a few cocktails with their meal ( watch out for them on the road) , and teens who want to hang with friends and share some really tasty burgers. Their claim to fame is their large selection of burgers, chicken sandwiches, salads, and drinks. I normally order the mushroom swiss, or a bacon blue cheese burger. \n\nWith each juicy bite I can feel my stomach growing and my waist line expanding LOL. Seriously if you want those little dried out frozen patties found at your local drive through then this is not the place for you. Honestly as with BBQ it is important to understand that if you are going to do something make sure you do it right!!! Don't take shortcuts, make sure you use the best ingredients you can afford, and most of all do not call something that it is not!! \n\nIt is like saying you want a Philly Cheese steak sandwich and then cooking a package of steakums and placing it on two slices of white bread.  Seriously with about 13 of  what they call their signature burgers, 7 kinds of bread, 7 kinds of cheese, and a toppings list that would make old Mcdonald which they came from his farm this is the place to indulge all your grilled beef fantasies. Just make sure you learn from my experience and wear your large eating pants. Trust me you will need them.\n\nCase closed
3	I would recommend going to this place just to checkout the inside...It was definitely not what I expected (bare dark/black room like many 'industrial rock-goth clubs'). It has a raised cathedral style ceiling with gargoyles giving it a dark Gothic church feeling inside.  There is an evil tinge with statues and artwork of Lucifer and red chandeliers... The DJ booth overlooks the whole bar from, what reminds me of, a castle spire. \nThe sound system is amazing, clear and crisp, possibly the best one in Phoenix. I went on a Wednesday so it was pumping the sounds of industial rock and some post punk and indie rock. Sanctum also has laser lights and an interesting male/female bathroom... \n\nThe crowd is eccentric for sure, but one would be silly to expect anything else considering the description above. Feel free to dance till you can't anymore, even if just with yourself. In case you didn't get the memo, most people in here wear very dark colors...not sure I would show up in a springy sundress. But all walks of life are welcome in this unpretentious and carefree club.
5	Yup, another 5 stars.   I was almost feeling guilty about giving a place five stars after only one visit, but I really do believe they deserve it!  This time, there was a group of 6 of us.  We walked in, were told it'd be about 15/20 minute wait, which is to be expected without a reservation and a group of six.  In the mean time, the host told us we were welcome to visit the bar, but then after a minute or so she asked us if she could get us something from there.  I could  not for the life of me remember what sake we had the last time, so I threw a couple of descriptions her way and BAM, suddenly I was sipping on the exact same one again.  Also, she suggested a non filtered sake, which she warned us would be cloudy.  We decided to wait until we got to the table for that one.  I was hoping they had the red snapper special that night, but unfortunately it was not on the list.  BUT this mackrel dish was, and it was deeLISH!  I mean this place just has presentation and delivery down!  They brought the sashimi mackrel out, and then took a blow torch to the top of it right there in front of us, yum yum!  After ordering our meal we asked for the non filtered sake, and the waitress said it was definitely a good pairing for our food selection, it would nutralize the heat with the suttle sweetness, man was she right, it was like horchata. One couple with us, got some stir-fry tofu veggie dish.  It came out sizzling in a pan still cooking.  I got to taste it, and I wanted to steal the whole thing.  The won tons and dumplings are a must for the BF and I and we were not disappointed.  I just love this place, it's definitely not somewhere I can go a whole bunch of times, but right now my record is once a month!
1	"""My current roommate and I recently moved into these apartments after being recommended from one of our close friends who had also recently moved in. Since none of us have ever lived here before, we did not know that the website was filled with lies and illusions. Though on the outside the complex appears cheery, the people in the office are less then subpar. hey have the customer service skills of a rock. Upon moving in, my roommate and I began to experience loud noises and fighting coming from our neighbors on the 3rd floor. The fight literally lasted from 1:00AM -5:00AM. I woke up for work (tired from the lack of sleep) and they were STILL fighting. It sounded like a girl and a guy were really having some relationship issues. I let it go and continued on to work. \n\nThe next night  the fighting continued. Now it sounded like it was getting violent with shouts like \YOU HIT ME FIRST,\"""" and \""""I WILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.\"""" I could not take it anymore and decided to call the police. At 2:45AM on a Wednesday I called the police to file a noise complaint. The operator was extremely nice for the early hour and sent 2 officers out. After about 20-30 minutes I hear loud knocking on the door above me. Finally the yelling stopped and I was able to get some sleep (Thanks to Phoenix's Finest). The next night the fighting continued and so did the loud bangs and booms. When I say loud noises, I am talking about \""""booms\"""" so loud that our windows shook in the bedrooms. It sounded like bowling balls were being thrown around...or bodies. My roommate came into my room to see if I was awake and to no surprise I was already staring at the ceiling seeing red. We decided to call the police again at around the usual 2:45AM time. This time we requested for the cop to come down to our place and report what they discussed with the inconsiderate neighbors. After dozing in and out trying to stay awake about an hour and a half later we decided that we couldnt wait for the police any longer and fell asleep. I was jolted awake when i heard a loud knock on our front door. I hopped out of bed and walked towards the front, my roommate quickly stopped me and said that was not the cop. She said that the knock did not sound like a cop's knock. Before I could look through the peep hole we then heard through the door \""""OPEN UP, WE KNOW YOU CALLED THE COPS.\"""" it was our lovely neighbors paying us a visit. Again they continued on saying \""""IF YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO CALL THE COPS YOU SHOULD HAVE THE BALLS TO OPEN THE DOOR.\"""" The knocking continued for another 7-10 minutes and progressively became louder and louder. We then heard one of the guys run  up and down the stairs screaming and banging on other tenants doors in a fit of rage that the police were called on them. My roommate and I never went back to sleep and drove around from 6:00AM-9:00AM to wait for the office to open. When the office opened we went in to let them know about the insane madness that went on during the night. Let's not forget I had to call out of work and miss out on an opportunity to make money. The office could care less and did absolutely nothing. With the exception of one employee, CJ, the office employees have no sense of how to treat a person. The manager, Lisa,  was the worst of all. She spoke over me, made me seem like i was blowing things out of proportion and when I stated how upset it made me feel she followed by stating \""""we have all gone through difficult things in our life.\"""" \n\nCurrently as it stands my roommate and I have been here for about 4 months and are still dealing with the horrible neighbors. I have been called a \""""bitch\"""" by one of them while walking to my car, the noise will not stop and is still causing us sleepless nights, our complaints are left unheard and unnoticed, it is flat out miserable. The 2 of the neighbors have moved out but now the one left has his friends staying with him and they make more noise then ever. Our place is absolutely miserable. Our door is constantly being knocked on and just tonight the neighbors jiggled the handle while we were sitting in the living room watching TV. We have become a joke to them because they know the office will not do anything. they could care less about the people who live here and I have never lived in a place that was so disrespectful to their tenants. We have gone to everyone working in there and they all act like their hands are tied. It's pathetic. The last person I spoke with today stated that if we wait a week \""""things should work out themselves.\"""" when i asked for the number to the customer relations to file a complaint, she basically told me that it would not do any good and refused to give it to me. \n\nWhatever you do DO NOT LIVE HERE!!! It is not worth it. They make you sign a 15 month lease and trap you in with unpleasant people both in the office and living around you. This is also in a crap neighborhood. You dont feel safe, regardless of the \""""dummy\"""" cop car parked in front, it's not fooling anyone."""""""
4	So another first date, another restaurant that I didn't get to chose.  I'll admit, I wasn't terribly excited about going to Sapporo, seeing as it was in North Scottsdale and I had spent my day drinking with a friend at Rose and Crown.  I'm taking date pregaming to a whole new level!\n\nSo I roll into Sapporo around 9:15, 45 minutes late for my date.  Again, I don't do North Scottsdale and have no desire to visit the land of the cougars and sugar daddies.  But I figured on a Thursday night at 9 that the bar would be laid back.  Boy was I wrong.  I forgot that cougars are living off of their exes and current sugar daddies and they have kids they couldn't give two sh*ts about.  So they were out in full force, and getting very hammered and trying to dance to Lady Gaga songs.  All the money in the world couldn't buy these hags class.\n\nBut I'm here to get some free drinks and possibly some high quality sushi.  The waitress was extremely attentive and was nice enough to remind us that the kitchen does eventually close, so we should probably order.  I can't remember the exact name of the roll I order, but I went with my usual roll requirements of spicy tuna, avocado, and scallops.  I have to admit that the sushi was fresh, so no complaints here.  And seeing as I didn't have to pay, and was pretty buzzed throughout my whole date I can give this place 4 stars.  Now if I was sober and actually paid attention to the atmosphere and prices, I know this place would drop in stars.\n\nMuch love to the server Brittany!  You are absolutely adorable and a total sweetheart!
5	Dr. DeMark is the best dentist on the planet. He is so friendly, warm, and funny. Always making jokes, telling you exactly what he is going to do, and checking in during procedures to make sure you are okay. He calls you the night of your procedure just to make sure everything is okay instead of having you sit in pain miserable overnight on the rare case something goes awry. \n\nMost people hate their dentists, but, I love mine! If he wasn't married with 8 kids, I'm sure he would love me too!\n\nAnyway, onto business. The whole entire office at Today's Dental is super friendly and accommodating. I love going there (seriously) because everyone is so nice and friendly, they make sure all of your questions are answered, and they spend whatever time they need with you versus making you feel like a number. \n\nThe office is really nice, clean, and they have two TV's with about 100 channels in every room. One for when you are sitting up, and one on the ceiling when you are laying down! Baller!\n\nThe hours are great and they normally always have lunch appointments available. \n\n100% recommend this office. I have referred 4 people there already who are equally as happy with Dr. DeMark and Today's Dental!
4	A friend and I split a beef shawarma, a chicken shawarma, and a couple of different types of baklavas. And a meat pie.  So we had a total of 7 items and it cost $16. Nice! My favorite was the chicken shawarma, marinated chicken and some veggies with a garlic spread wrapped in a pita which is baked on-premises. The baklava-type desserts consisted of flaky pastry with a custard-type of filling. Forgive me for not knowing the exact names of the ingredients as I know very little about the ins and outs of Middle Eastern food other than putting it IN my mouth! Some of the crusts could be a little oily around the edges. Only enough of a deterrent to remind me not to eat these every day! \n\nService is fast and friendly; I will definetly return!
5	To be honest, I have lost my enjoyment of going to the movies.  Far too often the titles to choose from are uninteresting, the theaters are too crowded, full of rude patrons, and or dirty.  To top it all off, you get to pay almost in upwards of $10 to experience all of this!\n\nHarkins Camelview is one of those gems in the rough!!!  The movies they play are some of the best indie titles running, the theaters aren't the size of a sports arena, the seats are almost comfortable enough to fall asleep in, everything is well kept and I've never had an instance where the patrons ruined my movie watching experience!  As stated before too the popcorn is perhaps the best you'll find!  I am also a big fan of the great location, and retro design of the movie house!\n\nThe next time you want to get out of the house and take in a movie, be sure to give Harkins Camelview 5 a try!
4	We were having lunch provided for us at work on Christmas Eve.  I was put in charge of ordering and picking up food, and my boss instructed me to get pizza from Grimaldi's.  I called and placed the order on the Friday before, and called to confirm the order on that Monday morning.  When i showed up 10 min past the time I told them I wanted to pick up the pizza, I was sure it would be there, however, it was not.  They did not have my order and I was left with 80 hungry people. \n\nThat's as bad as the story gets, though.  The manager came over and said they were getting started on my order and that it would be 10-15 more minutes.  Although it ended up being 45 min, we had all the pizzas we wanted.  To top it off, the manager took care of the order for me to make up for being late.\n\nThe pizza was of course delicious, and I want to thank Grimaldi's for doing the right thing to keep a customer happy!  I would definitely feel comfortable giving them my business again for another work event.  Mistakes happen, and as long as they do the right thing they're ok in my book.  Thanks Grimaldi's!
5	Eyebrow wax?  No way.  It's all about the thread.  \n\nTori is absolutely amazing.  She is so accommodating too.  My friend and I called an hour before we showed, and she said to just come on in, and that she'll fit us in her schedule.  We were literally in there for maybe 10 minutes, and then we were out-thee quickest brow service ever!  \n\nShe knows what she's doing.  All she asks of you is to sort of pull your upper eyebrow skin...which is fair to me if I don't have to deal with any sort of sticky residue afterward, no blotching, no redness-all the irritants you get from waxing, gone!  \n\nThreading is just soo good.  It leaves you with the most natural, precise lines.  Thank you Tori!!
4	"""While I didn't get the authentic Vincent Southwestern French experience (they offer a limited menu in summer...the waiter explained that their regular menu is too wintery and heavy for the summer season), I am still glad I finally made it to this Valley fine dining establishment. We opted for their special \Julia & Julia\"""" $35 3-course prix fixe menu, a great value at a restaurant where entrees alone typically run $35. All but one of the dishes were Julia Child recipes, while the one that wasn't was a dish Chef Vincent cooked for Julia Child many years ago. The dishes were very classic French fare, and all were exceptional. And their croissants...oh my! I could've eaten 10 of them! The service at Vincent's is professional and friendly, if not always the most prompt, while the dining room is Old World elegant (think French Cottage dishes and a player piano). If you've never tried Vincent's or haven't been in a while, I highly recommend taking advantage of this great deal while you can (this August only!)."""""""
5	Love this place. Love it. \n\nAs with most places in the Raintree/FLW area, during lunchtime it gets superduper busy. They have a good layout, and a TON of seating, so this location doesn't get too bad. They always have a friendly greeter handing out cookie bits while you wait in line, and the line moves quick. The menu is well laid out (better than other Paradise locations) and the food is top notch.\n\nTheir side (overflow) room is great for seating a group of people, and they have a tv in there too (unusual for Paradise). Couldn't be better. Plus they have free wifi. Bring the laptop and stay a while.\n\nOnly complaint is that its a tiny bit pricy, but considering what you get, its worth it. Half salad, half sandwich, drink and a cookie (best part) is around $10.
2	Ok, here we go again.  You wash your hands, but they only have those stupid air blowers that take forever to try & dry them, so you go for ass gaskets instead.  There is a dispenser but it's empty, so you spend a while back at the air blower.  Then you go (with your still damp hands) for toilet paper to open the door with, because it has a latch & you'd like to leave the bathroom with you hands cleaner than when you entered!  So far we're at 1 Star     :-O\n\nThe service & food were ok, but I won't return to this McDonalds.\n\nMcRib Combo $4.89, Ice Cream Cone $.79
4	Let's start with the chips and salsa. They give you normal crispy chips AND decadently fluffy tortilla chips with a really fresh salsa. Super duper tasty!\n\nNow, I can't remember what I had the first few times I came here but I know I was blown away. However, the only thing that matters anymore are the spinach enchalads. They are served with a incredibly flavorful red sauce and then topped with another white sauce and get this - TOASTED ALMOND SLICES. Yes, toasted almond slices. These lil' babies add the most insane texture to the creaminess of the cheese and spinach filling. I would love to have a plate of these right now - at 8:03am. The rice and beans are also excellent.\n\nI can't speak to the alcohol selection too well but I did have a non-alcoholic prickly pear margarita and it was rather scrumptious. I was assured the one with alcohol was just as tasty and you get a ridiculous sucker in the shape of a cactus.\n\nMy only complaint is the service can be hit or miss. Last time I went was father's day around 1 or 2 and the place wasn't very busy. Our server was a bit of an airhead (and rather squeaky but that's not their fault).
5	hThis is an extremely biased review. After all, I've been coming to Tricks for  more than a decade and I've gotten to the point in my life that I gauge the people I may want to spend time with on a little litmus test of my own invention.  I will not divulge what the other items on my test are, just in case you're reading this and want to be my friend.  Or enemy.  Frankly, I don't give a shit.  But if you don't like Tricks, you're out.  The wine tastings, especially the annual Wine Fiesta, are legendary in Phoenix, the bar has more ambience than Tempeans know what to do with and the menu, especially now with the newly cooked up HOT 46 happy hour items, are a gourmand's wet dream.  You can't go wrong with food at Tricks.  \n\nUp until recently, if one was hungry on a Friday night, say around 1030, your choices were limited to Casey Moore's (another fabulous drinkery and eatery but of a different ilk than Tricks), a couple of gas inducing Mexican treats at Taco Bell or any of the other something-Berto's dotted around the valley or delivery from pizza pie people.  A few weeks ago, after lamenting this lack of eats at this time on the weekends, I nursed on my third or fifth Guinness while sitting under the trees (growing up through the bar, right overhead) of this sublime bar.  The bartender, Gavin, a bloke who during the day can also suit you up in the finest garments for any occasion from a bris to a board meeting, slid the HOT 46 menu in front of me.  Served Monday thru Saturday from 4 to 6 PM and on Friday and Saturday from 10 to midnite, this delectable and slight menu will sate the hunger roiling inside your belly.  I tried all six items and found nary a clunker in the bunch. \n\nHomemade Artisan Grilled Cheese with Roasted Garlic Tomato Basil Soup - much better than your drunken special made at 240 AM, post-bar with neon-yellow American cheese and penicillin-hosting white bread.  It's fine, people, hits the spot perfectly with a stout.\n\nFlatbread Pizza with Homemade Mozzarella, Fresh Tomato Pomodoro and Basil - finally, a fucking pizza that doesn't come out of my ass the next morning in essentially the same form it went in my mouth, all burny and greasy.  A thin crust with dollops of mozzarella that will make you positively renounce your allegiance to lactose intolerance.  Tolerate it, baby, and eat this pizza.\n\nHerb Crusted Mac & Cheese with Southern Fried Drumettes and Smoked Chili Honey - after eating this three cheese delight (gruyere, cheddar and oaxaca) and sucking the marrow from these tiny, cute little drumettes with breading I wanted to kiss, I went home, took my boxes of mac and cheese from the grocery store and summarily shot them.  Bad food needs to be executed.  Good food, like this fine Tricks take on an old standard, needs to be given a medal.\n\nAntipasto of Cerignola Olives, Cured Meats and Artisan Cheeses - this needs no explanation because it is a standard dish, and by that I do not mean to say it isn't exceptional, but you should recognize that a lovely plate like this is simple and comforting during the draining of a nice Malbec.  I will say that the cheeses were fun, the olives divine and the salami, sliced thin, was amazingly mild, not too fatty or salty, and covered in a reduction of the sweetest sauce.  I wanted to put it on my nipples and lift my breasts to my mouth and lick it off.  Oh, wait, I don't have breasts, or prominent nipples, but I know from my time spent licking liquids from the prominent nipples of not-so-prominent women that this sauce would make even a nipple with an unnoticed, protruding stiff hair totally palatable.  Great dish.\n\nThai Barbecue Grilled Quail Skewers with Fire Roasted Mango and Szechuan Peppercorn - how can you go wrong eating a pheasantly bird from a stick.  This bird, known to move in short bursts, launched itself on to these long skewers just in time for my sixth Guinness and I thought I was playing matchmaker:  quail, meet beer, meet stomach.  Have fun.  Nothing about mango and quail is conceivably related but hoo-boy did this one hit the spot.  The bird melted down my esophagus.  Fuck you, chicken, I've found my poultry.  Now get back to the frozen food aisle and die again in a microwave.\n\nTrio of Green Chile Veal Breast Tacos with Pumpkin Seed Crema, Pico de Gallo and Queso Oaxaca - fine, I ate a little innocent veal.  And it felt so good.  If you just showed a picture of this dish to the veal in his pen, he would gladly continue on his thankless path to the grocery store.  Run a loop of my face in the vealhouse eating this sublime set of tacos and the little softie would smile at how happy he is going to make his human cousins.  Pumpkin is, in my experience, becoming better every year I stomp around this terra firma.  From pumpkin beers to roasted seeds to the standard pie to this Crema - pumpkin is dick.  \n\nSo, that's it.  The nicest outside bar I've been to anywhere and my five thousand characters are about to end.  \n\nEAT AT
2	The food here, in my experience, was below average.  I had the baby back ribs as did my dining mates.  We all found them to be extremely dry and not terribly delicious.  The other people in my party order the roast chicken.  Some of the like the roast chicken while others did not.  The artichoke dip, bread and chips that came out as appetizers were unflavorful and uninspiring.\n\nThe service was good, the owner was friendly and all the sports memorabilia was fun.  I don't think I will go back
4	With the plethora of grocery options in North Scottsdale, Basha's proves to be a very affordable option. We stop in every once and a while, and find the staff at this location to be very friendly.\n\nThe Basha's card really helps cut down the price on some items and helps us get great deals, such as Progresso Soups for $1. You can also purchase an inexpensive refillable cup and get refills for less than a dollar. Oh yeah, they have the BEST doughnuts and some pretty good pastries!
5	I came here one night when I was in Scottsdale for school. My classmates and I decided to just walk around. No doubt this place is really hidden! But once you are inside, it is actually a pretty big very dimly lit wine bar with tons and tons of options (over 1800 wines!). The waiters/waitresses are extremely knowledgable and the service was great. We ordered a bottle of Spanish red as well as olives and cheese. I forgot what kind of wine it was but it was really good. I am no wine connoisseur but I definitely enjoy Spanish wines. \r\n\r\nThis is a great place for a date, a group of friends for a quiet chat, and even just with one friend. Very private and intimate.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kazbar.net/
3	"""I've been meaning to check this place out for SOOOO long, just never got the chance. I wanted a warm meal, so I decided to go get me a cheesesteak. I went with the regular cheese steak and had them add grilled onions, mushrooms and sweet peppers. It was around $7.50 with the added veggies. It was pretty good, but the meat was underseasoned and there wasn't enough for the size of the roll (10 inch) I needed more onions than they gave me, but it was still a decent cheesesteak. I'll go back if I\m looking for a middle of the road cheesesteak,, but am sadly still on the hunt for the totally awesome cheesesteak here in the desert"""""""
5	"""YES!!!! THIS IS THE PLACE FOR BOOZEHOUNDS! I FRICKEN LOVE THIS PLACE! Seriously, if you are looking for a liquor store that has it all and has been \classified\"""" so it doesn't look like your average on the corner hobo filled booze store, then you will love this place! Honestly, if you can't find something you like here, you are a horrible person that no one likes because you are too dang high maintenance. Haha. Every time I have come here, I have been able to find exactly what I needed (well not necessarily needed but I felt that I needed it at the time). The store is organized nicely so you can find everything easily and the clerks really seem to know their alcohol cause every time I have asked about something, they know what they are talking about. Even if what you want (you high maintenance people) is not sold in this 800+ meca of wines and beers, the clerks still seem like they would know what it is and why they don't have it. For instance, my step-mom wanted some wine she had sampled at Olive Garden a few weeks prior to us going there. She didn't know the name but the guy we spoke with there knew exactly what we were talking about and informed us that the supplier for OG was not yet selling that wine to total wine and more but they were working on getting it. He quickly suggested another wine they did have that was very close in taste. Wow, this guy's brain was like a vast empire of wine knowledge! Anyways, another great thing about this place is they are way cheaper than Bevho and they also have a bigger selection of mini liquors. This came in handy for the gift bags I made for a bachelorette party I was hosting which then came in handy for when the bars were closing down and we still wanted to get our drink on. So to wrap this up, if you are a boozer, alcoholic, boozehound, or just the average everyday citizen that likes to have a drink here or there from a flask (yes they have many of them!), this is the place for you! This place is like Disneyland for drunkards! Oh and they have wine tastings for the rich classy folks! Haha"""""""
5	I have 231 reviews so far and none for one of my all time favorite AZ restaurants? I have to rectify that now. If you love wine and bruschetta than this will be your own version of Heaven. Blasphemy? Then you've never been to Postino! Seriously, they have the best bruschetta you're likely to ever have in your entire life. My top four: \n\n1) Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone\n2) Brie & Apples with Fig Spread\n3) Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese\n4) Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes\n\nAlso worthy of mention are the amazing sandwiches. I highly recommend the Autostrada (Sopresatta, Italian ham, cappicola, mortadella, provolone, arugula and tomatoes with spicy pepper relish) and the Nine Iron (Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise). Fucking awesome.\n\nAs you'll read in most of the other reviews, Postino has a great Monday and Tuesday night special, a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board for only $20. But be warned, it'll be jam packed. Keep in mind they have two other locations as well. For you east valley residents there is a new Gilbert loction. If you are in downtown Phoenix or west valley, then the Central Avenue location a couple blocks north of Camelback will be more convenient.\n\nWith its outstanding food, decor, and ambiance, I'm going to give you a Paul V. guarantee that you will love Postino.
5	I've lived in the Phoenix area for eight years and have eaten at dozens of different Mexican places looking for the best food. Rosita's Place has consistently come out on top. Their refried beans are the best I've ever eaten. Let me say that again: their refried beans are the best I've ever eaten. I like their carne asada burrito and their green chili is also good. \n\nThe building looks a little worn from the outside, but inside it's very clean and the service is always good. I wish they had other locations because it's a long drive from where I live in Chandler.
3	I think that Pick Up Stix uses much better quality ingredients than Panda Express and many other Asian fast food chains and is fairly affordable given the quality. Their lunch special is a particularly good deal - you get a choice between 3-4 specific meat dishes, a choice of wontons or egg rolls, a choice between different rices or chow mein, and a drink for $6.99. The House Special Chicken has a really flavorful sauce and is great combined with sauteed veggies (for $1 more), and the crab wontons are much better than ones I've had at many Asian restaurants that have kind of a fishy or overly creamy filling. However, echoing what some people have already said, the noodle dishes are not great here and should probably be avoided.
5	I was looking for a neighborhood joint that wasn't a chain and I found one with Lux.  \n\nIt's a neighborhood coffee in the truest sense. You've got all your regular characters - dude who looks like Jesus, hippie chick in her cool hippie skirt, aspiring artists (one overweight hipster even wearing a beret), couples pulling up on bicycles, old guys reading the paper. Truly local people with a sense of silent comaraderie - you just KNOW not to be yapping on your cell in there.\n\nYou can feel comfortable and feel like you can disappear for a few hours.  Good, solid espresso drinks, free WiFi.  If you live in the area, you should definitely be a patron and support this local spot (as opposed to Starbucks down the street on Lola up the street).  \n\nI dig it.
4	"""After a very nerve-wracking interview for a position in Japan held in Downtown Phoenix on a Friday night, my family decided it might be a good idea to head over to Sens to help me relax. Seems appropriate, right? Well, we were huge fans of the old Fate restaurant before they changed it into some commercialized abomination... luckily,  we had heard that Johnny Chu started a couple of other places that had been left untouched. Fans of Mr. Chu, we decided to give Sens a try, hoping that all of those great times at Fate could be revived ;)\n\nWhile Sens certainly isn't the same, it was still a breath of fresh air. It is definitely unique and innovative, and definitely not traditional... but that's okay too! The prices were a bit high, but for 4 of us we were actually surprised by how \cheap\"""" the final bill was. It wasn't really cheap, but way cheaper than we had anticipated.\n\nWe had some GREAT drinks, one of which was a very strong Japanese vodka infused with Lychee fruit. I don't think I really would order it again, but it was pretty good! Just not my type of drink... extremely strong-tasting! \n\nFor food, since they do mostly \""""family style\"""" dishes where everyone at the table shares, we all ordered a few different things to try out. Pretty much everything except for the riblets was great! I don't really like pork or beef anyway, but these were especially unappealing to me. However, the Wagyu (Japanese beef) they served was very tasty, and I usually hate beef! We got our own binchotan grill, but the waiter helped us out with cooking the beef since we had never done it before.\n\nOther than that, I can't really remember the names of what we ordered... but it was all good! (Except for those riblets...) The staff was awesome, it wasn't too busy, very small but comfortable, and the DJ was pretty awesome. He was a really nice guy, and I think he did some DJing at Fate a few years ago too. Not sure though. The music was also pretty cool!"""""""
5	Thanks to all the yelpers whose reviews prompted a date night trip to Thai Rama! Woo-freakin-hoo!!!!\n\nWe started with the beef satay, which was out of this world. Perfectly seasoned and barbecued meat that was non stop good. I had the Panang Curry with medium heat and was completely wowed.  Hubby's meal - a completely unpronounceable chicken dish with cashews, peanuts, water chestnuts, onion and pepper was similarly amazing. Medium heat that was right on and a non-curry sauce that was to die for. \n\nNeither one of us wanted to stop eating, but we did and were able to bring home leftovers...With tea, appy, meals and tip the whole thing came to 35 bucks!  OH MY G!! We are so totally going back. .. And we'll use the drive through window too! GO. Its totally worth the trip.
4	This place has pretty awesome food!  I had the cocino soup and it was both tasty and authentic.  The soup had big chunks of potato and beef.   The chips and salsa took a little bit of getting used too (tomato paste like). But then the salsa became adicting.  \n\nIt was band night so it got pretty loud.  They play country music on one side and have a dj on the other.  The part of town is sketchy like someone said but keep in mind the police station is right down the street.  Give this place a shot it's pretty tasty!
4	GREAT SPOT - LOCALLY OWNED & IT SHOWS!!!\n\nthe Owner Oz is great & take's pride in his establishment... they keep the menu pretty fresh with new items always popping in for the season and they have my favorite local micro-brew - ORANGE BLOSSOM!!!  \n\nTheir Happy Hour is the REAL DEAL - Try the Pulled Pork Sandwich while your there\n\nWhen you're looking for a great spot to watch Football on the weekends this is as good as it gets - Jumbo screens and multiple TV's with multiple bar setups & it's close to Tempe but not directly slammed in all the traffic - which is a plus to me. Great bar to catch a BEARS game at on Sundays and a University of Texas spot on Sat's but I'm Michigan so ya won't find me there :)\n\nFor those that need a patio like myself - prepare yourself... its freaking HUGE & looks out across the courtyard. If you're trying to switch it up from the typical Oldtown Weekend and don't want to go as far as Mill It has a pretty decent night life - doubles up as a club / lounge late night on some weekdays & weekends - great DJ's & they even get some pretty decent live entertainment.\n\nDef worth a stop if you're in the area whether its just for a quick drink before a movie or you're having a full meal.
2	This time we were out there and order 3 dishes.  I was  a little dismayed since they charged me $12.95 for the crab last time and Chinese newspaper said the special is $7.95.  So we ordered lobster, steam gray sole, snow peas greens, and gingered lamb.  All are delicious except the lamb was spoiled.  When I told them this is unacceptable, they told me that they just bought it from the market and it came from Australia so it isn't gamy but why does lamb tasted sour?  They still made me paid for it which angered me.  That said, the service was slow and they apologized for that but serving spoiled food to anyone is totally unacceptable in any situation.
4	I used to hang out here alot in my high school days, and when my wife and I were dating. I really like the place. It is a part of our community in avondale, people just like to chill here! The owners, and staff are all family. They are some really cool people, and like to get to know the people who walk in. I have become friends with a few of them.\n\nNow about the food.\n\nMost pizza places like this have a very different tasting pizza than your everyday Pizza Hut pizzas, but I really like the pizza here. It has a different taste I crave for sometimes but for the most part I mostly go to pizza hut. The wings are good but I've had better. Still good though! I think for the most part you should try it if you are around  town. I see some people LOVE this place, and some people who are like me and just come here when they crave that different taste.
4	I swear I am here every frikkin weekend for one reason or another.  This place, like all the other Home Depots, offers everything under the sun for the home and provides excellent service when you can track down a sales associate.\n\nThe thing I hate about this place, and I know it probably isn't their fault, is the parking lot.  It is one of the most horrific layouts every conceived.  The perimeter is a maze of bullsht and I almost get in an accident every time.  I would literally slap whoever came up with the design.
5	I love the library.  This is my local branch, and frequent here often.  Membership is free, as long as you are a local resident.  Some of the benefits include computer usage, checking out books, all the local standard library stuff that you would expect.\n\nWhat I love about this place is that they are open 7 days a week, and late during the week (I think until 8 PM.)  I love going here on Sundays to check my email on the computer, etc.  I think you can print here for 20 cents a page or something.  Plus, the staff here seems to be efficient and so far, has answered all of my questions when asked.
4	First off, I'll admit that this is the only place I'll take my ride too in Down Town Phx. Of course, to be unbiased, that's because its the only place to take your ride too in DT Phx. So, let's be real. 2nd'ly, I drive a Tahoe on big rim's. It's not the easiest thing to clean, and i refuse to do it myself (my own laziness gets a 1 star for car washing, I'm awesome but not THAT awesome). Also, it's black. So double dipper here. The service is fast and friendly, which i love. Danny's needs to take a group field trip here to learn customer service! LO's defiantly has the upper hand in the area. And for the price (i pay about $20 for the works wash every time) it cant be beat and i cant be too sour on it. It's really just minor things; sometimes they forget to wipe out the deep dish rim's thoroughly, or there are minor water spots, or little stains left on the wood grain. Nothing really major, but I just expect perfection every time (which I'm well aware that would only happen if i washed myself, and most likely it wouldn't happen because my ADD would kick in half way through and I would be driving a half dirty half clean whip around town). Also, they have a punch card as well which is very nice! Buy 10, get Numero 11 free. All in All, defiantly 1.5 thumbs up from me; hoping for a full 2 soon.
4	This is in a great location in central phoenix near the light rail and Heritage Square. It is a smaller British themed pub. My girlfriend and I stopped in on a Sunday to partake in an afternoon of football and drinks. It was a great balance for us since I enjoy the fruitier, lighter drinks like the $3 mimosa's, while my girlfriend sipped on the reasonably priced import brews. Inside it was sectioned into 4 different areas to include two bar style seating areas, a game room of sorts and a dinning room all centered around T.V.'s. It was great for watching the game we went to watch and keeping tabs of the other teams playing. The staff was accommodating and changed the T.V. to one of the less popular games at our request. I sunk into a big leather chair near a window facing the outdoor area of the pub. There was outdoor games and BBQ in celebration of the afternoon games. While I'm not really a football fan, the staff and atmosphere made my afternoon not only bearable, but enjoyable!
4	This place is such a find. Let's start with the chips & salsa because that's really what melts my butter. Perfection! chips were thin, crispy, hot. The salsa was the perfect consistency, not the Hot Ketchup variety & none of that we opened a jar of Pace Picante, hahaha these stupid gringos!  I mean, honestly, my Mexican food standards are not that demanding. Give me the same quality I could make at home without having to drag out my food processor & I'm your best friend. \n\nRice & beans were good, typical, but good. Tortillas are exactly like my grandma's, probably full of lard (sorry if they're not but I don't see this place making the Jenny Craig hitlist anyway). And lard is necessary to build your quality cellulite. That, and butter slathered on the lard laden tortillas; now the clouds have parted. \n\nI ordered the chile relleno plate and the chile relleno was very satisfactory - the batter could be a tad flufflier but, hey, who's measuring. On another visit, I ordered the chicken taco. The chicken was moist & shredded, very good. are the hard shells handmade? I detected a slight comparison to Lawry's but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I love the shredded lettuce on everything. It's very Baja & makes me feel a little better about the fact that I've completed reversed the effects of 4 hours of Insanity Workout. \n\nThe person who complained about the service should go to Macayo's or Arriba's (excuse me as I hork all over my keyboard). Ok, better now. if you are looking more streamlined, corporate, dining process, these places will be little gems for you. (heheheee)
4	"""We love Italian food done right!  Living in Scottsdale for the past five years, we hadn't found an Italian restaurant that we could call \home\"""" until a friend recommended La Torretta . . . and now, I'm hooked!  \n\nFrom the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted with warm and friendly service, and it doesn't stop there.  The owners of La Torretta are on site, and everything oozes \""""mom and pop\"""" and \""""son\"""" . . . Compare that with the two opposing corners of busy Scottsdale Road and Frank Lloyd Wright which house two of the largest cookie-cutter chain Italian restaurants in the area.  La Torretta is hands down, head and shoulders above the rest!  \n\nThe portions are hearty, but not overwhelmingly so, and they are more than willing to do things to your specifications or whim!  Big high fives for the butternut squash ravioli that melts in your mouth.  The clams oreganate (on the appetizer menu) is enough for a meal, especially when you have to lap up every drop off the sauce. \n\nOne more thing that sets La Torretta in a different class is that the owners care about their clientele and they often give back to their community by offering special menus with proceeds benefitting local charities.  In such difficult economic times, it is such a rarity to find such generosity.\n\nBravo to La Torretta!"""""""
4	When one course of a meal is so significantly better than the rest of it, it's hard to write a balanced review.  I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesn't have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess it's supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French.\n\nSo the meal didn't start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, it's a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware I'm using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didn't notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed.\n\nThat was when they pulled out dessert.\n\nI'm not a sweets person.  I don't know that I've ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just don't have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  I'd also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag.\n\nI have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again.\n\nBefore I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didn't take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here.\n\nWhile it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.  I can see (if I had a real life, not one that consisted solely of studying) sitting out on their patio, enjoying Phoenix, and making a dent in their wine and cheese stocks.
4	"""I love a good bargain I really do !  I love a bargain on great quality  stuff even better.  Sometimes the Rack is  a huge disappointment , no deals,  clothing that doesn't  \hit\"""" me,  and  blah\n\nBut not tonight kids!  We had a great time shopping.  Bought several items for cheap , ata fraction of the cost in Nordstroms. \n\nIt seems to me the best way to shop at The rack is with no agenda.  When we go in looking for a specific item , it's never found. But go in \ncheck out the racks and you will find surprises.  Many items will have tags with 30-50%  off the last item markdown. For instance a 140.00 jacket had been marked down several times and with 35% off, I got it for \n14.00 bucks.  You just never know!"""""""
5	I wanted to update my review on their pint ice cream. since it's not like the Rep is super close to me I now have to get pints, ok i dont HAVE to but, ya I kinda do.\n\nso, usually after you freeze ice cream for awhile or its been in the freezer a long time it gets pretty gross. ice crystally and maybe a little ooey sticky around the edges. ya know what im talkin about? \n\nthe Reps ice cream stays amazing. im not lying. it stays amazing. buy pints. they will sell ya a pint of whatever you want if they have it so fill up!! i spent $30 (i know yikes!) on pints not too long ago but I haven't had to go back  in a long time bc their pints don't go bad like grocery ice cream. so i get to enjoy the Rep at home!
5	Black Market Minerals is the only reason I go to the Arizona Mills Mall anymore.  It is the last good store standing at this ghetto gangster/ vato hotspot. It has a wide assortment of beads, African drums/masks, decorative mirrors, stones, and jewelry. \n\n I could spend forever in this store just wandering around. My favorite items there include their large African Masks. I bought 3 of them for my apartment at about $14 each. They also have some awesome sun mirrors, wooden and mosaic ones.\n\nEven if you don't have any money to buy anything (as most of the people hanging around this mall rarely do), just stop in and look around...you won't regret it.
5	I haven't tried the Carne Asada here yet (but I know I will be back to do so) but all I can say is BEST BEAN & CHEESE BURRITO EVER!!!\n\nAfter reading some reviews on yelp I decided to go and pick up lunch at America's.  The parking was a bit tricky to figure out at first, and I wouldn't recommend going after you get your car washed or if it is raining because it is just a dusty, dirt lot; but once I got inside and got my burrito, all was forgotten.\n\nThey advertise that they don't use any lard in their beans...and well, lard is usually what makes the beans so creamy and delicious; so I was intrigued.  Well upon my first bite, I was not missing the lard at all!  The tortilla was so fresh and delicious, and the beans, oh the beans, were creamy and had just the right amount of melted Monterrey jack cheese mixed in with them.  I was in heaven...and for only $3.25....this is definitely a budget friendly and waistline friendly meal!  \n\nP.S. I only ate half of the burrito to start with, and then ate the other half later cold....it was almost even better cold!\n\nI will be back...and next time...I will try to force myself to try the carne asada!
5	I used to frequent Stinkweeds in Tempe, almost on a weekly basis. I don't listen to mainstream music so when I found the store years back, I was overjoyed and almost in tears. The staff here are extremely knowledgeable in finding you the most obscure, interesting music. If you're into experimental music, this would be a great place to shop for.\n\nSome of the CD's I got here:\nDeer Hoof\nSunny Day Real Estate\nThe Flaming Lips\nModest Mouse (before they went mainstream)\nQueens of the Stone Age\nPixies (Anything Frank Black)\nAnd 80 more....\n\nTwo thumbs - way up!
4	Came here for breakfast yesterday, it had been years since I have stopped in here and do not remember the entire place having waiter service.  Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.
1	This is my second time visitng since we live in the area.  The first time was average and the second and last time to visit was disgustingly unprofessional.  The overly loud and uninviting climate of the restaurant masks the distinguishing and historical architecture. I was very excited to be revisitng the place to discover more about it, but it all changed...\n\n  Most of all, the service was outright unprofessional and rude.  After making a huge attempt to go out of our way to be kind to the waiter, he just kept barking at us and insulted us.  This extremely angry person ruined every shred of your dignity.\n\nA plead to Hanny's management: i know most of your clientele are tourists, but to keep locals coming back, please hire persons who actually want to work there in the service industry.
5	I would hardly call this a hike. This is straight up rock climbing minus the harness and helmet! If you have a fear of heights, I don't suggest this route. What an adventure though! I couldn't believe some of the ages of little kids climbing. The trail we chose (Echo) was awesome, scary, difficult and rewarding all in one. There are two points on the mountain with handrails. I suggest using them. My boyfriend climbed up the mountain like some sort of monkey--no fear. I was a bit more cautious, planning out my every step. Oh, and on the way down, don't be afraid to go on your butt. Overall it was a great workout and a fun time. I can't wait to go back next time I'm visiting Arizona.
3	"""My friend and I went on Friday night for a girls night out so we decided to start our night here. The place was on a short wait and it was packed! Almost to a point where it was not enjoyable, so keep that in mind if you want a place for conversation. We had sake bombers, which were great as always and a, what we thought was complimentary (four square check in) edamame appetizer and then ordered the calamari. The calamari was amazing! Then we had sushi with these fried shrimps on top and they were amazing! There was some confusion on our other sushi order and it came out wrong. When we asked the snobby server to fix it, we got the \eye roll\"""" but she took it back to fix it. The check came and it was about $85 for both of us, the server still charged us for the edamame and the service pretty much stunk as we saw her about 3 times. I hate tipping less than 20% so I didn't, but the server didn't deserve the $18 tip I felt compelled to leave. I would come back, but maybe at a different time because it was so loud and crowded. I personally enjoy more of a quiet dining experience."""""""
1	We went there with the expectation of seeing girls swinging from the rafters. No girls swinging from rafters, and after looking up, I didn't really  see any rafters, maybe the lighting. What I did see was a lot of men, biker types, not my scene. It was a Friday and pretty busy, but just too loud to even have a conversation. Finally we saw two girls that were waitresses, dressed normal, but still no chicks swinging from rafters. So after about a half hour of this, we left.
4	I like Discount Tires a lot, and their front desk staff has always been courteous.  My line of work results in more than the usual number of tire problems, and Discount Tire is always ready to help me out with a swapout while I wait. \n\nSo, generally, they're aces.  That being said, something happened there yesterday which prompted me dock them a star and to write the following:\n\nOpen Letter To The Guy Who Changed My Tire At Discount Tires: \n\nI drive a grotty, dirty farm-trashed 2001 CR-V in which the CD and tape players are broken, so radio is my only music option on the road.  I'll admit, my choices of station presets are pretty predictable for a 40ish lady - NPR, a classical station, the rest alternative/classic rock crap, just background noise. \n\nIn that light, your decision to change not one but EVERY SINGLE PRESET on my radio to Latino stations?  Was clearly not just for your own work-time enjoyment, but rather bespoke a well-meaning mission to enlighten me as to the finer points of Tejano and mariachi.  Sadly, however, my aversion to accordian and trumpet music - especially when combined  - is permanent and abiding.  So, thanks anyway; even though your suggestions didn't take root, I'd like to pass along my gratitude for your thoughtfulness!  Not to mention that the time it took you to reprogram those stations (since mine is an old system and requires old-school dial-turning) was probably as much as was actually required for the tire swap itself - and with an hour and a half backlog on your service schedule, your taking the time to amend my bland radio situation only offers further proof of how dedicated you are to serving your customers' cultural as well as automotive needs!\n\n(P.S.  But honestly, now...  It was me, the relaxed girl with the shabby ride who left you to your work and didn't come back until after you were done, to whom you felt it necessary to be an ass?  Not the guy with a $50K car and a snotty attitude about having to wait?  Lo que sea, hombre.)\n .
5	Delicious and inexpensive, exactly like Chinese place in NY (except the egg rolls are small). The soups are dead on as is the cuisine. My favorite is the Boneless Rib Tips and Egg Foo Young. The Pork Fried Rice is delicious. The Roast Pork and Vegetables is also perfect. Here is a hint go for an early dinner 2:55pm and order a lunch special for 5 bux. The one negative is the Sesame Chicken is not the same as you are used to, very garlic-ey. The family meal is well worth the $29.99 price and will get you stuffed and feeds 5-8, I'd say!\nOverall DELICIOUS AND CHEAP!\n** WAY BETTER THAN CHEN'S OR MOON CHINA.....**
4	This place is great for vegans and vegetarians. For you first timers, I'd suggest grabbing menus near the register then find a seat. When ready take it up to the register and order. They'll give you a # and then your food will be brought out. The wait may be a little long but it's made fresh so obviously. The green tea is very good! Best I've had! The TLT is delish and the pasta salad with kale is awesome! The atmosphere is chill and laid back, and the wait staffs cool too. Jackie, you're awesome! Stop by and support your local cafe. You'll enjoy it, me and my family sure did! Only 4 stars because of parking.
1	"""I provided Honey Bears with a review I was going to submit, but based on that interaction I modified the review to provide a different slant - constructive ideas for their business.\n\n1. Customer service and satisfaction - when I explained that we did not receive baby back ribs on 1/20/2012 from their Tempe location, I was told that we must be mistaken since they had changed ribs weeks before. I requested a credit for just half a slab of real baby backs as compensation. Having been a regular customer of their chicken sandwiches for over a decade, we were astounded that our request so far has been ignored.\n2. The cashiers would benefit from training much like what McDonalds provides its employees. A friendly \how are you today\"""" or \""""what can we do for you\"""" would suffice.\n3. Change out the dated green tinted TV that people watch while waiting in the line. Sit down customers do have several flat screens to watch.\n4. Hire a lighting designer to make the interior more appealing. Lowering light in parts of the restaurant would give it more character and make it more appealing.\n5. Get a better cash register. Seems like the cashiers have always complained about this brand of computerized register.\n\nHopefully this will help. And hopefully Honey Bears has moved to real fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs - ones that we did experience at their Central location, but not at their Tempe location."""""""
3	There is NOTHING spectacular about this place, well outside of the building itself that is. The patio is awesome and the interior is pretty freakin' cool to.\n\nThat said, I went here because of the weeks on end that this place was the top of the Yelp charts and I was sadly underwhelmed. Not that there is anything wrong with this place it's just not anything I'd claim to be out of this world.\n\nI had a peperoni pizza and it's nowhere in the league of Pizza A Metro or Cibo ... it's just plain old pizza ... nothing great ...
3	This place has a lived-in, part-of-the-neighborhood feel that I really enjoy.  And if you want to see an artist at work, watch them perfectly land burger patties on the charcoal grill from several feet away, bing-bang-boom, one after the other, and none of them out of place.   The results are delicious...except for the buns.   This seems like a terrible place for a hamburger joint to economize, but they have.  The buns are dry and flavorless, which is a real shame, because it takes away from what would otherwise be an outstanding burger.
5	Wow!  Their cocktail list blew me away.  So rare to find a place with a well rounded list of old school cocktails!  Each one is like a pice of art crafted to make you smile.  After the aperitif this place keeps me happy with outstanding food.  Bacon Popcorn: Delish.  Olives: Excellent to nibble with cocktails.  Mac & Cheeze: American standard done well here.  Chicken and Waffles: Gluten free and tasty.  Short Ribs: Big portion and well prepared.  Scallops: A savory take on this normally light dish.  Pudding Dessert: Hit the spot.  Best meal I've had in a long time!
2	I went to this place with family. The service was ok and food was ok but I had a rice water in a large sized cup. The beverage was full of cinnamon at first I was really thirsty so I thought nothing of it. When I got home about 3 hours later I thought I was having a mental breakdown. My head felt weird like I was losing my mind... In short I did some research online and it says that cinnamon is a mild hallucinogenic like ecstasy. So I don't know if it was the drink or the food. I will not be going back to this place ever.
5	This place is absolutely awesome.  Everything you read in the other reviews is true.  Pastys are hot pockets of pastry filled with love.  I had the peppered steak pasty with the peppercorn brandy sauce and it was amazing.  My server Justin was awesome, very friendly and understanding that this was my first visit.  The location in Tempe is small but full of character.  Sit at the bar and watch the food being made.  Even the cooks were friendly and willing to talk about what they were doing.\n\nAbsolutely have an Irish Car bomb (Guinness with a shot of Jameson whiskey and Bailey's Irish Cream).  They are only $3 a day, every day!!!\n\nThe place is a bit hard to find but it's totally worth the work.  Your efforts will be rewarded.
3	It's amazing how easy it is to overlook reviewing places you frequent - just was headed to lunch and wondering what reviews said about The Lunch Break.  Surprised to find no reviews (however, it is off the beaten path for most I think - more of an industrial park breakfast and lunch stop).\n\nThe Lunch Break is just that - a small breakfast and lunch spot tucked into an industrial park.  The current owner, Darryl, has worked hard to improve the menu and facilities.  He has added tasty hot sandwiches and expanded their patio to be more comfortable on those nice days.  It's one of those places that if you frequent enough they will greet you by name (I frequent so often, and order the same thing so much that they sometimes have it made and ready before I get to the front of the line!).\n\nDefinitely a recommend for an easy/quick lunch without eating fast food.  Good sandwiches and salads!
5	A friend and I decided to try this place after all the good reviews we read and it was awesome food. We started with the stuffed grape leaves which there were six of them and very tasty. Then we shared the gyros, chicken and beef kabob combination plate which serves two and came with a big plate of rice. All I can say is we were in heaven while eating this..everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We had a little rice and gyros leftover so the waitress packaged it up and filled the to go box with rice and extra sauce and pita..which came out to a full meal in itself. The place is a little small but filled up quickly and service was friendly and we never had to ask for anything. If your craving Greek food treat yourself to Eden's
4	Stopped in here today with Robyn N. for the Lunch Buffet.  Things have slipped just slightly from the best it has been here, as the Mongolian BBQ which used to have 8 meats (!) is not down to five, & the total food item count is down to 140 from it's peak of 150, not counting sauces & dressings.  ALSO, some of the other Chinese Buffets around the Valley such as certain locations of Hibachi & China City are just so good that the competition is really getting tough for this long-established place.\n\nWith that said, Crazy Buffet here slips down to 4 Stars for right now, but I'm certainly still a fan of this friendly, comfortable place that serves up delicious food at a reasonable price, and still including TEN kinds of ice cream!     :-))\n\nWeekday Lunch Buffet $7.99/$7.19 Sr.
5	This place deserves the accolades.  As far as I've found, it is the best bar in the greater Phoenix area.  The huge patio space and limited interior means that it's friendly to both smokers and non-smokers, which I think has had a large part in their popularity.  It also just seems to attract an interesting crowd, and I think that's what really makes it different.\n\nEvery bar attracts a specific average of people.  Casey Moore's tends to attract those involved in creative fields like theatre, film, music, etc.  I don't want to say this means any one thing, but it really does make the place more interesting.  If you are creatively inclined, you are far more likely to meet someone you might actually like as a human being there, and that means a lot.
4	Came in with the family today, it's been awhile since our last visit.\n\nWe ordered the Stray Kitty on White with Tuna, a brownie, and the Half Red Bird\n\nI ate the tuna and just loved it, quite tantalizing. The wife enjoyed her red bird as well. And the brownie? Forget about it  - spectacular!! Didn't stand a chance. Ha\n\nOnly challenge was our cashier (young female) seemed put out by our questions about the menu.\n\nI would have no hesitation recommending this restaurant to friends.
4	"""Really fun atmosphere.  Good music.  Dark and intimate.  Large private booths are perfect for chillin' with a group of friends.  The food is heavy and the portions are very very large.  I am not in love with the fish dishes.  But the meat dishes are really tasty - I had the most fantastic pork tenderloin here...  this is a nice place to take out-of-towners for a casual upscale meal with local flavor and atmosphere.\n\nIn the spirit of full disclosure, I would like to add there I don't consider much of the menu to be true \cuisine of New Mexico\"""".  I am from New Mexico, so I know what I am talking about. (fyi - Carlsbad Tavern in South Scottsdale is the most authentic New Mexico cuisine I have had in the Valley).  As Omer notes, it is smoky and the food is hit or miss.  I came here for lunch and was not at all impressed.  However, I was won over when I came here for dinner with a group of friends.  This is a fun place at night and several dishes are quite good."""""""
4	"""so i've heard this place is \as good\"""" as bianco's....i wouldn't know because on principle alone, i absolutely, definitively REFUSE to stoke the ego and elitism of anyone req'ing me to wait 2 hours to eat their food. \n\nthe place is cute and has plenty of room to avoid a 2 hour wait....and the pizza was good. wood oven baked so it had that little burnt crispy edge. we had the mahhhhgahhhhrita pizza and it was enough to stave our pizza crave. and then we indulged in their version of the desert pizza cookie. although quite bigger than oregano's, it wasn't as sweet, but altogether still tasty! \n\nfor our pizza, half the desert, a glass of wine....20 bucks for 2 people!"""""""
3	"""I love just about any mom & pop Chinese place that offers lunch combos.  These places tend to fit in a tight range.  How much variation (good or bad) can you possibly introduce into egg drop soup, fried rice, and egg rolls?  Szechuan Cuisine was no exception, although I'd put it towards the upper end of that tight range.\n\nThe place was absolutely empty on Friday around noon.  The dining room was clean, and the lighting was bright.  The Chinese zodiac place mats were right out of central casting.  (Good to know that I'm still a snake.)  There was an unusually large number of lunch combos, and they even made \Chicken & Broccoli\"""" into a combo for my friend.  (His tastes aren't very exotic.)\n\n$6 got me the Szechuan Chicken combo.  The egg drop soup was below average, without tofu or many vegetables.  The chicken dish was pretty typical, although you don't get to eat \""""wood ear\"""" every day.  The egg roll was solid, and the steamed rice was perfectly cooked and unusually tasty.  The one unique thing about my meal was the salad alongside the entree.  The raw cabbage was a pleasant textural change, but the spicy, fish-flavored dressing didn't work for me.\n\nTo sum up, Szechuan Cusine's lunch combos offer good variety, good portions, and good value, but nothing spectacular.  (For a very different and delicious lunch experience, try the similarly named Szechuan Garden just one mile away.)  I'd still  like to try the more authentic offerings that are in the 2nd half of the menu.  Other reviewers rave about them.  I'll have to come back for dinner some time."""""""
2	W went to Tryst Cafe with high expectations we were not impressed. The woman at the door and the busboys are the greatest asset of this restaurant. Very friendly and sincere. Other than that service was mediocre! We had the pineapple upside down pancakes which had no upside downness at all! No brown sugar and no sauce! Just pancakes with pineapple in them. Boring!!! Then their bacon is blanched (pre-cooked) tasted like a dog treat. Other than that the breakfast was nothing better than what I can make in my own kitchen. Raise the bar Tryst Cafe, do something worth coming back for.
1	I ordered the following:\n\nShrimp Fried Rice, Curry Chicken/Chow Mein Combo, and two orders of Crab Wontons.\n\nThe Shrimp Fried Rice was Burned -- the smell and taste and just looking at the egg and the tip of the grains were complete proof of this -- the Curry Chicken was all sauce and no veggies -- barely any chicken -- and the Chow Mein was not Chow Mein, but Lo Mein. Believe me, I know most people get this wrong, but there is a difference.\n\nAnd on top of all of this, they failed to bring any chopsticks. WHO EATS RICE OR NOODLES WITHOUT CHOPSTICKS?\n\nAnd all of this was for....I don't know, like 26 or 27 dollars? I can't really say for sure. They failed to even bring me a reciept.\n\nSigh....I really think I should apply to work there in their kitchen. I may be just a simple white, American girl, but I know how to cook REAL Chinese food. I used to work in a Chinese Kitchen. And I was trained by real Chinese Chefs.\n\n\nBig Bowl,. if you are reading this: YOU NEED ME IN YOUR KITCHEN. \n\n\nAnyways, enough about me disappointing experience. Carry on.\n\n\n-Jadis
4	"""This was my favorite experience of my trip to the Phoenix area.  I have visited ASU a few times, and have always wanted to visit \A\"""" mountain and finally got my chance. The hike is moderate. I actually did it in flip flops because I forgot real shoes and I was fine, just watch your footing on the stairs at the very top of the mountain. The views are beautiful and the breeze at the top of the butte is very rewarding! College students and families alike were taking the ~1 mile uphill hike to the top of the butte."""""""
4	Now although I am not a fan of the location on Dunlap, I am a fan of the location on Camelback. I am not sure if they are run by the same people however at this location you do not need to turn your purse in at the door before you are allowed to look around the store. However their staff is walking around and checking on things to help deter any theft which is great!\n\nI shop at this location from time to time as its a little bit closer than their competition and alot smaller. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and their selection of products for black women is not quite as large as their competition but all in all not bad. So if you are looking for another beauty supply besides Sally's check out this particular United Beauty Supply location.
5	"""This place is great! We came here for a company event (~30 people) as we were staying around the corner at the Westin for a few days. We had a cocktail hour in the bar area and then a 3 course dinner in a private section. From start to finish the dinner was flawless and well executed. Definitely one of the best \work event\"""" dinners I've had. \n\nThe atmosphere was very modern, sleek and totally unexpected for a steak and seafood place. I really enjoyed it but once we were seated I saw little of it since we were partitioned away from the rest of the restaurant by huge curtains. \n\nThe cocktail hour started with sushi, sashmi tuna nachos, huge cocktail shrimp, and a couple others. I loved the nachos the best but everything was pretty good and great finger foods (not too messy/difficult to eat). I also had one of the gin martinis off the menu which was very good.. but strong. \n\nMy only complaint is that the appetizers didn't seem to be cohesive with the dinner courses. They were a lot heavier than the apps but equally delicious. I had caesar salad to start which was good as far as caesar salad goes. Filet for main course with family-style sides of mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and string beans. I liked that they perfectly cooked the steaks for each guest the way they liked and the servers had no trouble keeping track of everyone's steaks. The family style sides were also great so that we were able to all try a little of everything. Finally, I had the signature butter cake which is unlike anything I've ever had. It tasted like a sugar cookie turned into a soft cake and it had a nice caramelized crust on the outside. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and I'm glad we finished our trip in Arizona here."""""""
5	For my second visit to Crust, I convinced my friends who are also mothers of twins to go and have our girls night.  We had an awesome time.  The pizza rustica is so delicious.  I wolfed it down so fast I didn't realize I had no left overs for my husband to take home.  We were having such a great time and a nice couple on the next table decided to buy our wine bottles. That was a really sweet gesture. I can't wait to come back.  Actually, I am going to check out their new restaurant on Tatum and Bell.  Our server mentioned it opened a couple of days ago.  That branch is closer to us and I was told Toni, the guy at the oven making the pizzas will be there.
4	"""Our visit certainly didn't start off well, standing ignored in the entryway until I literally flagged down a server to ask if we seat ourselves or what. We then escorted ourselves to a corner table where we sat ignored for over five minutes, to the point of deliberating leaving. But hell, we were hungry. Damn hungry. A frazzled server finally responded to my SO's desperate arm-waving tactics. I'm still not certain why she was frazzled - the place was reasonably busy, but not even full, and there was tons of staff wandering around. \n\nOne sip of the freshly juiced OJ and my SO was sold. It was delicious, fresh and velvety. The menu is basic, and the prices average. I ended up with four-cheese quiche and toast, my SO with bacon, eggs, and blueberry pancakes. The quiche was fluffy and cheesy at once, its texture a little odd but somewhat addictive. The wheat toast was light yet hearty and fatty here sucked down all of it. My SO's bacon looked quite lovely, and he concurred - delicious - and he was over the moon about the pancakes. The coffee was surprisingly good, not requiring three Splendas. tons of cream, and an ice cube to make it edible. \n\nAfter we pretty much licked every crumb from the table, my SO went to the bathroom to beautify. The server stopped by and said, \You two are so cute and smiley, so not Scottsdale,\"""" in a sad, wistful way. \""""Nope,\"""" I replied, \""""we're from Phoenix\"""". Poor thing. I tipped her extra for having to deal with snotty Scottsdale pricks all the time.\n\nDowntrodden servers and questionable service aside, the food was delicious and I can bet we'll be back whenever we're back in the land of the cougars and $30K millionaires."""""""
3	I guess I just had really high expectations, so I feel like I would have usually given this four stars, but because I had built it up in my head, it's only a three. \n\nI went there for my party, and invited about 10 friends to come bowl with me. The pricing was pretty legitimate, and they still have new shoes and shiny new lanes. We went at 5pm and it was EMPTY. They said they had a big lunch rush, but I'm sure things are still picking up here. Everyone in my party got served on time and with appropriate happy hour orders, but I had my order screwed up a few times. And there were drinks that were brought out that no one had, and some of the servers (I think we had 5?) were confused. HOWEVER, I know that they're still learning, and that they're working out the kinks on their food and their service. I guess I just expected a lot more pretty early in their lifespan.\n\nThe bowling - well it was awesome. I love Lucky Strikes and will hopefully go again, but I'm waiting for their service to be worked out a bit more, and then I'll review again and go for a 4-star review!
4	"""The staff has always been super awesome to me, which i really appreciate, especially on those early mornings when i know it's just going to be a long day. When it comes to getting a straight up cup-o-joe it's delicious and hits the spot. Sometimes i get a crazy hair up my butt and order one of those silly sugary drinks, and when ever i do i wish i had just gotten a regular coffee. I don't know what it is about the \specialty\"""" drinks here that i don't like. Which is weird because other coffee places (local and chain) i usually don't have that reaction."""""""
5	Yay for FEZ, I need to visit again.  I used to go there all the time, brunch, lunch, dinner and um, happy hour :)  Love love love sitting on the patio.  Since I moved to the east valley I haven't frequented as much, but it's always a treat when I do.  \n\nMy favorites are the apricot chardonnay fusion.  I always have to have that, actually I usually go with a friend and we split a carafe (or two).  Their hummus I think is the best hummus I've ever had and I never thought I liked sweet potatoes, till I had FEZ's sweet potato fries.  Everything is pretty reasonably priced too, which is always a plus.
1	So originally I loved taking my son to Children's Campus Too..  Up until they had to move locations to 43rd Ave and Thomas.  This area is horrible and the office is disgusting and very UNCLEAN!!!  After moving to this location, I noticed that the children were always sick and the staff wouldn't stick to the sick policy.  My son was enrolled in a total of three and half months.  He was ill six different times two in which required overnight hospitalization.  He ranged from getting a cold that required antibiotics to pink eye to coming down with an infection that included at 104 degree fever.  Unfortunately, this place on Camelback and 32nd Street I would highly recommend, but since closing the doors there, and moving all of the kids to Children's Campus on Thomas, I wouldn't recommend you take your child there.
2	Sure it's a bit scuzzy, but they have a wall of freakin' Slurpee machines filled with booze.  \n\nIt's really the antithesis of everything a good cocktail should be.  And I should hate it.  But I don't.  Part of the problem comes from growing up in Miami.  \n\nThe national drink of the Florida Keys is the Rum Runner.  It's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of Miami.  But Fat Tuesday's has it.  Well, all Fat Tuesday's besides this one.  WTF.  \n\nI was surprised to see that they have a drink made with Pyrat rum.  And it was fine.  But it wasn't the Fat Tuesday's experience of my youth that I was hoping for. \n\nWhere did the Rum Runner go?\n\nWell, the bartender explained that they had to take out a few machines to make room for additional bottles of booze.  Apparently someone had the bright idea that Fat Tuesdays should actually mix cocktails besides just pour frozen boozy slushies into plastic cups.  \n\nWhoever had that idea should be fired.\n\nBoozy slushies in plastic cups is what this place is about.  And in the heat of a Tempe summer a Rum Runner would be just about perfect.  But they are gone because apparently some fool thought it would be a good idea to sell cosmos too.
1	"""If you are considering a stay at the W and you are over the age of 18, please reconsider. \n\nThe property is hip and the design is very attractive - but the actual accommodations put form over function in many ways. That, and the service - with some exception - was much too \wtf bff l8r lol\"""" for the $$$ that you pay. \n\nUpon arrival, we parked our car in the rotunda...great first impression until we were ignored by the valet service. Perhaps it's because we rolled up in Mazda 3 rather than the Jaguar or BMW that shared the space with us. Pardon our \""""hoopty\""""! Next time, you can save the \""""who the f are you\"""" glances for your buddies. \n\nAt the check in desk, we were greeted half-heartedly by a woman who was remotely helpful, if not being thorough enough in an explanation is acceptable as \""""helpful\"""". We were handed our room keys, wristbands (which I'm still not sure what purpose they serve) and an impatient ::sigh:: and we were on our merry way. The Valet finally caught up with me. Thanks! I reciprocated the same \""""f you\"""" look :). \n\nThe room set up is interesting, however, the bed is so close to the door (which must be very thin) and every little noise in the hallway is clearly heard. Including drunk 20-somethings on their way back to slumber. While I find their planned bedroom activities interesting, I'm not sure I want to hear about it...while I'm sleeping...\n\nThe bathroom set up is innovative - and again, very attractive to the eye - but even a nearly opaque glass door to serve as privacy for the toilet is a bit revealing. Who wants to see someone squat down and take a pee? Aren't their websites to satiate that interest?\n\nStarting about 10:30 PM, you can expect to hear a rave party in your room, no matter if you wanted it or not. I like Boom-Boom-Pow just like the next guy, but...I also wanted to sleep. Whatever gathering was being had in the lobby or whatever \""""hip\"""" nightclub was shaking the entire property. \n\nThe room service wasn't bad, but much overpriced for the entrees we received. At least the person that delivered the food treated my wife and I as if we were real humans...the only good interaction we had while at the W. \n\nSave all other inconveniences, the fire alarm at 11:50 PM was certainly the icing on the cake.  \n\nI've stayed at many top-notch hotels and this certainly was the worst. What makes it harder to swallow is that my wife booked this as a surprise - she felt horrible, and that is the worst amenity the hotel had to offer. \n\nI guess I'm not hip and with it anymore? Figure it out, W Hotel."""""""
4	"""I dunno about you, but we went to the library a lot when I was a kid. (Oh dear GOD, I just actually said \when I was a kid\"""". Send me my AARP card.) I loved browsing the shelves for Harry the Dog, Curious George, Richard Scarry stuff, and later on, trying to surreptiously include a Judy Blume in between other, more 'innocent' books during checkout. There was no way my mom would have let me BUY a copy of \""""Are You There God... It's Me, Margaret\"""", so the library was about the only way I'd get to read that forbidden fruit. Ah, Catholic school... \n\nYeaaaah so anyhew, now my family goes to the library every week. No joke, every week. I love being able to log into my account online from... wherever... and indulge my sudden whims by transferring a book, movie, CD, whatever piece of media, to my nearby branch and placed on loving hold in my name. My teen likes their anime selection; the little ones really like the little play area and huge selection of kids' books. Plus, they do kids' activities quite a bit. \n\nMy hubby has found really recent movie releases here, sometimes there is a wait. I think we got Order of the Phoenix about a week after the DVD came out. I was able to snag a copy of Arcade Fire's Neon Bible right when it came out, and was able to scoop up Augusten Burroughs galore shortly after Running with Scissors was released in theaters. (If you like neurotic dry humor, gotta check him out in nonfiction. I'm hooked.) \n\nThere are a ton of computers to use (never actually used one though), and the librarians are really nice. Kinda slow at times, but really really nice... and helpful. For the crap they have to put up with sometimes, gotta admire them. \n\nAll in all, it's a weekly trip we all really enjoy. The atmosphere is decent, and the bathrooms are super clean. We can pretty much get what we want, and I don't feel like I've been made to squeal like a pig, like I do when walking out of Barnes & Noble. Now if I could just get them to open a little coffee bar... :) \n\nMinus one star for needing a bigger parking lot during turista season (yeah, like that spring training parking ain't gonna end up there... it's right across from the stadium) and having a door alarm that likes my hubby way, way too much."""""""
4	In case you haven't already heard...Ernie's Inn serves authentic Maryland-style blue crabs (while in season and by special order) and crab cakes!!  If you're from the East Coast, or a seafood fan, need I say more?!\n\nI don't go to Ernie's very often, but when I do, it's for the blue crabs, the shrimp, a nice selection of cold brews, and all the Old Bay I can take!  In between huge handfuls of seafood, I also noticed there are a couple of nice-sized TVs on the walls (I hear they play the NFL games on Sundays), too.
5	"""I've been coming into Babbo regularly for a couple years (I went to the Cave Creek location before this one opened), and have always been completely satisfied.\n\nThe menu is large, with plenty of pizzas and pastas to choose from.  From the pizza menu, it's hard to choose between the traditional choices like the Sicilian or meat-a-ball, and the more interesting varieties like the chicken alfredo with spaghetti baked on top of the pizza - but I think my favorite would have to be the barbecue chicken pizza.  On the pasta side of the menu, there are a couple dozen great dishes, but the new three-cheese mac and cheese with bacon and Italian sausage may just be the best thing on the menu.\n\nService has always been great.  Everyone is friendly, and there's a casual atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.  There seems to be a lot more \regulars\"""" here than most places I go to, which says a lot about a place."""""""
4	My first experience with Casey Moore's was a team lunch this afternoon - a team of about 20 people. The restaurant was large enough to accomodate everyone and the staff was very helpful in assembling tables and chairs. Ther service was prompt and the food surprisingly quick given our size. \n\nI thought of trying the oyster po-boy that was a lunch special, but in the end I went with one of my favorites - fish and chips. I have had countless fish and chips and restaurants and bars throughout the US and UK. This was right up there near the top of the list. The breading wasn't heavy; the fish light and flakey. I found the cole slaw with the green and red cabbage and carrots was exceptionally good. It was not saucy or too rich. The flavor of the vegetables stood out with just enough sauce to provide flavor. Yum! The portion was so big that I barely touched the fries. You will most likely come away with a doggie bag from this place.\n\nI would definitely go back - maybe try some oysters or try out the bar.
4	"""Amanda at Butterfly Petals is a true floral artist and her pricing is very affordable. The bride (my daughter) and I met in person with her twice to design the two bouquets, reception centerpieces, 5 bouts, 3 wrist corsages, and the flower girl basket. My husband and son picked up the florals just before the ceremony at Amanda's home office, our order was so small and the ceremony was nearby, so it was better to pick up the flowers ourselves. \n\nThe one and only error on the order was there were supposed to be ribbons around each centerpiece vase. But we easily tied some extra ribbon around each vase at the ceremony venue. The bride loved the bouquets, the centerpieces were lovely, we were very pleased with all the florals. Amanda added eucalyptus leaves as an accent to the vases and bouquets, all looked beautiful. They truly lasted and were used on Thursday at both the ceremony and reception venues, then again on Saturday at a second informal reception at the newlyweds' home.\n\nAmanda is very creative and is a total flower nut, and I say that as a compliment. My daughter wanted a very traditional \look\"""" and was a tiny bit nervous about Amanda, since she features very unusual florals on her website. But Amanda \""""delivered\"""" with fresh and beautiful flowers in the right colors, the bouquets sized exactly right, and charming accents. Butterfly Petals gets an A minus, only because the ribbons were not on the vases as specified in the order. I would have no hesitation in recommending Butterfly Petals."""""""
5	One of our Lexus car keys/key fob was cracked and needed to be replaced. Going to the dealer would be anywhere from $250-$400! I found Alcatraz on Yelp and called Todd. Todd did exactly what he said had to be done and the charge was $75.00. Todd is knowledgeable and knows what he is doing. Most other locksmiths couldn't do the job because they don't have the machine necessary to fabricate the key. I am a home inspector in the Phoenix metro area, and before I left with my new key, I took more than a few of Todd's business cards that I plan to give to my clients, so that when they move into their new home, they can call someone who is reliable, knowledgeable and trustworthy to help with their home security.  Thanks, Yelp, as I found Alcatraz on your site.
3	11/18/10\n\nOn the day I stopped by here for what I thought would be just a cup of coffee and some down time to write a review or two, I found out that Coffee & Tea Express had experienced a burglary-- windows were smashed and a TV was ripped off the wall.  This happened in the early morning hours, and had I not overheard otherwise, I'd never have known it-- the place was disheveled just enough to show that customers read the news while they enjoyed a cup o' joe, grabbed a bite, and/or worked on their laptops.  The barista/phone operator/sweeper/cashier had his work cut out for him as he took my order for some coffee and a salmon burger (I was failing at my attempt to hold out for the OYE at the Pink House an hour later); answered my questions about the ingredients in their bread products; and jotted down a phone order for takeout, all while maintaining a clean environment.  He said I could pay for my meal at the end, when I was ready to leave.  How convenient!\n\nDid I forget to mention that the barista made my coffee from beans he'd just ground up right before my eyes?  Talk about serving a fresh cup, and all for $1.60!  The salmon burger was made w/ previously frozen Alaskan salmon fillet.  I knew this, bec. the otherwise tasty, buttery, crisped, yet flaky salmon patty, w/ crisp large-leafed lettuce and tartar sauce, on a buttery, crisped, and flaky croissant had edges that were still frozen.  If it weren't for the fact that I had an OYE to go to, where there's a promise of more food and drink (in actuality, there wasn't!), I might've felt more disappointment over this mishap, but I took cutting away the frozen bits as an opportunity to lower my calorie-intake at the coffee house!  :)\n\nFree wi-fi, good coffee, and sincerely friendly customer service make this coffee shop a winner that I wouldn't mind visiting again!
4	I love this convention center! This was the third year I was here for Phoenix Comic Con. It is clean, the staff are friendly, and the location is very convenient right off the light rail stop 3rd Street/Washington or 3rd Street/Jefferson depending on the direction you're coming from. I know people complain that if they drive in they have to pay for parking but I also know that while one nearby garage charges $12 another close by charges $6- so if you really want to save some money just drive around the block. Both those garages are a very quick walk away.
4	This was a pretty nice place to stop for lunch. Nice environment, friendly and attentive service, and pretty good food.\n\nIt's a small menu, but there are a few things that look to be worth trying. This time I went with a French dip with fries. The sandwich was good - quality meat and bread with a nice flavored dip. The plate was piled high with fries - easily twice as much as there should have been. But they were very tasty - nicely seasoned, with a little sugar and maybe a hint of cinnamon.\n\nFor a nice place with all organic food, the prices were definitely reasonable.
5	Cheers to Cost Plus!!!! I love coming here to pick up candles and little knick-knacks for our new home. If you're into fragrance candles check out Indonesian Teak, Tahitian Vanilla and China Pear-basically their whole candle line is amazing. I also pick up ALL of my coffee here since they have unique and strong flavors such as Italian Roast. Every 6 bags of coffee purchased earns you a free one. :D  Cost Plus is even my go-to place for last-minute gifts like photo frames and wine. As a rewards member (sign up for free) I occasionally get emails advertising awesome specials in-store and online. The cool thing about these coupons is I don't even have to print them out, the cashiers are happy to scan then from my cell.
4	I had to write a review about this place after my group was torn about going after reading some reviews about how dirty this place made them feel and how they were tore up from rocks. So we envisioned way dirty water that was a trickle at places with rocks in too shallow water where we would have to go done in single file. We were ready for the worst but it's really not that bad. \n\nIt was never less than 10 yards or so wide. Yes, people do loose their trash like beer cans but it's not as trash filled as other places like the beach or the park. They do throw giant marshmallows so you will encounter mushiness. And people are peeing in the river, (are you surprised?) but it's moving water, so it's like nature's toilet anyway (like the ocean). And most everyone is drunk but I know there is a lot more stupid going on in any bar on any sat or Fri night. So, basically, if you are prissy about being things being dirty, and are one of those people that can't have a little fun with other drunk people and look down on them for doing stupid things, you will not have a good time. FYI, you will also not have any fun in places like NYC or most dive bars which you will think is dirty. Most of the people are just lazing down the river with their friends. \n\nI would like to give some tips and warning: Bring water, rope to tie your rafts together, water shoes, spray on sun block, food/snacks and a DD. I have never EVER seen so many cops out on my 20 mile drive back to our place in my life. There were check points, and 3 cop cars pulling over 1 car, and people with their hands hand cuffed behind their backs. It's serious guys, don't mess with it.  Also, you will not notice how drunk you are until you stand up, so be careful not to drown.
5	Hands Down my favorite Viet restaurant in the valley, The Bun bo Hue is the best! great lemongrass layers in the broth, the pork blood is a great authentic touch, gotta have it.  I also get the pho noodles in this one, instead of the thicker vermicelli thats traditional with Bun Bo Hue, but i like the wasy the thinner noodles pick up the soup!  Also try the Beef stew with egg noodle!  WOW  my fave comfort food at this place
5	This is one of the best entertainment values in town and I look forward to its arrival every April.  If you have not yet checked out the local improv community here in Phoenix you will be surprised at all of the offerings by various groups affiliated with the Torch Theatre.  (check their website for year round performance info.)  \n\nFor the annual Phoenix Improv Festival at the Herberger Theater, they jury in the best groups from around the United States for one action packed weekend.  All you have to do is show up at the theater (well, get tickets first of course) and you'll have an opportunity to see some of the most interesting improv groups from around the USA all without spending a minute waiting for a flight out of sky harbor airport.  Get ready to stretch your perceptions of what improv is, as these groups have so many different takes on it.  Some will make you laugh, others will be wickedly irreverent or will amaze you with their talents at weaving a cohesive story line.  Still others will have you thinking about them a month or longer after seeing their performance because of all the subtle intricacies woven in.  \n\nPhoenix's veteran improv groups frequently travel to other major cities to perform and have a key role in teaching and mentoring some of the up and coming local groups participating in the festival.  What a great opportunity for all to share the stage with groups from outside AZ and interact offstage.  fantastic learning opportunities that will only make the Phoenix improv community continue to grow better and stronger and deeper. They have a fantastic vision that's come so far and deserves our continued support!
5	I was told that the Chuckbox would have the best burger I EVER had, ever.  \nI was not lied to.\nThe 1/2 pound burger I had was fantastic.  I also had onion rings and and an ice cold beer to wash it all down.\nTheir menu is not extensive, but it did not need to be.  They do one thing, and they ARE the best.  \nWell, at least the best I've ever had yet.\nIf you can recommend a better burger: please let me know.
5	2 floors of accessories!  I'm not sure who Charlie is, but he/she has definitely charmed me with his/her store!  I wish they had a Charming Charlie in Tempe.  Then again, it's probably for the best because I would end up spending all my time (and a good chunk of money) in there.  Charming Charlie is kind of like the accessory-heavy version of a Forever 21.  The main focus of the store is accessories with a few pieces of clothing vs. Forever 21.  The jewelry is all very trendy, and inexpensive, and there are also cute shoes, scarves, and hats for purchase as well.  Everything is color-coded which makes browsing easier.\n\nEDIT: They do have a Charming Charlie in Tempe Marketplace!  How will my credit card ever survive? : )
3	Yume is a nice little place for sushi and a few korean dishes.  Plenty of seating with a diner-like atmostphere.  The service was friendly and efficient.  Based on 1 dish alone I would start at a 3-star rating with definite potential to go higher to a 4.  I oNly had the chance to try the bi bim bop (rice bowl filled with veggies and a fried egg) this visit and thought they could do a few things to improve including:  using bulgogi meat instead of the ground beef, offering it 'dolsot-style' (aka in a hot clay pot) so that the bottom rice gets toasted, adding more variety of vegetables, and leaving the gojuchang ) hot pepper sauce on the side to add.  Also, the menu had a variety  of good things including the lunch bento box and sushi happy hour.
4	A beer with instructions on the label?!  This is right up my alley!\n\nGreat selection of beer, friendly service, great sandwiches!! The server was really nice and offered suggestions when I wanted to try something new. The sandwiches all sounded so delicious, I had to just go with with first one on the menu, the Sun Devil. Pretty tasty! As we were leaving, I saw the TRAY of nachos go by . . . can't wait to return and try those next time!
2	I rarely go to this Target even though it's close to my house. The reason is that it's not great. Everytime I've been there it has been really dirty. I was there 2 days ago and it was the same. I was greeted by  an overflowing trash in the front of the store. When I went inside to find a trash, it was so filthy I didn't want to press the flap to put my trash in the bin. Also bought a drink at the little snack place and the counter and fountain machines were a sticky, gross mess.
1	"""The owners are Korean, the lady was really nice.\nShe made eye contact and smiled and greeted us.\n\nThe guy... I don't think he meant to be racist,\nbut when a couple Latinos/ ppl of Hispanic decent came in the store and orders,\nhe goes \Amigo, someting wrong?\"""" \nI could not believe my ears lol.\n\nThe food... I can cook better (and I'm pretty pathetic)\n\nI ordered sukiyaki and my bf ordered bulgogi.\n\nSukiyaki was just veggies (carrots and lettuce) on top of rice. almost no meat.\nBulgogi was not well seasoned.\n\nThe food was bland and nasty.\n\nWas NOT worth the 15 bucks. Would not go back again."""""""
4	Love this place. My husband is fan of the sushi, always happy with all he chooses. He averages 90$ at dinner himself. I am a huge fan of the Giant Turkey salad that they have been famous for many many years. I also love the Shogun chicken - sauteed chicken breast with Udon noodles, not oily at all. This place is like home for us. My kids consider it their favorite stop.The tempura is crisp and flavorful- no worry of dirty over used fryer oil. I don't need to be seen at trendy places- I just want consistent meals that I have grown to love. It is perfect for girls lunch out and the bar side is fun with all the upbeat 80's music. I used to go to the bar when it was a separate establishment called Paradise Lounge. I probably have been here over 100 times. I have been in a Chef in AZ for 25 years and I know good quality ingredients when I taste them. This is the place.
5	I grew up in Texas, we had a delightfully experience eating the Whataburger and their onion rings.  Living in Vegas, there isn't anything here like it.  So when I get a chance to get one of the burgers, I go for it.  \n\nToday, even though it's morning, I want a burger and that's what I get.  They grill the bun and it makes the burger.  I avoid mustard, not on my burger!  I love mayo and ketchup, with old fashion lettuce, tomato and pickle!  \n\nThe onion rings have changed a little, but I still like that batter and the freshness of the onions. \n\nThis was a good burger and definitely brought me back home!
5	When I came to Phoenix from NJ,  one of the things that shocked me the most was the complete lack of South American and Caribbean cuisine.\nUntil now! \nI'm Colombian, so when I looked over the menu and found such familiar foods as patacones and bandeja paisa, Colombianas, and batidas de guanabana, I felt like I was home.\nDont expect fast service. There is one waiter. It really is a mom & pop run establishment. no small talk while we were there..he took our order and off he went.\nThe prices were reasonable and they had a lot of fun soda-inca cola and Colombiana which are pretty hard to find here.\nPatacones (fried plantain) were deeeeelisssshhh! Just like you can find at any latin restaurant back east.\nAll in all fantastic food, great menu items, and no nonsense service.\nTasty, and we'll be back!
4	"""It was a scorcher. Certainly one of our famous triple digit days, and as I sat in the passenger seat, bumming a ride from mi amigo, Vicente, I couldnt shake my contempt for his leather seats.\n We drove down Roosevelt in the Garfield district towards Ranch Market, on the way discussing the Alwun house, Rito's, and some colourful housing that we both agreed leant to the overall gentrification of the neighborhood.\n The grounds of this place are sprawling, palatial in fact. I was completely ripped and had on a pair of imitation wayfarers that had a broken arm and kept sliding off my face with the least possible movement of my head. \n Endeavoring not to break them further I held my head at rigid attention my back was grammar school like in posture. I then realized how arrogant and white I must've looked, in my mind I fantasized I was a conquistador with a local Toltec guide showing me the ins and outs of the Aztec village we were entering, then I kinda got sick of that phantasy and pictured myself as a balmy Harrison Ford intrepidly following Albert Molina through an alternate ruinous Mayan temple, all the while expecting danger and betrayal at every corner.\n I probably looked half insane as some of the patrons looked at me oddly, giving me a wide birth. Entering the place it's just as big inside. It's like costco and food city had a wild passionate tequila filled tryst and gave birth to the Eva Longoria of grocery stores.\n Vicente and I immediately split up, probably not the best of ideas, but I wanted to explore and he was eager to do the same. I quickly snatched up the worst shopping cart in the store (you know the one with a bad front wheel and sticky grip) and let my stomach guide me.\n Two gallons of horchata. check. Exotic mozzarella style cheese from Oaxaca and  some delicious salty Cotija. check. A lb. of plantains. check. Mango's, apples, dried pinto beans, sugar snap peas, string beans, potato's, roma tomato's- check! \n Grocery shopping while intoxicated can get a little quixotic, and confusing to say the least. I hadnt the slightest clue what I was going to make, but the colors of the produce were certainly alluring.\n Finally Vicente caught up with me and laughed gutturally upon seeing my hodge podge of a shopping cart. I stared thru him with glazed eyes as I espied the \cafeteria\"""". I abandoned my shopping cart and slowly walked over, intriguiged, literally beguiled by the aroma of cooked meats. \n I hadnt the slightest clue what most of it was, and what broken Spanish I know certainly wasnt helping with most of the dishes behind the glass, until bingo; Carnitas.\n There was a word I knew and loved, I stared at the \""""meat\"""" not quite convinced I knew what I was looking at. Sure it said carnitas, but this was...well...it resembled a tamarind bean, but was much longer, and had a color ruddy and blackish, certainly most unappealing. The tube like meat sat coiled amongst itself like tentacles in a brackish water. I stared at it hypnotized, until a young Mexican attendant came to take my order. \n \""""Hey man what you want?\"""" he asked, breaking the glamour that held me entranced.\n \""""...a half a pound of this...\"""" I said unsteadily. He looked at me almost impressed, and half cautiously. As he deflty grasped a pair of tongs and started sloshing the meat back and forth in it's brackish juices, attempting a better grip, it looked more alien to me than ever. I was beginning to come to my senses out of a stupor, and it was slowly dawning on me what this was.\n In a slightly horrified and hoarse whisper I leaned over the counter and looked him in the eyes and asked, \""""Wait, wait......what is this...stuff!?\""""\n Then he said, grinning a knowing, mocking grin, \""""Yoo don' know whad tis is and yoo wanna poun' of eet man?\"""" \n Just then Vicente strolled up casually behind me and saw what I was doing, the two exchanged a brief chuckle as apparently Vin had overheard the attendant's query.\n \""""Trrrriiipa!\"""" Vicente exclaimed, using his dormant mexican accent that usually only comes out when drunk or speaking with his parents, to which the attendant grinned and nodded enthusiatically.\n Aghast, I stepped back in revulsion, I'd nearly ordered a pound of pigs intestines.I felt profoundly embarassed, never more had I shown off the \""""pinche gringo\"""" side of my personality than in that moment. \n I ended up just ordering some pork ribs that'd been marinated in a chile sauce, along with the ubiquitous spanish rice and refried beans.\n I love ranch market, but I'm certainly not going back until the raspberry of embarassment lightens."""""""
5	I had forgotten about this place until I went to the Biltmore the other day.  It's such a fun place to go, with or without someone else and they have delicious sandwiches, salads and of course, wine!  \n\nThey have a huge wine selection, and I highly recommend getting a bottle when you're here.  As for food, I love the grilled vegetable tart, the veggie sandwich and the Mediterranean focaccia.  All are very good.\n\nTheir prices are definitely reasonable too.  It's a great place to read a book or people watch- or both!
4	This location has a great selection of everything sporting goods. I especially like the hiking and camping section which is packed with fun stuff to spend your money on. I've spent tons of money here through the years and have always had a good experience with the staff. The guys in the shoe department have been very helpful through the years and I am glad that they talked me into buying the Superfeet inserts for my shoes. This has been and will continue to be my go-to sporting goods store. Only beef is that it tends to be a lil pricey.
1	This place sucks! The owner waited on us and her frizzy nasty hair was hanging down and all over the place. I guess because she had a hat on it was ok YUCK beside that she is a terrible waitress and this is the second time she has waited on us. The prime rib was the absolute worst we have ever had, the mac and cheese was pasta with milk no flavor at all. The owners kid runs around, screams and acts like a heathen and they think its cute and thats what paying customers want to experience when they go in there. We wont be spending anymore money in that place.
3	Drink - espresso is yummy, chai is boxed & not house made - do not like.\nFood - Cupcakes are yummy! Have seen other food & it looks good.\nDecor - I love the art work, the bathroom is nice & clean, patio is lovely during cooler weather. I do not like the TV's, to me it's just a distraction - personal preference. Some of the tables are wobbly, kind of annoying.\n\nI really loved it when this place was open later and kind of round the clock. It actually made me step aside from Lux obsession to study here since it was open later.
4	I have to admit that I didn't always like The Grind.  I think it had something to do with the ATROCIOUS service we used to get from the same redhead bartender.  Listen, I know you have red hair, but you don't have to take it out on me.  I'm just here for the burger.\n\nWhat's great about The Grind, however, aside from finally hiring some decent staff, is that all of the food--not just their famous coal-fired burgers--is pretty fantastic.  The Kobe burger is, of course, excellent, but the asparagus salad with chicken is also a winner, the chicken wings are just plain delicious, and their specials are always a safe bet (save for one unfortunate--and I hate to even call it this when it was some bastardized version--French onion soup).  The Grind is a great little neighborhood spot to belly up to the bar, order a well-crafted cocktail, and enjoy a plate of coal-fired deliciousness.
3	To start not good. We are from TX and love the waffle house. When we pulled up 2 cooks were outside playing around the waitress was on her cell phone there was no customers and tables were dirty. All of the staff working appeared to be teenagers or young 20's. \n\nNow once we ordered the food was good and the waitress was on point and by this time they had a 1/4 full house. I will give them a 3star but be cautious when you first drive up.
2	"""Let me start by saying that I really struggled with only giving \Famous Dave's\"""" two stars and the struggle was created within myself for two reasons. \n\nFirst, the service was excellent.  I was eating alone for lunch and so I sat at the bar.  Despite filling drink orders for the entire restaurant, and taking food orders from patrons seated at tables located in the bar area, Ashley went above and beyond to make me feel both welcomed and satisfied.  \n\nSecondly, \""""Famous Dave's\"""" is a chain restaurant, and I believe that should be considered when reviewing a restaurant.  There is far less at stake, far less control, and there is a stronger motivation for profit margin when dealing with an entity of this size.  And here comes the conflict...  \n\n....BUT a restaurant should primarily about food--taste, texture, originality, tempered by faithfulness to the genre--in this case barbecue.  And while I agree that in a world, at least here in the Sonoran Desert well known for Sonoran Mexican cuisine it is a tall order to compete, it simultaneously makes it more important for a barbecue joint to stand out and become a gem and maybe even a staple.\n\nDave's is a decent place to go in a pinch.  And here I'll confess, I passed by the barbecue joint I planned on dining at because the line was out the door, but I knew that I could find a seat at Dave's, and so I just kept driving.  And that reminds me that I should add another factor by which one should judge an establishment--the price of the food.  I don't believe I'll be able to resolve the conflict in this short review, because of all the variables, but it can at least serve as an explanation of the rating.  And maybe I'm hoping that \""""a little sugar will help the medicine go down\"""" as well.  Cuz, I strive to be a gracious man, and it pains me to offer a negative review.  But I also strive to be a truthful man and so I'd had to give a falsly positive review.  Yet more conflict! \n\nI find that Dave's, in comparison to other barbecue joints within a gallon of gas removed, is about double the price and half as good--Rudy's at the I-10 and Chandler Blvd and Joe's just north of Elliot on Gilbert for example.  This bolsters a point I made earlier.  Because it is a bigger chain joint there is a pull to high overhead which is bound to raise prices. \n\nFor example, there are four forty inch LCD's in the bar area alone.  I didn't survey the rest of the restaurant so I can't say whether or not there is even more nitpicking I can do, but the point remains.  At one point I was asked whether or not I wished for the channel to be changed on one of the sets.  I replied, \""""I don't want to mess anyone up.\""""  The reply was whispered, \""""Oh, nobody is watching.\""""  AND they shouldn't be.  Food is about eating, talking, and talking, and then eating, and even drinking some more.  Eating is a social event, and in my opinion, the distractions and temptations we are forced to face at home and in public should be eliminated.  \n\nMany people I know forbid both political and religious discussion in the home.  So, if you can't have deep discussion in the home, where can you have them without common distractions.  You can't really have them in the car as that is a huge place of distraction--keep your eyes and your mind on the road.  But the restaurant is a different story.  That is the place to have those discussions.  They are public houses where societal pressures keep the demons of the discussion at bay.  When it comes right down to it most of us, who are not sociopaths, are bashful creatures and our passions are repressed a bit.   \n\nThe Atmosphere:  When I drove to the restaurant and parked, exited my vehicle, I took in the air through my nostrils.  There was no smell of smoke at all.  That concerned me.  I also noticed that there were no piles of wood.  For a restaurant doing that much business, barbecue business, where do they keep the wood?  As far as the inside it seemed the same, no smell of smoke, and pretty much just a TGIF or Applebee's of a different color.  Nothing that would distinguish it as BBQ but a sign and a menu.\n\nThe Food:  I was made suspicious by the atmosphere, and so when I tasted the meat maybe I was jaded, but I seemed to taste a charcoal flavor, like a briquette or chemical, propane like flavor coming through.  I imagined them throwing the meat on a grill after removing it from a tub to heat it up--it wasn't too hot to handle and seemed heated up.  \n\nI've already addressed the service and so I'll wrap it up with this:  BBQ is about smoke first, carefully applied over time, and secondly to rub and sauce.  I'm afraid that in Dave's case, his sauce has become a cover for the meat.  Frankly, I don't need anything but a plate and good meat to enjoy bbq.  I don't need tvs, a bar, or anything else.  I appreciate what Dave has done for himself, and he has done well, but I believe it has spun into something that isn't barbecue any longer.  So, for what it is worth, I have to give Dave two star"""""""
3	I wanted to like this place more....\n\nArriving early to meet a group for a birthday dinner, the husband and I sat down at the bar to soak up the atmosphere. While the hostess was a bit off the bartender was nice and attentive while we waited for our party. The drink menu is intriguing, but the 2 drinks I did have left a lot to be desired. I do not like overly sweet drinks, but both of my drinks lacked any fruit flavor which was odd considering the laundry list of ingredients in both.\n\nOnce we were able to figure out the seating situation (our party grew by one) our waitress was attentive. The menu has some interesting choices. Not being a fish lover I felt their apps were very limited- I like sweet potatoes fries but some variety would of been appreciated. I had the pork plate and enjoyed it it more than other in my party enjoyed their choices.\n\nOverall the experience was fine. I found their prices to be reasonable and I really love the space- but I was just not really blown away.
2	"""Yelp says 2 stars means \Meh. I've experienced better.\"""" You would think that's all I'd have to say in my review, right? Well, I want to explain why I've had better. Deal? Deal.\n\n*There was a rather long and slow line when I entered. Quickly, it became even longer, with 4-5 people waiting behind me. Only one lady at the counter was taking orders. Wow. On a Sunday afternoon? \n*The place was packed. No open indoor seating. It's crazy to think of one person and a laptop taking up a large table with 4 chairs. Waste of space. (Our book club needed 5 seats!)\n*The smoking outside is unbearable. \n*Only one size straw. Seriously? My small hazelnut latte looked like a freak of nature with a 15\"""" straw jutting out of the lid. \n*The aforementioned drink I bought was not that tasty. It was naturally too sweet. Go figure. I had to nurse it for fear of a sugar brain freeze. \n*Kids everywhere. College, I mean. Not really my demo. \n\nI love the idea of turning an old bank into a happenin' coffee joint. The decor is cool. I WOULD LOVE to hang here. But, I can't. It's just too packed and not very friendly (from the service to the seating options). \n\nIf I were in the 'hood and wanted a quick jolt, I MIGHT stop here. Or, as others have mentioned, I could just keep driving a short distance and stop at one of my fave spots ever, Steve's Espresso. Yeah, I think I would keep on driving. This place is, with 2 stars, simply meh. I've experienced better."""""""
1	"""I usually love Paradise Bakery but this location is the worst.  I agree with Ken B.  this is the worst location ever.  My complaint is specifically with they way the smaller counter is handled, the one that you would most likely visit in the morning for a muffin and coffee.  The staff doesn't listen to you when you order they are too busy paying attention to the \regulars\"""" and just let them interrupt you while your ordering.  Today I ordered a coffee and a muffin, right in the middle a regular walked in and started to ask about the cookie boxes.  The person helping me actually stopped helping me and was going to start answering his questions, meanwhile, I was standing there waiting for my coffee cup and had to remind her!!!!  This location just plain sucks."""""""
5	Amazing stay! Very clean rooms, most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, clean fridge and microwave in room available for you to use. Only stayed here 1 night, I wish I could extend my stay! Very affordable price, the complimentary is not just butter and toast. They had a complete breakfast with just about anything you could imagine. The staff was super nice and very knowledgeable about the area. The public transit system is about a block from the hotel. The hotel is located smack dab in the middle of all the hospital buildings and has free parking! Only down side is a funky old smell coming from the hallways (but once you step into your room its a whole different story) and the pool looked small, I did not use it though. Overall it was amazing, cant wait to go back and visit the staff and spend some more time in their clean and oh so comfy beds!
5	You know, as much as I do love Jamba Juice, I prefer Robek's choice of flavors. They taste more tropical and vibrant, if that even makes sense. I'd go to either one depending on what I'm feeling. If I want a more berry/banana flavor, then I'd go to Jamba. If I want a more guava and tangy sensation, Robeks it is. You can't go wrong with either one, but Robeks has the slight edge with the freshness and how their smoothies are made. I know I'll be a frequent customer here, especially during this summer!
5	Stopped here for some early dinner and a beer, after driving by. Really glad we did- our meal was incredible. It's not a big place, but it has a fun atmosphere, decent sized bar, and lots of patio seating, which is nice starting this time of year. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and received excellent service throughout the meal. Not a huge beer menu, but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices ($4/pint, $10/pitcher). \n\nA smaller menu with excellent choices makes me happy and that's what they offer. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus- really glad we did that. Grilled just right and drizzled with a sauce that is slightly sweet made it even better. \n\nI got the burger, my husband got the brisket sandwich and we traded halves. Both were very tasty. The actual burger itself was full flavor- my only suggestion was maybe a few less toppings. I like a burger topped with a few things, but this patty had so much flavor that I felt all the toppings almost took away from it. \n\nThe brisket sandwich was the big hit of the night. Great flavor in the meat, tender and juicy and enough slaw on top to give it a a nice tang and add texture. The buns on both sandwiches were excellent and high quality. \n\nWe had our little one with us and they have a pretty good kids menu, too. It's not listed on the actual menu- the server will rattle it off for you. Ours is a grilled cheese fiend and theirs was great- two kinds of cheese on 9 grain, served with grilled asparagus and fries. We actually asked them to substitute tomatoes for the fries, which they easily accommodated, and she plowed through the hole thing. Minus the asparagus- but that's on her, not Grassroots :)
3	First of all, I LOVE the name of this place :) \nI'll be purchasing a t-shirt, lol! \n\nI had the lemon & orange loafettes. The lemon was by far my favorite. The shop lady instructed me to heat them in the microwave before eating them & it does make a huge difference.\n\nMy daughter had a white chocolate pretzel stick, which she gobbled up & then drooled over the memory for days after. She also had a mini cupcake. She has concluded that the frosting is the best frosting she's ever had, so I'm going to go back for a cupcake next time! \n\nThe location is small, not a lot of room to lounge, but the service is very friendly.
3	The crowd here tends towards older classier types.  (Think business men or the ladies who lunch crowd).  The drink are divine but the menu tends towards the safe/traditional.  Two drinks, an appetizer and two entrees ran about $90.00  Not super economical but tasty.  My bigger complaint is about the interior, for that kind of money, I don't want to be seated at vinyl booths and be reminded of the buffet at Paris.  \nThe menu is heavy on the steaks and seafood.  Had the prime rib which was super tasty but could have been a little warmer.  The trout was delicious with teriyaki sauce.  The teriyaki sauce is the same used on the bacon-wrapped scallops which was strange as scallops usually need very little adornment.  The scallops were delicious but seemed a little pricey at 10.00 for three pieces.  Skipped dessert at my Pear Martini did the trick.  \nOverall, I might come back for HH during the week (when drinks are half off) otherwise this place is a little out of the way for my taste.  (It's in the Gainey Village Shops just outside of the Hyatt Gainey Ranch)
2	Qualification - I am rating the Healthy Marketplace side and not the coffee bar:\n\nJust left a movie and wanted to pick up something quick/easy to go - drove by Luci's the other day so I stopped there to grab some chow.  The space itself is cool and has potential.  But...\n\n1.  Many of the goods are the same as in the grocery (some stuff from regular groceries, other stuff from Sprouts/Trader Joes type places) but they cost more.  Five or six bucks for some healthy cereal.  In particular I was disappointed in the wine.  I guess its just my style, but I like a variety of affordable small-production wines.  They had small production wines, just not cheap.  And then they had the same Clois du Bois red wine that has been on sale for $8.99 in Fry's/Albertsons/Safeway for the last five years, except here it was $13.99.\n2.  Grabbed a chef salad and a meatloaf sandwich to go.  Salad looked good (and was) - big pieces of chicken and egg - but,....   No dressing!!  The meatloaf was Ok at best, the bread was probably sliced and placed in the box 8 hours ago, and it came with 2 wedges (wedges for a sandwich?) of tomato and two little tiny strings of roasted red pepper.\n\nI had high hopes based on the name/location/etc., but I was disappointed.  Maybe try some quirky grocery items and wines?
4	Went to Bomberos last night for the first time, and our group really loved the place. One of the better patios in town imo. Huge mesquite trees all over give it tons of shade and awesome mood lighting and candles in the evening make for a great night. And misters...lots and lots of misters! The patio is definitely a popular place because by 10pm the inside of the restaurant was empty but the patio was still packed!\n\nThe South American music was pumping and the couches and cozy chairs made it a relaxing evening of wine and nosh. Great selection of wines. We had the cheese board, the meat plate, and a few orders of bruchetta. They were all good but not great. (For instance, I'd much rather have a meat and cheese selection from Kazimierz or bruchetta from Postinos) But that was ok because the atmosphere made up for it.\n\nAnd the dessert, oh my the dessert. They had two and we ordered both. A bread pudding which was probably the best I've ever had, and an orange creme brule which was SOOOOO smooth. Mmmm. I love orange in desserts and it definitely didn't disappoint. Ordered a mocha to go with it and and it was big and tasty. (It could have been a little warmer though)\n\nOverall, great place. Good but not great food, great desserts, great atmosphere, great for medium sized groups of friends who want to have a night out to catch up with each other's lives.
4	"""We've been trying to get here for several years and never make reservations in time or want to go on a Sunday when they are closed. We finally went for the full dinner menu at the bar.  I like the interaction with the bartender and having a glimpse in to the kitchen.  The food was creative and complicated, but comfortable.  Although, I thought there were times when they tried to hard to keep the food approachable- i.e. a taster plate of a trio of sandwiches, which followed a palate cleansing taste, that just didn't seem to fit in the overall experience.  \n\nI could have used a cheat sheet as I was eating to remember what all the ingredients were- like when you get a wine flight so you don't forget what you are drinking! \n\nThe Pastry Chef had a Circle K styrofoam cooler on the back of her station- again not sure if it was a statement in \approachability\"""" or just a small miss on attention to detail?  But given the crisp presentation of everything else in the restaurant, I found it out of place.\n\nThe scallops were my standout- delicious!  And a taster plate of what I think was called \""""Glacier Lettuce\"""" that the server described as a succulent grown in New River that I loved!  Overall, a great experience and great food!"""""""
2	Aside from the girl behind the counter being rude to us.. then our sliders not having cheese on them as ordered and paid for... it was a delight to watch the owner berate her in front of us when we brought the sliders back in and asked for the cheese we paid for! However, once we got the sliders back to my friends house we were both very disappointed that the sliders were completely unseasoned and lacked that delicious salty slider taste that were accustomed too. \n\nI also order a loaded Chicago Dog which I ate almost immediately, soggy wet mess, yes made by the same girl.. you know, it only takes one bad employee to ruin an experience forever. Will probably not return as I made a special trip to check this place out after so many favorable reviews. \n\nI'm still so very disappointed, love sliders.
5	"""This place totally makes up for the other pizza place that unfortunately shares the same name as this place, but has absolutely no affiliation (thank goodness).\n\nFirst off, I have to say that the two times I've been here, I haven't once paid for the actual pizza, because if you sign up your birthday, you're given a coupon by e-mail for a FREE PIZZA.  Extra toppings are extra charge, of course.  So  if you haven't tried this place yet and don't know whether you should spend your money, sign up to get a coupon on your birthday.\n\nI'll definitely spend my money for a pizza even without a coupon.\n\nThe crust is thin and crispy, with just enough chew to it so it doesn't taste like a cracker with toppings.  The coal firing gives a wonderfully smokey flavor to the pizza, and leaves yummy bubbles in the crust.\n\nSo far we've done half pepperoni and half meatball.  Meatball you say?  I admit I've never had meatball on a pizza, so I couldn't help but picture golfball sized meatballs atop a thin slice harnessed in place with strings of mozzarella.\n\nI know, I know..they Slice the meatballs, silly.\n\nI'm normally not a big fan of pepperoni, but this stuff was surprizingly meaty, slightly spicey, and not too oily.  The meatballs though...the meatballs are my favorite.  \n\nTop everything off with great service (people that actually know their stuff), a fully stocked bar (with beer sporting the name of \the Kilt Lifter\""""), and nice cozy atmosphere.\n\nI have been back, and I will be back."""""""
5	I went to a foot Dr. in Tempe.  He wrote me a prescription that was to be filled at a Apothecary shop.  My boyfriend had been to this one before so we came here. Lots of parking in the lot . It is sort of hidden in a building full of Doctor offices.   They do take insurance,but since it is a natural product it cost more, than a pill type script would. But, of course well worth it because,it is all natural. they sell a lot of really cool things here in this store as well as getting scripts done here. If you are looking to going down a more natural path in your life with your food and what you drink as well/ Then, give this place a try.
1	"""I had been a customer at this store for a few months and was pleased with them until recently.  I had called and put a rocker and ottoman on hold on a Friday afternoon letting the person I spoke to knwo that I would be in to get it on Saturday.  I even asked if I needed to provide my credit card information and was told \no, I will put it down under your name and we will see you tomorrow to get it.\""""  When I arrived to pick it up on Saturday it was being loaded into the back of another customer's truck. \n\nI approached the woman behind the counter and told her I had called to put it on hold the day before - she stared at me like a deer in headlights and said \""""I am so sorry, we actually sold it earlier this morning.\""""  The chair clearly had just been sold minutes before I arrived as it was still in the parking lot.\n\nThe thing that upset me most was that the cashier simply stood there and said sorry - she did not offer a solution, she did not say anything else, she just stood there.  Needless to say I will not be shopping at the store any longer - it saddens me that the customer service could be so poor and that the store does not keep their word to their customers."""""""

2	A couple words can easily describe my review on Malee's: oily food, cold & incorrect orders and a cockroach. \n\nI first found Malee's Thai Bistro through Groupon.com when they ran their $20 for $40 coupon. My fiance and I are frequent Thai eaters so I thought I would be a good opportunity to get some great food at a discount. Boy was I wrong. \n\nFirst thing you should know is that Malee's is not traditional Thai food. It's Thai with a twist and, in this case, not a good twist. We started with the Spring Rolls. Usually Thai spring rolls are tightly wrapped and not overly fried. These were neither. The rolls were messy and the cooking oil was dripping out of them. \n\nMy fiance and I ordered the Thai Basil Pasta no spice and Coco Chile Fish medium spice for the main course. The Thai Basil Pasta came out lukewarm and spicy. The Coco Chile Fish was oily and not spicy. Although both dishes were somewhat tasty, they simply didn't hit the mark. \n\nTo top it all off, we noticed a cockroach scurrying across the floor as we ate our dinner. Needless to say, we decided to pass on dessert and head home. \n\nDo yourself a favor and try other local Thai restaurants. Thai Basil and Lemon Grass Cafe in Tempe blow Malee's out of the water.
3	Va Bene.. ahhh.. well I used to live close to here.. so if we wanted to go have wines, apps or a late dinner.. AND watch the 40+ crowd get their groove on.. this is where we would go.. bc I could walk and have some entertainment... Hey man.. sometimes it doesnt take much! \nI do like the bar...its nice with alot of good wines on the list... The bartenders have always been super sweet.. \nNOT loving much on the menu.. but I travel alot and will say my fav Italian is in the east coast.. (if not Italy itself:-) ) .. \nBut to counter the effects of a bit of wine.. Id recommend the bruschetta... patio..? Well it faces a parking lot.. but again.. some good stuff to watch going down out there.. like I said, cheap entertainment.. Ive more of a choice now that Ive moved:-)
3	Mido Sushi has a $20 all you can eat Sushi Buffet.   It includes tempura or gyoza, sashimi plate and other appetizers.  The options for the Sushi selection is quite wide.  \n\nThe first thing that was obvious is that the tempura/gyoza, sashimi offering is quite large.  It's a full plate of tempura with 5 or 6 vegtables and two shrimp.  The gyoza had five pieces.  The sashimi plate had 5 or 6 different fish with 5 or 6 slices each.  \n\nHowever, the taste and quality of the food was just so so.  The tempura was soggy rather than crispy.  The gyoza was oily.  The sashimi plate didn't have a lot of flavor.  I ordered Unagi, Albacore and the Mido roll.  All were ok, but not must haves.  \n\nThe service was excellent and everyone was friendly.   Although I had left over food, there wasn't a charge.  Great place if you are on a budget and starving, however if you want quality sushi and willing to pay for it, I would look elsewhere.
4	Last night was amazing at this delicious steak house. I strongly advise anyone that wants good steak to come here for the prime rib. Definitely once a year type place because of how expensive it is. Which is why i reduced the star level. Service was definitely good enough. The first lady that approached us at our table wasn't a stellar server but the bus boy or whatever he was was amazing. Letting us know about the steaks wines and potatoes and such. calamari was pretty good too.  The bread and butter were amazing as well. I was very surprised that my prime rib was a lot better then  my Bf's filet Mignon(which tasted a little too salty for my  taste and I had been drinking a little bit since it was my birthday and my BF bought me a bottle of champagne, so that takes a lot for me to say that). I did not necessarily care for my bf's scalloped potatoes that are kind of deep fried with caramelized onions and peppercorn gravy.  The garlic mashed were a million times better with the steaks.\n\nMy BF's twin brother ordered the chicken for $25 and said it was no where near as good as the steaks we had all ordered except him so which is why when you go to a steak house you must order a steak. BE PREPARED, They are no where near cheap. The cheapest thing you can order is a glass of beer on tap.  Next to that are the appetizers then chicken then assuming the seared ahi but I had come for the steak! might as well since it was my birthday when we went.  The creme brulee was good but I'm glad we didn't have to pay for it because it definitely was not as amazing as some other I've tasted. I am extremely glad our service wasn't terrible or didn't get any living parasites in  my foods because I cannot tell you how upset I would be not to have a manager that cared about that kind of stuff.  I find it so hard to believe that a manager could possibly act that way as if they didn't care about quality service at what people pay there. That kind of worries me for the next time I would like to dine there again.  I guess its a chance of luck or risk but if their steak was as amazing as it was last night I would not mind taking that chance again.
4	I am a long time Vietnamese food fan... this place is right across the street from my office, so I hit it up for lunch pretty regularly. \n\nI've had the beef and chicken pho, and the bun (noodle bowl thingy), not tried the sandwich yet, but I will.\n\nThe soup broth is great. The noodles are tasty. \n\nThe beef soup is my favorite - it contains the yummy viet style meatballs, rare beef, and brisket. Only complaint is that it should come with more herbs, but this is Scottsdale... not Da Vang or Maxim on the Wessyde. \n\nThe spring rolls are pretty good. I've had better, but I order them sometimes, anyway. A Viet spring roll is wrapped in rice paper, with noodles, pork, shrimp, and herbs inside. Not deep fried. Yum. Eat with peanut sauce, and some chile sauce or sriracha.\n\nThe bun (noodle bowl) is really good, too!\n\nIt's clean, the service is fast, and the food is tasty and healthy, unlike most everything else in that shopping center. \n\nTo the person who said they never saw a Vietnamese sandwich before... fail. :( It's a wonderful result of the sad history of French colonialism in Vietnam, and these days, typical Viet fare. I love them at Da Vang, and will have to try one at Tea Light some time soon. Expect an update when I do! But... the pho is so good, I don't usually stray from it. \n\nDown side: With a belly full of noodles, I want to take a nap.
5	"""What a super great place to eat! We went here after a visit to D.B.G. and we were starving. Luckily, we only had about a 20 minutes wait for a table. This place was packed. We got a great table on the patio. I loved the outdoor patio, plus those huge over head heaters kept us toast warm. Our server Heather was very perky and fun and friendly. We had food envy, checking out other people's tables to check out their food. Everything looked \huge\"""" and yummy! \n\nWe had the Big Rig Pasta and the Pasta Basta. The Big Rig was super yummy rigatoni covered with the best tomato-chipotle cream sauce. I loved it so much!!! Basta was penne, feta cheese, kalamata olives, pine nuts, and sun-dried tomatoes. These yummy dishes were both less than $9 and enough to eat for a couple days. B. J. really wanted to try the lasagna, but they warn you right on the menu that they take extra time and we couldn't wait! \n\nFor dessert, we couldn't pass up on trying a pizza cookie. We picked the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. It was SO good.  Who doesn't like a freshly baked hot, hot cookie topped with ice cream?  Oh, yum! \n\nThe food here is very delicious and the atmosphere is very fun. I love Oregano's!"""""""
5	Being 40 weeks pregnant and miserable I decided to pamper myself and my mother so we went in for the 60 minute reflexology foot massages. I've never had a massage that soley focuses on the feet. The only foot massages I've had were the wimpy ones you get during a spa pedicure or the few minutes that are spent on the feet during a full body massage. This foot massage was amazing! After we had been seated in a semi-private room in super comfortable reclining chairs, our head, neck and shoulders were massaged while our feet soaked in warm water. Once we were all nice and relaxed our feet were given the much needed attention they deserved. I even fell asleep for a little bit I was so relaxed. It was a great experience and at only $30 for the 60 minutes it's so inexpensive. There's no reason not to give your feet a treat. I'm so glad my feet found this place.
5	If you're looking for great tacos, tortas and burritos just like the kind you'd find on the streets of Mexico then this is the place.  \n\nThe torta de asada is my favorite.  A Torta is a sandwich made with the meat of your choice.....beans, pickled jalapenos, cheese, tomato, lettuce and buttered bread.  The burritos are also yummy.  In the burrito you get meat, onion and cilantro, the beans and rice come on the side......and the red salsa is so good.\n\nI normally go there for lunch but I'm sure the food is great at any time of the day.
4	New(er) to town, we had to take a chance on picking a chinese place on a lazy saturday night.  we got the number and menu from the phone book, and yelped it in our usual style to see that it was good news.  \n\nwe got crab wontons, chicken chow mein, pu pu platters, and sesame chicken.  wantons and chow mein - A + - really good and impressive for to-go Chinese.  the pu pu platter was good, but surprisingly small.  the sesame chicken was just odd, delicious, but odd - with the runny funny sauce being put on the side - this with no explanation from the hostess chick.  no fortune cookies - wtf mate? - had to ask for soy sauce with an order of white rice to get two little packets (sad).  but littler things, in comparison to the well portioned, fresh tasting, yummy as heck Chinese places I've had in a while, does not compare.\n\nI'd only mention to watch out for the front hostess/pick up girl - she just seemed overwhelmed and lacked focus; after watching her mess up one order, deliver the guy's who'd order had been messed up the last, mix up two different parties and question our phone number 3 times - we were sure to check our food and ask 3 more times for extra soy sauce.  \n\nSum it - good Chinese food for a good price (15-25 per person) not too far away, and really good as leftovers!!!
4	A quaint, no frills Greek dive with good food. Tucked away in a nondescript strip mall, I would never have found this place on my own if a friend of mine hadn't taken me one day. The lunch menu is diverse with plenty of choices, ranging from veggie to chicken to beef dishes. I've tried many of them and always felt satisfied. The hummus is tasty.\n\nAlso, this isn't a fast food joint. It's a casual and friendly sit-down restaurant with waiter service.
2	I have to admit that the Chai from here is incredible. Great tasting and comes close to trumping Cave Creek Coffee Company's version of a great summer drink. However, charging over $5 for a SMALL blended Chai with soy milk borders on outrageous when similar drinks at Coffee Plantation, The Coffee Bean price a lot less. \n\nAs well, I've found the service lacking. From questions about the varieties of coffee they serve to asking my drink be made a certain way always seem to elicit an unfriendly response. i.e. I'm putting him out by asking the question/request
1	this place was terrible, I have a black truck and first of all they had one guy drying all of the cars and my car came out and was fully dry by the time the kid got to it to dry it off. They need to really rethink the amount of employees they need out their each day of the week. There was ONE guy standing there writing tickets for cars and it took at least ten minutes before I could even get out of my car and tell him the wash I wanted etc. And also while I was waiting for him to dry off my truck, I went in to the fat guy sitting at the desk and politely asked him why it was so backed up and why they had so FEW employees working, and he was as careless as ever, he just wanted to shoo me off and get back to what he was doing just sitting there at the register when he could of been out helping! STAY clear of this place, A good local car wash that is near there is the one on Indian School and hayden its a great place.
2	Good Idea, Poorly Executed\n\nby bbqBOB2010\n             I've been going to Lucille's since it opened 3 years ago and it seems to be going further and further downhill year after year. At the beginning, the food was always outstanding and the service was great.    There would always be multiple servers coming around and helping us out. Nowadays, we go in wondering if we will leave happy or disappointed... it's usually the latter. The service is usually pretty good but lately they seem to be too busy and unhappy.\nThe only good experience we've had in the past few visits was a manager named Dan. He was amazing! Always fixing any problems (and there's always at least one) and helping us leave somewhat happy. Other managers just walk right past us or seem to be put-off by having to talk to customers! It's unreal.\nMy wife and I have decided to never eat there again after this last experience. Everything from when we walked in the door until when we left was horrible. The hostess seemed stressed out and confused, the server was too busy, and the food (that took forever) was cold and tough. The only time we actually saw a manager, there were three standing in the doorway to the kitchen laughing and yelling about something on one of their cell phones. It was ridiculous! Immature and unprofessional.\nNext time we are craving BBQ, we will be at Famous Daves!
3	This is a good place in my neighbourhood to pick up some fast food when I don't have the energy to cook (pretty much always).  It's a small place, with authentic mexican items on the menu like tongue and other animal parts that most Americans are not used to.  I have to say that while the staff was really nice, once I revealed that I also speak Spanish (my looks are deceiving), they were extra nice to me.  Their fish burrito is huge and the tacos are small, and super tasty, just like in Mexico.  It's a bit hot in the place, I don't think they have A/C, but it's nice in the winter and spring, and you can sit outside also at a couple of picnic tables.
3	I've been scoping this place out for a while now. But it usually always comes down to that I make a killer chili dog at home that no one could mess with and besides why would I pay someone for something I could do myself. Well, I finally gave in and gave Maui Dog a try based on some of the yelps. \n\nThe location used to be a cheese steak joint and isn't the sleekest building on the block but who are we kidding, we only come for the food right? I ordered a Hana dog volcanic style (hotter mayo sauce), a spam slider Maui style (sweet with pineapples and stuff), and a side order of fries. The meal came out to over 10 bucks with a tip. \n\nThe slider had a quarter inch thick slice of spam, which, I haven't had in about 15 years. The spam was on a sweet roll with a bunch of the toppings listed. It was good but not great. I am not a fan of sweet stuff to begin with but then it just kind of fell flat. I would recommend not getting it Maui style. Maybe it would be better if it was spicy. Or if they would sear the spam and give it a slight burnt/rcrisp coat it could be much better. \n\nThe Hana dog was masterfully created. Absolutely delicious. Nice big dog, buried in bacon, avocado, pico, cilantro, on a sweet bun and the volcanic sauce was money. I will most definitely attempt to recreate this beast at home. \n\nThe fries were very weak. They were soggy and filled with oil. The kind that your mom would attempt to make at home instead of the fast food version you wanted. I would suggest making them crispier and adding some seasoning. \n\nThe man at the counter was as friendly as they come. He even came out and was checking everyone and how they were doing. He recommended adding some ghost powder to make the Hana dog even hotter. I may take him up on that. \n\nThe bill was a bit much for the product. It came out to over 10 bucks with a tip. For a gourmet hot dog, a slider, and potato a 10 spot is a little excessive. However, with that being said, the dog was delicious and the guy at the counter provided excellent service so I would consider going back on that alone. At this point I recommend skipping the fries and slider altogether and sticking to the dogs.

5	I have been a faithful client of Stephanie Willis for over 6 years now. She has brought my sun damaged, hormone ravaged skin back from what I thought was a hopeless place. \n\nAfter spending most of my teenage years in the sun lathered in tanning oil I thought I had defied the odds and ended up fairly fresh face with very little sun damage. Then I hit my 30s and I had 2 pregnancies back to back and WOW everything I had done in my teens and 20s surfaced with a vengeance. Hyper pigmentation, hypo pigmentation, wrinkles, freckles... you name it, I had it. Before I met Stephanie I had tried everything including expensive treatments, serums 2 different estheticians and a dermatologist who told me to invest in some good camouflaging makeup. I was so self conscious I didn't EVER leave the house without heavy makeup. After I started seeing Stephanie I began seeing incredible improvement. I'm not saying it happened overnight but gradually my skin tone has evened out and my face has  become more youthful and firm. I have even been complimented on how it glows!  I wish there was a way to post pictures on yelp but If you want to see for yourself message me and I will email them directly to you. \n\nI can't say enough about what a difference she has made in my life.
2	Overall good food. Prices decent. Moderate to bad service. Took more than 30 min to get one pizza. Only three other tables after the Saturday lunch crowd.\n\nServers forgetful! not good in the least about special requests. We had three easy ones, none were met.\n\nHostess is one of the worst customer service people I've ever encountered. She barely speaks or acknowledges the customer, sometimes doesn't speak at all.\n\nNo wi-fi, no email on website. Really catchup to modern times.\n\nUndecided if we will return.. We were in a rush today, disappointed that we were waiting so long, getting concerned about time.\n\nToo bad owners don't have email, would have written them directly before this review.
4	The last thing (and only) thing I bought at this location was shampoo (and it was a great deal, about 70% off).  Unlike its Chandler twin, this location focuses more on higher-end couture items.  This is great and deals are definitely present, however, I miss the ability to snag a pair of shoes for  under $30.  The store is often busy and it's difficult to search the over-stuffed racks.  I'm totally a fan though-- I live a mile away and find it easier to pop into this store than the Nordy's in Fashion Square.  Here's a tip:  go here when you are in a patient mood with time to blow.  There's lots to look/dig through here!
4	We brought Grandpa here to celebrate his 92nd birthday. I was a wee bit concerned taking him out on V-day weekend because you know how they are about crowds and loud spaces. I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nNormally the environment in which I'm stuffing my face doesn't even register. If I'm shoveling in the highest quality lobster money can buy I really don't care if I'm doing it in an abandoned warehouse or in a marble and 14k gold Disney palace. However, I did notice the cute and rustic vibe at this place right away. First of all, it's not right in the middle of Old Town (it's kind of off to the side) so parking was an absolute dream come true. HUGE bonus. The front area was a lovely garden/patio dining area where I would have loved to eaten. Alas -- the family's not much for al fresco so in we went. The space was tiny but warm and pleasant. We ate at a back table that offered the perfect amount of room for our party of 10. The music evoked images of sad, drunken, smoking French clowns but it was unobtrusive enough. \n\nService was very attentive. Nobody was sat near us until the place began to fill, water was refilled promptly and the staff was very friendly. \n\nFoooooddddd....the steak tartar was amazing. Mussels were cooked to perfection. French onion soup was the gold standard. The foie gras was good but not the best presentation I've had. It was served on a piece of brioche with raspberry coulis. It came across as a burned piece of toast with jam and a piece of foie gras plopped on top. Duck was good but the risotto was AMAZING. The steak was great as were the fries that it came with. The salmon looked overcooked and my brother was not a fan of the blueberry sauce that it was served with. \n\nOverall great experience and I'd love to return for brunch on the patio!
4	We love Babbo's.  We've been going since they've opened.  We usually get a salad, bread, and an entree to share.  We get out under $20 most times (depending on the entree).  This place is cheaper and way better than Olive Garden.  Service has always been excellent.  Out of the 100 times we've been there only had a problem once and they handled it very professionally-and it was no big deal.  If you want average Italian fare at a good price with nice people this is your place.  They do take out too which is nice when you are too tired to eat in.  They also have a nice patio to dine on when weather permits.
4	Finally made it out last night. Place has a lot of hype and has been on our list for a while now. Atmosphere was great, lots of red, lots of latin hipsterness.\n\nOur party started off with a pitcher of the White Kiwi Sangria, the Guacamus, and the lettuce wraps. I'm not as big a fan of white sangria as red, and I thought it was good but not great. I've definitely had better. The lettuce wraps were 180 degrees from what I was expecting. (the standard pf chang's type deal) They were basically a fruit and nut compote on a thin crunchy leaf of lettuce. Really really good with the sangria. I'm also not a big fan of guacamole but the guacamus (guac and hummus spread) was pretty good, and my guac loving companions thought it was amazing. Definitely a must try.\n\nFor dinner we had a pitcher of the Passion Fruit Sangria, and my wife and I split the Grilled Peach Salad w/ chicken and the Pork Torta. Both were excellent, the Torta especially. It came with huge crosscut fries and coleslaw. The flavors of the sandwich were excellent and I was bummed to have to share half of it. The sangria was pretty good but with all the hype about it being the best sangria ever, I didn't think it was quite to that level. But still, yum.\n\nOur service was a bit slow but our waiter was super friendly and the 3 women in my party all thought he was ridiculously hot. Later in the evening he spent some time chatting with us at the table, and told us that the bar side of the restaurant is a lot of fun later at night when the restaurant side clears out. He did however forget to bring us the extra pita chips we asked for to finish off our Guacamus, which made me a sad panda. The prices for the food were pretty standard, although I thought the $26 for a pitcher of Sangria was a little steep.\n\nI wish I could give Ticoz 3.5 stars because it really is better than your standard 3 star but not really quite up to the 4 star level that most of my favorites are. But that being said, it has a lot going for it and it's definitely worth trying because the entrees really were amazing and the menu was full of things I'd love to try. Also the weekend breakfast with $2 mimosas sounds pretty darn good to me. Will definitely be back for that :)
3	In April I went to Dicks to buy some Golf Clubs, they were busy as usual in the golf dept but I understood and waited around to get some golf shoes. I search and search for shoes but could not find my size and was never offered any service, the two clerks had finished with their customers and were doing pricing on various displays and they never looked at me to see if I was finding everything ok. I had to approach them for help and they seemed upset that I took them away from their duties at the time. I usually get good service from Dicks but not that day, I needed up spending over $500 on shoes and clubs that had to be custom fitted. What is most frustrating is I also went on their website to rate the service as they asked me to and I mentioned the customer service wasn't very attentive to me and was never contacted by a District Manager or Rep, seems like they didn't care
4	"""If I ever have the urge to spend more money on bedding than the current value of my house, this is the place to do it.  I actually learned of The Linen Tree when they were listed as a retailer of Molton Brown bath products on another website.  My first impression was not the best, however.\n\nWhen I could not find a product on their website, I asked via on-line chat which was supposedly \open.\""""  No one answered.  No worries, I emailed instead.  Again, I never received a response.  At that point I decided if they could not respond to a shampoo inquiry, I would never buy my next set of $777 bath towels here either.  And so I purchased the shampoo from Saks.  And for all you haters that now think I can only use the finest shampoo, it was not for me.  It was for my husband.  And any time a man is interested in any product related to hygiene, I recommend you ladies support him...no matter the cost.  The opposite extreme is far more costly.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks and I need drawer sachets as a gift.  So I did the unthinkable and went back to TLT when I struck out elsewhere.  And I am now in love with that store!  Kind of luck my husband.   Didn't care for him at first, but he grew on me.  In a good way, not like a tumor.  Anywho, what I found at TLT was a beautiful selection of all things bed and bath...linens, lovely soaps and bath products, accessories, and my drawer sachets.  There's also a nice selection of china, table linens and pretty decorative items.  As for the staff, they were very polite and helpful.  I'm only knocking a star for the rocky start.\n\nTLT will definitely be on my list for gift items.  Maybe I'll even treat myself occasionally, too!"""""""
2	Took a star off for pricing, the decor is nice  but it seems that in order to confiscate for the high priced interior design they had to up the sushi prices.\n\nLet's start with the calamari. It's a little more chewy and it's battered in tempura batter and served with a dipping sauce, which consisted of soy sauce and vinegar. Overall very good.\n\nThe roll itself in the bento box consisted of deep fried shrimp and imitation crab meat then covered in tempura batter bits. Overall good.\n\nThe short ribs in the bento box started off good, but where there weren't bones it was super dry and chewy. \n\nThe box also came with what looked and tasted like a round slice of potato, which was deep fried. Kind of mushy, this I didn't like. Maybe just a filler?\n\nThe tempura part of the bento box only came with one shrimp then a couple carrots and one broccoli and some sweet potato slices. The carrot was a bit undercooked along with the sweet potato.\n\nThe side salad on both the bento and the Katsu curry chicken was a vinigary light dressing with wasabi mixed into it. I didn't like this , because I don't like the taste of wasabi. Lol they should have at least a house dressing then a special dressing.\n\nThe Katsu curry was a bit dry and overcooked. \n\nOverall I wish they'd give you a side of rice with the bento,maybe since most customers aren't Asian?\n\nDoesn't make sense. All I know is this isn't truly authentic Japanese food. Coming from Korean descent and having a Japanese step dad. \n\nThe special rolls is what will take the most $. Prices ranging $10.95 and up. For just a few pieces of sushi, basically one roll. They just look fancy but all they consist of are the fake salmon egg, maybe spicy mayo sauce and green onions to jazz \nIt up. Took one star off for pricing and not so good quality.
5	Seven days a week, this bar is ready to be your destination.  The friendly and smart staff is ready to make you feel at home, find a drink that works for your budget and palette, and are polite enough to make it known that this neighborhood hangout is NOT a sports bar or dive.\n\nThe Lost Leaf was already my favorite bar to chat with a bartender.  When I was a single. lonely guy trying to establish my role in Downtown Phoenix, The Lost Leaf was the best place to get a nightcap, where I could talk to experienced and seasoned musicians, artists, and foodies.  Every person that works there is more than what meets the eye.\n\nThe Lost Leaf already had the best beer selection in The Valley, but they recently added a small draft selection, including the delicious locally brewed Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout.  \n\nLet's say you go to a party and you are talking to someone that is about to leave because their ex showed up.  Invite them for a nightcap at Lost Leaf.  You are at the poetry slam at Lawn Gnome and homegirl's poem rocked your socks off and you want to talk about the importance of  diversifying potato varieties in America's diet.  Tell her to meet you at The Leaf.  You went on a blind date and it went really well, and he smells so good, and his smile is so white, but you find out he doesn't drink, but you don't want to be only one drinking... buy him a soda at The Lost Leaf.  \n\nI have gone to the Leaf with sober friends, alcoholic partygoers, my girlfriend and my mother and everyone of them has had a good time.
5	This is the Pita Jungle closest to me, so I go to this location above all others. This place had me at the cool vibe when you walk in the door. LOVE the artwork as well. I like going there for dinner, the low lighting is nice. Hell, I'd go there any time of the day really.\n\nI usually try something new every time I go. I'm not a fan of hummus, which I know is blasphemy to someone who loves that places like this.. yadda yadda whatever. \n\nI love the woodfire pizzas, the pita crisps, and the spanokapita!! Be warned, I dont think their pizzas are meant for only 1 person. Every time I order it I end up taking half home with me.\n\nIts a nice, laid back place to eat inexpensively and healthy!
5	"""I'll admit I was a just a bit nervous from some of the other yelps, and maybe our experience was a strike of lightning, but wow, my trip to Lon's was one of my best dinning experiences ever.\n\nWe made reservations for 6:30 on a Friday Evening and requested a table outside on the patio (Thanks to the great yelp advice) which was essential, you have to be on the patio when the weather allows.  So there we were seated, looking out of the quintessential south western landscape and off to the peak in the distance as the sun set across it.\n\nThe service was spectacular.  Almost too frequent of \check up.\""""  You're not rushed at all because they aren't turning the tables on the balcony, the last seating is at 6:45.  The food was delicious, we had seared ahi tuna that tasted just right, and split an entree of a sea bass special.  Perfectly cooked.  We finished with a dense chocolate cake.\n\nBut we weren't really finished, not with the sun having seat and the fire place casting a glow.  We paid the check and spotted two great seats next to a fire pit.  The weather was perfect for it, just a slight chill in the air while we enjoyed some cool white wine.\n\nI could see this place as a creating a super great romantic evening, as we did, but also coming for drinks with friends enjoying the night air, or in the winter, the inside is divided much like a lounge.\n\nGreat Vibe, great time... Lon's got it!"""""""
4	The best fast-food style pan-asian cuisine in town. But the quality is really fresh. Everything is fried/cooked made to order so you do have to wait but dishes are piping hot!!\n\nYou order at the front and they give you a number that you take to your table. Most dishes for lunch average around $8.00\n\nMy favorite dish is the Mongolian dish (options of beef, chicken, shrimp or tofu). \n\nThey have a new soda pop machine that is really HIGH-tech! The orange-citrus tea isn't so great. But they have fortune cookies in the middle of the condiments corner that aren't stale!!
3	I took my dad here on Friday night for his birthday. it's new in our neighborhood and we decided to give it a try. We started out with the bruschetta and pepperoni rolitos. The bruschetta was pretty tasty- proscuitto, black olives, melted mozzarella, with a balsamic drizzle. The only thing that would have made this bruschetta so much better would have been fresh tomatos instead of the side of warm marinara..which I thought was strange. The rolitos came with the same side of marinara and were pretty good, but you had to use the marinara or they were super dry. Ok, here's where they lost a star... before we got there, both of us looked at the menu online to have an idea of what we would get and since it was dad's birthday, he wanted a nice, special pasta dish. Welp, once we arrived, we notice the menu online was not the current menu. After we ask what the deal is, the server informs us that now, they are down to just pizza, paninis, 2 pasta dishes, and a few appetizers. My dad was hungry and did not want to go somewhere else so we just split 2 small pizzas. The pizza was TOTALLY different from the pictures online. A completely different crust and look. It was pretty good, but not out of the world. They charge an extra 1.98 a pizza for fresh mozzarella, which I thought was weird, but ok. To top things off, service was crap. I told the girl it was dad's bday and she still instantly brought the check after we got our pizzas. I had an empty water glass for about 10 minutes before I flagged her down and asked for a refil...she took the glass and never came back with it. Apparently, we weren't ordering dessert because the bill was on the table. She kept looking at the table so I am assuming she was trying to get out of there. She would have made at least an extra $10 on the bill by waiting to see if we wanted dessert. The only other strange thing is they were playing loud hard rock music... strange for an Italian joint. If I remember right, I think Disturbed was playing...which is def not something dad wants to listen to while eating pizza.
4	What a beautiful property! The grounds are really extensive, with many little hidden spots to sit and read a book, or even just watch the rabbits and quail wandering about. This is a great hotel to catch some R&R and just enjoy the springtime Scottsdale weather in classic Southwest architectural surroundings.\n\nAfter being driven to our building, we entered our room, which consisted of a bedroom and sitting area; big walk-in closet; and huge bathroom with his-and-her sinks, separate tub and shower, and enclosed toilet. After relaxing on the patio for a bit, we explored the property. The pond was beautiful, and we even saw children fishing for crappie with poles and tackle provided by the hotel. Among the many pools on the property, there was even one geared toward children with a pretty impressive waterslide.\n\nWe wandered through the lobby, stopping to check out Bourbon Steak, the Michael Mina restaurant. Next we walked past the fire pits and lounge seating of the outdoor Stone Rose bar, owned by Rande Gerber (yes, Mr. Cindy Crawford). As we got closer to our room, we also saw the Willow Stream Spa (gorgeous), newly reopened La Hacienda restaurant, and tennis courts.\n\nLater in our stay, we took advantage of some of the perks of the Fairmont President's Club so we could enjoy the courts. Neither the boyfriend nor I had brought athletic wear, but that wasn't a problem thanks to FPC. For $10 we were able to order Adidas workout wear and have it delivered to our room to keep for the duration of our stay. I received capris, a sleeveless top, a lightweight jacket, tennis shoes, and socks. He got shorts, a long-sleeved t-shirt, tennis shoes, and socks. Thanks to FPC, we also got racquets for free and only had to pay the court fee. There are at least seven courts, and one even features stadium seating if you want to pretend that you're Andy Roddick or Venus Williams and get your friends and family to cheer you on.\n\nService at the Princess was very friendly and welcoming. The minor low points we experienced had to do with our room being cleaned very late in the day when we wanted to be able to change and relax before heading out to dinner. Also, the pods for our in-room espresso maker were replaced with only decaf! I know--what a nightmare! ;) But it did cause us to get dressed and go in search of a coffee bar on property. There isn't one, but when I explained to the hostess at the casual bistro that we just wanted some coffee to take back to the room, she brought two cups out promptly and said they were on the house when I tried to pay for them.\n\nI would love to come back here for a longer stay, especially since I didn't have time to enjoy any of the many pools, even though the main one is open 24 hours a day. Nor did I get to do any shopping or take a spa treatment (more FPC discounts). I can see why this is an Abu J.-approved hotel.\n\n4.75 stars!
2	"""Wow. \nNever thought the day would come when I would review a Golden Corral. \nHowever this past glorious Sunday my WT family, when told they could pick ANYWHERE they wanted to go for lunch, no need to worry about the tab, they picked the GC. \n\nThis was my first experience with this place. I've only done buffets in Vegas. \n\nCurrently my doctor has me on a strict Vegan diet, so I already knew I was in for it with selection food wise. \n\nI was excited to see the spinach and green beans, and then disappointed when I saw they were loaded with ham or bacon. Wah wah. \n\nI had some very water logged Brussels sprouts. Some steamed carrots. Pears and beets that for sure came out of a can. Some french fries and a wheat roll. \n\nWhen Our waitress sat us, I asked her if any of the rolls were vegan. I got a blank stare and then the \I don't know what you are talking about\"""" response. I explained to her what vegan was, she then pointed to the bakery area and told me I would have to flag down one of the bakers if I wanted to know what was in the rolls. So I did, and the baker was very friendly and pointed out to options I could have. Score! \n\nOur waitress was really very friendly and came by the table often. \n\nThis was for sure not a place for me. Its all institutional food, boiled and over cooked beyond belief."""""""
5	Is it possible for anyone to NOT like this place? It's kinda like Disneyland for an outdoorsman... or in my case and outdoorswoman. Um, the gun room was like a wet dream. There's also a really nice discount section upstairs where I got some things I didn't know I needed. Actually, this place is full of stuff I didn't know I needed. I bought some hiking boots and the shoe department offers a little rough terrain ramp type thing you can try out shoes on, it's kind of a joke because it's so small but I tried it out anyway. They also have the largest selection of outdoor clothing for women that I've come across in the valley. I think special outdoor clothing is ridiculous because brands like Patagonia, Columbia and North Face are so over priced and you're going to be wearing them to get dirty anyway, why would you waste the money. That being said, I still love to browse through and see if there's anything I can't live without.
2	"""Went here last night for our first night in Scottsdale for our anniversary. We like to go to places that you can tell are not chains. This was definitely a special place. Very kitschy and a little dated but has personality. We found out our waiter was also part owner (father/son partnership). He was a delight. Loved his sense of humor. One of our favorite parts of this restaurant.  He recommended a few great meal options. We started with the calamari sauteed with tomato and garlic. The sauce was so tasty but very spicy. Our mouths were burning but we kept digging in soaking up our bread in the great fresh flavors. My husband got the spaghetti bolignese and I got the ravioli trio (lobster, butternut squash and cheese) with three different sauces. I though the butternut ravioli would have been best with the sage butter and the lobster with the cream. Although didnt taste a \lobster\"""" and the sage butter had a slightly strange taste. Both meals were good. We have our favorite Italian we are comparing it to so it only got a three as the flavors were tasty but not something we'd crave to have again. We maybe given it 4 stars also if each dish wasn't $21. We felt it was a bit pricy."""""""
1	"""Holy crap - what a disaster.  I can only pray that the ones on the east coast are better than this.  If this really is Obama's favorite place, I might have to reconsider my support of him.  I don't even know where to begin.\n\nLet me just make a list of WTF items:\nWicked loud music with no theme or genre\nA bin of peanuts that people manhandle while in line\nPeanut shells on the floor\n\regular\"""" burgers have two patties\n\""""little\"""" burgers that are $5\n\nJust a disaster.  Go to Smashburger, please.  You'll love it.  This place, however, is a joke.  Also, if you have a peanut allergy, I REALLY wouldn't recommend going in here."""""""
5	Amazing job Lindsey, Yelp & Tanzy \n\nThis was one of the best events for this year, the moment my plus 1 and I walked in we were greeted with a flute of champagne and when we were seated, the wine was free flowing,\n\nOur server Jill was amazing, answered all our questions, offered great wine pairings to go with our food, made sure our water/soda cup was never empty, very personable and you can tell she enjoyed her job, told us when we come back (which we will) to ask for her and she will be our server, I am all for that! \n\nMy +1 and I were little late but when we got there, the appetizers where already out on the table, we got to indulge in calamari, house made mozzarella, beef capriccio which by the way was OMG DELISH!!! I am so sure I could have eaten the entire plate! An antipasto plate and this too die for crispy brussel sprouts, who would have thought, they were just so perfect! I also tried some of the best scallops I have had this year, they just melted in your mouth, and they were so good. And had some cedar plank salmon with couscous There e also was a sweet corn risotto and delish Bolognese going around., also had the braised beef short ribs, that just fell apart with a touch of the fork, so tender and the Filet Mignon with fingerling potatoes and grilled asparagus, that filet melted like butter in your mouth, very very nice!  And let's not forget the Red Velvet bread pudding, it was perfect! Not too sweet not too bland, very moist and just right for a cold night! \n\nAlong with the free flowing wine, Tanzy offered us a sample of a Christmas drink they had, maybe it was just for the night, not sure, but it was a mixture of pina colada & mint mojito, very delish, it was smooth and tasty! \n\nThis event also had a white elephant gift exchange, which is extremely fun and funny,  walked away with a beautiful picture frame! \n\nAlso need to say thank you to IPic for the movie passes, you can count on us being there soon!\n\n\nYelp, Lindsey, Tanzy again thank you for a wonderful evening!
5	I'm a fan! Self-serve frozen yogurt, rotating selection of flavors, and friendly workers--nice! All their flavors are great, but I keep going back to the vanilla (?) tart with blackberry toppings (lately they've had raspberries, but I hope they bring back the blackberries). The staff is friendly and they keep the place clean. I don't know how they put up with some customers who try to make a meal out of the sample cups and walk out--but I have to say the workers are always courteous and professional.  I wish I could find out where they buy those green chairs so I can get a pair!  This is definitely my favorite frozen yogurt spot!
2	"""We went for lunch on a Friday. I really want to like this place because it is so close to my home. It has a decent atmosphere and I found the staff perfectly pleasant. I have no complaints with the personnel.\n\nUnfortunately, my rating is as is because of the food. The food is the key to a good restaurant so it's going to drive my rating.\n\nI had the \Black Angus Burger\"""" which ultimately amounted to two beef patties with cheese on a bun. It was sort of like meatloaf between buns. I admit I left the onions off but I guess I didn't read the menu carefully enough - that's all it was. No lettuce, no tomatoes, nothing else except some pickles attached to the top with a toothpick. It was just a hunk of meat with cheese. I have to say it was a bit gross.\n\nMy companion had the \""""Chicken Salad Wrap\"""" which also turned out to be surprisingly simple. Basically some chicken salad scooped into a soft bread rolled into a wrap. Nothing special.\n\nBoth entrees came with fries that neither of us found particularly good.\n\nWe were both disappointed but we are going to give it another try. Maybe we just ordered two of their less than stellar menu items. However, a burger is pretty basic.\n\nSo... I can't say don't go but at this point, the food just doesn't hold up. Again, no problems with the atmosphere or staff."""""""
5	Over the years, I've had REALLY bad experiences with large air conditioning companies in the Valley. They put in damaged parts, tried to install cheaper parts than the ones I paid for, took smoke breaks on my roof and the list goes on; so I was desperately seeking a smaller company with a knowledgeable staff,;I think I found that with Absolute Air Technologies.\n\nMike Tucker came to my house today and after a brief discussion about my AC, he went right to work. He combed out all the dents in my unit that I'd been living with since last fall's hailstorm and then did an annual service.\n\nThe cost was reasonable and Mike has 27 years experience fixing & installing systems, so for once I feel like things were done right.\n\nI'm very satisfied I finally found a good, honest air conditioning company.\nYAH!
5	So I am moving to D.C. in couple weeks so I had a bucket list of all of these types of food to have out or/and make at home. One of them was to have authentic Mexican food that you cannot get anywhere, particularly D.C. So we did a lot of research because all of the places we used to go to when I was a kid are either out of business or just not good anymore. We saw that this place had great reviews and people have recommended to us that we try this place out. \n\nWe came here on a Friday night around 6:40. We only had to wait 10 minutes which is awesome. We decided to get a margarita and couple beers while we waited. The minute we got our drinks, our table was ready. My mom said she wanted a glass for her beer since she had a lime in her bottle, but it took them 10 minutes to get her a glass for the beer. It still did not kill my rating of this place because the meal itself made up for it. Even though there was a long delay like 35 minutes from the kitchen from when we had the most delicious cheese crisp to our dinner. We savored every bite of our meal. The tamales, especially the green corn tamale was outstanding, beef tacos were out of the world, chicken enchilada was hot and steamy, beans were full of flavor and reminded me of my old childhood days.\n\nThe only con from this was the service and the bathroom. The bathroom strangely was really messy in terms of toilet paper and paper towels all over so I'd recommend that getting cleaned more often so people dont walk out with things on the bottom of their feet!
1	Overpriced for the quality. This shop is expert at staging. We bought a vintage sofa and the upholstery nails were popping out by the parking lot.  The 'vintage' piece has new wood.  The upholstery buttons on another chair pop out if they snag on your clothes. Spent 50 percent more than I could have at a furniture liquidator because I thought these were unique and lasting pieces.  They are crap glossed over to sell at high prices. If it's going to fall apart on a year I could have saved a load of money and gotten furniture that I expected to last a year.
4	If you have kids - this is the place to take them!  I work in teh media and was invited for a special tour of the place and WOW is it cool!  There are tons of activities for the kids and they learn while having fun, doesn't get much better than that!\n\nOnly reason I can come off my 5 star is that it's only for kids 8 and under (even though they say 12 and under) and the fact that birthday parties are expensive.  Daily admission is $9 (I think) but I looked into having my nieces birthday there and it was $400 - for a one year old - yikes!\n\nEven though I don't have kids, I highly recommend this place if you do!
4	Just found this place and was very happy! I was looking for a place that provided threading for my eyebrows and have found it. I had grown my brows out to get a new shape that fit my face and Tori did a great job at a great price. It was pretty painless, quick, and my brows look great! After waxing, my brows would be red for a day or two and this resolved that problem ... no redness :)  Give Tori a try!
3	"""Underwhelmed.  Confusing layout.  Where do you start and where do you pay?  Why aren't there plates accessible next to the hot food items?  Do we have a server who comes to refill our drinks or do we get them ourselves?  The cashier said a server would get them.  When a server never presented themselves to us, we got them ourselves.  Fucking send somebody around to clear our plates once in a while because if I have to ask for someone to do this then I'm not dropping a tip.  Here's your tip, \Be attentive.\""""\n\nTwo adults, three kids, three drinks = $43 bucks.  That's not bad.  It's like eight bucks and some change per person.  \n\nThe salad bar is basically what you're paying for.  Good, fresh ingredients.  The 'Greek' dressing was really good.  A ton of variety.  The hot food,...eh.  Nothing outstanding.  All the bread, even the freshly stocked items, seemed stale and bland.\n\nI'll probably come again but maybe only for lunch."""""""
2	First off, I'll say that it seems like everytime I eat here I'm a little disappointed. It's like I have a craving for it, but it doesn't deliver. I honestly think it's overpriced and not as good as PF Chang's - for a few bucks more I would much rather eat at Chang's...better atmosphere, better food. At any rate we do go here once and awhile since the 44th & Indian school location is by my house. Plus having 2 little ones, it's much easier to do take-out than a sit down restaurant. My husband & I both usually get the teriyaki chicken bowl and ask them to add extra veggies. We also like the crab wontons, but the lettuce wraps are nowhere near as good as Chang's.
4	When my friend & I went to visit Phoenix in January 2011 we did a day tour of the Grand Canyon with Southwest Tours. I wasn't sure what to expect since there weren't many reviews for them on the internet but they looked good enough through the few things I read and now I'm really glad I went with them!\n\nLee was our driver/tour guide & he was chock full of knowledge on just about everything! He talked to us during the entire drive from the moment we got into the van, which in itself was very roomy & comfortable. He shared facts about each town we passed, little tidbits you probably won't find in tour guidebooks, and told us all about the different animals, plants & cactus we saw while on the road. \n\nThe group we were with was a small group of 5 people so it had a really nice, cozy feeling. Lee was very accomodating whenever we needed to make an emergency bathroom stop, which happened somewhat frequently with all the complimentary water they gave us! Haha. We made many stops along the southern rim of Grand Canyon & we were taken down on a few trails that were away from where most of the visitors usually congregate & with spectacular views so we got a chance to enjoy the beauty of nature in a peaceful environment.\n\nI highly recommend Southwest Tours & would definitely consider using them again the next time we go out there for a visit.
4	Went to the Tilted Kilt on Sunday morning to watch the NFL games.  Free parking was available on the surrounding streets.  There were also several parking garages within a block of the restaurant.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of the building at 2 East Jefferson.  Look for the escalator.\n\nWe arrived at kickoff, and there were plenty of tables in the main dining area and seats at the bar.  I was with a group of friends from the Bay Area, so we found the Raiders-Texans game and got a table.  The breakfast menu is limited to four choices.  We chose the Tilted Kilt Breakfast: three eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, toast.  Our food came out within five minutes of ordering.  It was pretty good.\n\nThere are plenty of TVs all over the restaurant, so it is easy to find your game.  The Tilted Kilt girls were friendly, and looked great in the mini plaid skirts.\n\nThe Raiders beat the Texans in a close game!!  After the game most of our group left, so there were only three of us remaining.  We noticed three open seats at the bar.  We closed our tab, and moved to the bar for the afternoon games.  I enjoyed sitting at the bar more than the dining area.  The bar has five TVs side by side so you can watch five games at once.  If you play fantasy football, being at the bar is the perfect spot.\n\nFor the afternoon games, we ordered Irish Nachos, the cheesesteak salad, the bbq bacon cheeseburger, and beer.  The salad and burger were good, but we were disappointed in the nachos.\n\nThe food is above average.  The beer is cold.  The girls are pretty, and there are plenty of TVs.  We had a blast watching our games!  If I'm ever in Phoenix during an NFL weekend, I will return to the Tilted Kilt.
5	I really, really like this little pharmacy!!! Why go to Walgreens when you can go to a local business, get better service and most likely even pay less than the chains?? [I normally pay way less for my regular generic prescription here than at Walgreens, where I used to get it filled---]\n\nI got turned on to Genrich's through a specialist whose satellite office is in the same complex--which is about the only way you'll know about this little gem of a drug store, because dig this, fellow Yelpers: the city of Phoenix WON'T LET THEM PUT A SIGN UP ON THE STREET!!! Like, what's up with that? Especially since there's already a sign up for the Virginia Court Medical Building that has room for Steve to put up a modest little sign??? I declare, sometimes I believe that the city really needs to revisit its small biz policies!!\n\nThat said--if you need prescriptions filled fast, with no hassle, and want to support an actual small business in the city of Phoenix, go to 333 E. Virginia, park your vehicle, and walk inside the gate. You won't be sorry!\n\nADDED TODAY: Don't forget to tell Steve Genrich that you heard about his great little pharmacy on Yelp!!!
4	I still recognize that this is a chain steak house.  But when compared to others (Outback comes to mind) it amazes me that there aren't more of them (BAS)  or more to the point that the chain has not done well over the years.\n\nFirst, I've figured out where a lot of these culinary school grads go when they can't get a job elsewhere.\n\nAs a result of actual culinary school trained chefs/cooks showing up at places like BSA the quality of food is quite good.\n\nHad the fried zucchini with their cucumber ranch (or whatever they call it).  Very good.  The zucchini is lightly breaded and fried.  Is not greasy at all and the cucumber ranch is reallllyyyy good.\n\nNext up, wedge salad.  As always, one salad is enough for two to share, so don't waste one of your two sides getting another salad if you go the wedge route.\n\nOrdered the grilled corn and asparagus.  Both fresh and very good.  Some complaint/observation as before on the asparagus.  The cooks don't always do the best job of trimming off the ends.  I'm not going to get into how to do it properly, but if you want to know how it should be done, you can google it.\n\nFinally, on to the dead animal.  I had the new york strip  I thought it was pretty good.  The wife had the prime rib .  Good again.\n\nValue wise their dead on...especially if you have a coupon.  Quality wise their pretty doggone good and that's comparing it to just about anyone and they're certainly better than their peer competitors.
4	I went to BJs for the first time for a dinner with some old co-workers.  I read the reviews before I went so I had an idea of some of the areas where I might have problems.  I am happy to say that my experience was a good  one.  It was a Sunday evening so that might have helped since it was not very crowded.  The weather was nice so our group of 5 sat on the  patio.  The service we received was very good.  He was attentive and funny.  Also was helpful deciding what to order from the enormous menu.  I had their Pumpkin Ale.  It was decent.  I liked it better than Blue Moon's Pumpkin Ale since I could actually taste hints of spices.  I will definitely try other varieties of their own brews when I return.  Two of the other girls in my group went for the root beer.  I tasted it and it was good but I'm not enough of an expert to say it was any different than A&W in a can.  The other two had mixed drinks and found them to be a bit pricey - $9 for a frozen mixed drink?  The table started with chips and salsa.  Nothing special there at all.  I would pass on that in the future.  I ended up having the steak salad and it was very good.  I liked the touch of the roasted potatoes.   All in all a good visit but the food is on the high side so I can't see myself going there often.  If they had a reverse happy hour like Gordon Biersch I could see myself going more, but due to the price I will save trips here for special treats or during their happy hour in the day.
4	Excellent pizza and risotto..great chocolate cake..friendly servers, reasonable prices...fresh ingredients, good atmosphere.  This is my favorite pizza place in phx right now.  Their wine is not so great, drinks are faaarrrr too expensive for anything not well.  If you don't plan on drinking much, you'll be very happy with this place, if you plan on having a few, the outcome will be much diff on your wallet and the value is lost. \n\nThey'll get a fifth star when they don't charge $18 for a double vodka drink using stoli. (hey it was my birthday!). Have yet to go for lunch..maybe a good intro to the place.
5	Filet, Sirloin, and Ribeye, oh my!\n\nThis was my first Fogo De Chao experience, and it exceeded my expectations!  I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses in the past, but Fogo was fabulous!  Sure, I could've made a meal on the sensational thirty item salad bar on it's own, but I took a breather and then went for the meat.  Green light on!  I also enjoyed the crispy hot polenta and caramelized banana side dishes. Yum!\n\nRolando was the waiter I had the most contact with and he was remarkable.  Evan, the GM, was friendly as well... this was such a treat to be a part of, and of course, even more fun because I was surrounded by some of my favorite yelpers!\n\nThanks Fogo folks - once I digest my 2 - 3 lbs of meat, I'll be back to see you again!
4	Dig the theaters...dig the movies....always clean and employees are always nice!\n\nCons:\n1. Can't kick out the snow birds that don't reazile that they DO NOT OWN THE THEATER durring the matinae. \n2. Can't kick out the older folks that don't realize that they are not whispering!\n3. Have to complain a million times to get the brats that are texting and playing throughout the movie.\n4. Can't kick out the loud candy eaters\n5. Can't punch the dumb paretn that brings thier 10 year old to a rated R movie and then tries to explain SEX to them durring the movie!\n6. Can't punch the dumb parents who let thier kids play all over the theater\n\nI don't think it's right that I should have to pay a million dollars for greasy popcorn, cold pretzles, and 4 gummy worms! \n\nOther than that....I LOVE these theaters!
5	"""You know food is good when Richard Z says the following: \n\n\That was so good. I think I need to take a couple minutes to just suck on my tongue.\""""\n\nThank you, Sir Richard Z for showing me the light. I would have never tried this place on my own but holy good god was it a taste experience. \n\nI could give or take the weed theme but the food is just ridiculous. \n\nI think the sandwich I ordered was called the Griefo... although that could be off by a few letters. But the combination of savory goodnesses made my heart melt. \n\nI'm a huge Eegees fan. I think their subs are the cat's meow. I also think Uncle Sams has one of those, \""""don't you dare fix it if it ain't broke\"""" recipes going on. But Cheba Hut gives those puppies a run for their money. It was sooooooo good. So good. \n\nI love you, Cheba, you dirty little slut."""""""
5	"""Organic Raw Unpasteurized Milk!  \n\nThere are many health benefits to drinking organic raw as opposed to pasteurized homogenized milk.   \nIs it dangerous to drink raw milk?  Pasteurization is advent technology to promulgate the shelf life of any dairy products.  It kills all enzymes and probiotics.  Okay, you can Google the rest...\n\nI take the kids on our biweekly trip to pick up a gallon of fresh milk.  They love to see the cows feeding on organic alfalfa hay.  They laugh and cheer at a little gangly calf just barely walking towards its mother.  A real sight to see how healthy and clean the heifers are.  Organically fed, hormone free and antibiotic free cow manures degrade so much faster in comparison to conventionally raised ones.  They are also more \green\"""" since there are no synthetic by-products nor chemicals that can leech into our soil and aquifers.\n\nThe milk is so fresh it comes right out of the teats, into the gallon jugs, onto the conveyor belt, then refrigerated.   I might have missed a couple of processes there, but it's darn close.  Naturally, this is where our food should come from, raised, grown and produced by our neighborhood farmers.  It's fun to get to know the actual people that feed you.   \n\nBest of all, you can see the cream floating right at the top.  My hubby and little cutie pie love the first cold glass of milk--it tastes like melted vanilla ice cream without the sugar, they tell me.  \n\nQueen Creek is a far drive for most, but I believe they deliver to other stores near you."""""""
3	"""Would give 3.5 stars if i could...\n\nI come to PHX on business a few times a year and have been trying to find a regular hotel to stay at. \n\nThe good:  nice big room, pretty location, very clean, polite staff, feels like a 4-star hotel & service except for:\n\nThe OK:  Bed is good, not great; pillows felt kind of odd, location is rather remote\n\nNeeds improvement: Free TV channels should be way easier to locate and navigate, shower head was covered in hard water deposits\n\nReally pissed me off:  The ludicrous $16 per night \facilities fee\"""" which they add on top of your nightly fee.  I don't know if this treat is saved for priceline people or not, but as a matter of principle it's ridiculous and I'm complaining to their manager about it."""""""
4	We frequent this place because we can walk there. The servers always remember my kids, this place is kid friendly. They remember us too when we leave the kids home and go to the bar (I know, parent of the year). The wings are good, my kids love the mozzarella sticks and pizza. They have karaoke some nights. They have a magic guy some nights. It's They have TV's for the sports.  Good enough for me. I can always find Brenden there!  Hey Brenden, your wife is lookin' for ya.
4	"""Pho Ao Sen really took me by surprise while on a trip to the East Valley, I decided I would use Yelp to help me find the best Vietnamese restaurant in an area that is known for having so many. I was skeptical since so many people are uneducated on the cuisine, the restaurant's website did not list many dishes that I enjoy, and there was much english spoken on the menu. Even their Bun Bo Hue required a special order of pig blood, and there was no mention of pate or ham hock. I chalked it up to an American place to get Pho, which is to Vietnamese as Spaghetti is to Italian. I mean, most American's eat it because it is \safe\"""" and their brains are comfortable with it. \n\nWhatever, I tried it anyway. This place blew my mind! I ended up ordering a \""""safe\"""" dish because that is all they had on the menu and it really wowed me. Bun Bi Cha Gio, which is something that I actually eat quite frequently was so high in quality and so different from what I am used to. The pork tasted so well seasoned and was very interesting, bean sprouts were amazingly fresh and plentiful, cucumbers and lettuce were crisp and delightful. Overall, the bowl was as if someone had hand picked the veggies and taken them directly from the garden to the bowl. The nuoc mam was a little disappointing after seeing the amazing quality of everything else, it was still very nice but not as flavorful as I prefer. When I make my own I use a Thai Chili in each batch, so I'm just used to a little spicier. \n\nSomething here that is not so typical of a Vietnamese restaurant is the relative fanciness of it. They have done a nice job of making this a warm and inviting enviroment without it resulting in crazy high prices, such as you'll find at Cyclo. I was thrilled with the service, as it was the first time in ANY Vietnamese restaurant that I received a refill on my water without asking for it, and I've eaten Vietnamese for a LONG time. \n\nOverall, I can't give Pho Ao Sen five stars because the menu does not have all the great dishes that is indicative of the cuisine and favors to the safe bets for Americans. I understand their target audience and who lives in the neighborhood, but I wish they would not sell themselves short and stay true to their roots. I will absolutely return whenever I am in the East Valley, as I loved the experience."""""""
4	Tried this spot today for brunch...really good menu selection for both brunch and lunch, and it seems they have a decent happy hour too. I had the whole wheat pancakes with the acorn squash hash. It was great and a huge portion. My dining partner had french toast with fruit which she enjoyed. The service was great despite it being packed, and prices were reasonable. My only slightly negative comment is I'm not a fan of the cucumber slices in water. Because I don't like drinking cucumber. But that's pretty minor. I'd definitely come back here :-)
5	Given my previous experience with jewelers (see my other reviews for the engagement ring story...) I was little conflicted when I needed to have a small diamond replaced in my wedding band. \n\nHowever, Farrar was a completely different experience. Despite the fact that they are selling very high end merchandise, Rod and his staff are very down to earth. I felt like Rod had as much concern for my $70 repair as he would for a $7000 custom design.\n\nWhile I was there for the wedding ring repair, I asked him he if could identify the large stone in a ring my grandmother had given me, and take a look at some nice pearls I was thinking of having reset. The ring turned out to be a lab ruby, but he was as knowledgable and interested in that as he was in the pearls. He was all around very pleasant, professional, and knowledgeable.\n\nI felt at ease when I left the store without my wedding ring, and was very pleased with the result when I picked it up a few days later.
5	I suggested to the man that we go out to WCG as I had been there once before.  Shane made a reservation for 9:00 pm which was convenient as we are late eaters from time to time.  We were greeted and seated very quickly.  The atmosphere is very dark and intimate, very nice for any couple or date.  Our waitress greeted us with a smile and was very knowledgeable of the menu.\n\nI have to say that this place serves one of the BEST Pork Tenderloins I have ever eaten.  The meat is so tender you could cut it with a fork and it came with a very complimentary apricot glaze and mashed potatoes.  Shane had a stake and a few mohitos and I had a pomegranate martini both were equally fantastic.\n\nIn all we both had our entrees, an appetizer, desert, and 4 drinks for under $100.00.
2	"""I was setup for disappointment on account of the false advertisements. I actually read reviews before I went here. They are way off. The ads said there were thousands of petroglyphs here, even suggesting to come at 10AM when the sun shines on the glyphs and to bring your own binoculars. On top of that, the website said that there is a butterfly exhibit in Feb. that was part of the \tour\"""". Sounds awesome, right? And I'm a pretty good photographer too. \n\nSo I get here. The visitor's center is nice and informative. However, the price is a little steep for what you get. I walk through the back gate and enter the trail. It's a flat, pebbled trail, only a 1/4 mile long. There is no \""""tour guide\"""", nor a \""""tour\"""". There was no butterfly exhibit. I'm there at exactly 10AM and there are not thousands of petroglyphs. Even with the binocs, they are hard to find and faded. For just $6 parking, you can see way more glyphs at South Mountain Park on the Kiwanis Trail.\n\nThe most exciting part about this tour was that a large squirrel approached us (see attached photos) and was really, really curious about us. You reach the end of the trail and that's when you figure out that you've been duped. If it wasn't government run, it would have been shut down a long time ago."""""""
4	Have been going to Pappaduex's off and on for awhile now.  Seems like I go through spurts where I wind up there several times in a row then not going back for what seems like a year.  That said, this chain is consistently good.  The service is always good, some times better than others but never bad.  \nIt is hard to find good creole and/or cajun food here and while this may not be considered authentic, it is good.  The alligator is lip smackin' good.\nThe atmosphere is somewhat lacking as the acoustics make conversation almost impossible.  Not a good place for a romantic meal, but a good place to have fun with friends.
4	"""Ok, not five stars because of the whole defend your place in \line\"""" kind of thing...but otherwise, this place is fantastic.  If only they would just do a list.  A simple list would prevent so much anxiety.\n\nActually, the high level of anxiety probably drives up their drink sales, so it might not be a bad business move.\n\nEither way, as with most places, if you know what you're getting yourself into, then just plan for it and have a good time.  The pizza is really freaking good, and what's even better is that it reheats super well.  Just pop it in the oven the next day and bada-boom, bada-bing - lunch!\n\nOh, one more thing - if you can't decide which pizza you want, you can get a half and half!  Who could ask for more?!"""""""
3	"""Well, my good friend from Boston arrives tomorrow for the long wknd.  I just got back from a wk and 1/2 vacay and scrambled to find a laundry mat to do an emergency load of bedding for my guest.  \n\nApparently, everyone in Surprise has an industry size W/D for bed linen b/c there are very few laundry mats near me.  So off I go, after work to the launderia.  \n\nI've spent more than my fair share of time at laundry mats and until tonight, I have never seen so many rules posted:\n\n\No blankets, comforters, or sheets\"""" read one sign on the washers that were a size up from the regular washers.\n\n\""""Don't you dare think about throwing your rubber backed rugs in any of the washers\"""" was another.\n\nMy personal favorite read \""""Check all machines before use.  Mgmt not responsible for damage caused b/c you were too lazy to check for a pen in the dryer.\""""  Ok, so maybe I exaggerated a bit but seriously, this place could give the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld a run for its money.\n\nAfter ensuring I didn't anger the laundrymat gods, I safely departed with my fresh smelling linens.\n\nWould I return?  You bet.  It was as clean as any public laundry facility can be, they had at least 4 sizes of washers to choose from, prices were reasonable and they had a gleaming white arcade system with Galaga.  Nice throwback to the Atari days.  However, I'd stay away from the 25 cent vending machines.  The mixed nuts look like they been in there since Atari premiered...."""""""
5	Best bagels outside of Chicago - Hands down.  For the longest time, my family and I thought Chompie's was our only option for bagels...dry, hard bagels...until we found DJ's Bagel Cafe right around the corner from their house.  I have never eaten breakfast there, but their bagels will keep us going back every week.  With a Baker's Dozen of bagels on sale every Friday, I know when I come to visit my parents from Tucson that I will always have some quality bagels to take back with me.  Great service, great bagels!!!  HIGHLY recommend!!!
4	Do you like acrylic floor lamps? I certainly do, and sidebar has two of them against one of the exposed brick walls in this new casual-trendy-cool upstairs bar on one of my favorite corners in Phoenix.\n\nI went back tonight after having a smashing time there for my birthday party last month, and again I was not disappointed. They carry Blue Moon and serve it properly (with an orange slice) so I'm happy. From what I remember of my first visit (it is a bit hazy) they had a decent selection of beers. I vaguely recall being delivered what I think to be a Chimay Red.\n\nAlas, back to the review. I has a nice, clean decor without looking like somebody emptied an IKEA truck to furnish the place. It is a mixed crowd that skews younger and gayer, but lots of different styles are represented. It is cozy, so it can fill up fast, although I haven't seen it get too full for comfort. \n\nGreat staff, great vibe
4	Yasu. It's been on my list for a while now and I finally got a chance to go. We selected a Saturday night without reservations and hoped for the best. We arrived and immediately were seated on the benches at the sushi bar at our request. The decor was very pretty and clean, I liked the folded and tied napkin, and the smooth black river rock. It had no purpose but to be pleasant and calming. We quickly forgot we were in a strip mall in AZ.\nThe server greeted us immediately and we just as quickly disappointed him when we chose not to select any fine alcohols, but he was polite and began a description of the foods available this evening. I knew I was going to have a hard time picking from the decadent options, but since I needed to coordinate tastes with my husband, we began gently selecting, eliminating, and balancing all the options. \nHere is what we ended up choosing:\n\nKampachi (baby yellowtail) Sushi \nBlue Fin Toro Sushi \nThese two selections were divine and buttery.  I looked sadly at our empty plate when they were both gone. One taste of each, but it was our first visit, I didn't know better. My regret is not selecting the Sashimi option. Next time I am getting Sashimi for sure.\n\nMiso Soup with Clam. We needed to try the home made Miso. Wherever you go it's one good indicator of quality and while it was good, we should have chosen one bowl to share instead of a bowl each. We enjoyed it, but in the future we won't waste a selection spot on the Miso, much less two spots. That was silly of us.\n\nGrilled Diver Scallops with Uni Cream Sauce. We looked for the bacon wrapped scallops, but they weren't an option. I loved the meaty well prepared scallops and enjoyed pouring the Uni cream all over. The presentation was pretty, but it was only a nibble of asparagus. As asparagus is relatively cheap, they could offer a bit more than one stalk quartered into a tiny Lincoln log pile. Maybe three stalks fanned with grill flavor? Still the presentation reminded me to eat slow and savor my bites. Easily the tastiest dish.\n\nSauteed Mirugai with Assorted Mushrooms.  I enjoyed the shredded red threads that garnished the pile of earthy blended clam and mushrooms, but my husband did not like that texture. There wasn't anything wrong flavor wise with the dish, it was pleasant for me, but not a wow.  In this spot we might have been more pleased with an item from the grill or something with tempura.\n\nAs our server got pulled away to the benched people next to us, we took his advice when it was time to order more things and spoke directly to Taki and Yasu, who happened to be right in from of us. We did come here for sushi, so we ordered: Spicy Tuna, Phoenix Roll and Yasu roll. How can you not order a roll named after the owner? While we waited for these next things, the benches were starting to be quite uncomfortable. No backs and a ridged lip were starting to make us shift about. We couldn't see what the Sushi chef was doing through the panel in front of us anyway, so while it was nice to be so close to the chef's we decided that next time we will sit in the dining room. Out came the rolls. I really think they are the same roll with very minor differences. Roe in one and cucumber wrapped around the other. I thought they were very tasty though. I only used a small bit of wasabi and soy, but that wasn't truly necessary, just habit. The spicy tuna didn't impress me as much, and it was here that I decided Yasu was truly more a Bistro than a sushi bar. Not in a bad way, just a note to myself that it's best for all the plated selections more so than the sushi. No reason for it NOT to be a fabulous sushi bar, as everything was so fresh, but something was missing for me and I couldn't put my finger on it. Some of the best fish I've had, yet not the best sushi?  Then we ordered the Salmon Sashimi. That was fabulous! Sliced thick enough, clean, amazingly smooth it reminded me I screwed up getting Blue Fin Toro as a sushi instead of Sashimi. I ate slowly, not wishing everything to be over yet, but my husband was full. I had come starving. I shouldn't do that! I batted my eyes a bit and said softly... Dessert?\n\nWe had the Green Tea Cheesecake with Chocolate fondue. They piped the cheesecake spirally onto three skewers and laid them each onto one topping: small bit of coconut, candied pineapple and pecans. The chocolate fondue was milk chocolate and was best used as a drizzle instead of a dip. I was very indelicate with the dessert, finding the skewer quite awkward. I just used my thumb and forefinger to slide the Cheesecake off and popped it into my mouth. I shrugged. Not classy of me, but it worked. I would use a harder cheesecake format and cube it for dipping, instead of that presentation, but it was different! \nOur cost with 18% tip was $125.\nAll in all I was very glad we went to Yasu and we will go again to try many more things. Very pleasant waitstaff, nice evening. Recommended.
5	uhm, this is the most amazing library i have been to, to date. it is simply ridiculous!!!! well organized, huge selection, TONS of seating and study carrels... this place is a bookworm's DREAM. \n\nbeautiful sections dedicated to kids, teens, etc.... and did i mention that media rentals are FREE!?!?!?! (socal libraries CHARGE you for cd and dvd rentals!) they have a great new books section, as well as tons of copies of new and highly requested books. simply divine.\n\nthe husband and i happened upon it early one saturday morning... and come to our surprise to find a HUGE line/crowd of people waiting for the doors to be opened!!! well... we soon realized why. \n\nwe will obviously be making this a regular spot... and i may even spend more saturday mornings here! love!!!!
4	I have been a fan of True Food at the Biltmore for a while now and recently decided to try this location. My husband and I loved our lunch. We started with the edamame dumplings which were very tasty. For mains my husband had the bison burger which he enjoyed and I tried the organic ricotta ravioli which was REALLY delicious! I also had their Red Moon drink which is made up of pink grapefruit, yuzu, agave and soda .... very tasty and refreshing. I have to say I prefer the location of this True Food ... love the outdoor seating and the nice open feel.
3	Living in Avondale I was excited to check out this place due to the rave reviews.  I ordered the machaca chimi.  Delish!  The chips and pico are wonderful.  The other salsa is a runny, roasted chipotle (adobo) sauce - good and not too spicy.  I am a refried beans lover and I was unimpressed by the beans.  I'm old school and love REAL refried beans with lard - sorry, I just do.  These beans were clearly mashed with either cheese or milk....They tasted like they were from a can.  Mexican rice was very good.  Only 3 stars from me - food was decent but there are better alternatives.
4	I have been frequenting this location for about 4 years (before I would go to the Flagstaff or Mesa stores) and always find great books- some that I was looking for and others I just came across. I've always loved the large travel, fiction and science fiction sections, as well as nonfiction, such as history, computers and psychology.\n\nRecently I bought a Wii game system and shopped games here. I noticed the used games seem overpriced, with semi-popular titles being well over $20, and even lame titles being at least that much. I was not impressed with the game section.\n\nOverall, I shop Bookman's for the books, and I appreciate the friendly staff and ability to trade in my own books and games for credit or cash.
4	Being a member of Costco does not only mean you will get a great deal on a jar of mayo equal to about ten it also means free samples. As in food samples! You come here on weeknight or better yet on a weekend and their will be carts everywhere with food samples. You can fill up for free on a bunch of tasty cuisine items! \n\nThey have a little bit of everything here. Grocery store known for huge quantity items, clothing, electronics, drugstore, picture printing, jewelry, furniture, books, and things for around the house. I actually don't have a membership I just go with my mom and sponge off of hers. I am not ashamed! \n\nAnother great thing about Costco is the cafe. It's not really a cafe more like a cafeteria, but the food is good and also super cheap. You can get great deals on whole pizzas or hot dogs, pretzels, frozen yogurt, and more. Most things on the menu are a whole dollar. So if the samples didn't do the job you can still eat here for super cheap. \n\nWal Mart has added Sam's Club to the scene which is a direct copy of Costco, but you know Costco was first and in my opinion is better!
1	This particular Harkins sucked the big one, when I used to go while living on the West side. After a few annoying experiences with the patrons and local gang bangers (one of the same in most cases), I quickly switched to the Harkins on Northern and the 101, until I escaped to the East side.\n\nYeah, two aggravating things come to mind when I think of this place, extremely loud in there every time and all the pot smoke clouds you get to walk through on your dangerous trek from your car to the front doors. Classy place...If you're a low life scum bag.
4	This place is such a great deal!  Sometimes there isn't a great variety, but if you don't see the dish that you want on the conveyor belt, you can request it from the sushi chefs.  They're really nice & accomodating.  They'll ask you how many plates you want too.  I usually only request one, and they put the rest of that roll on the conveyor belt.\n\nMy favorites include:\n-Hawaiian roll: spicy tuna topped w/ tuna\n-Spicy crab & shrimp roll\n-Haru sushi: two pieces of tuna wrapped around imitation crab & topped with a few slices of avocado\n-Haru popper (mispelled 'poper'): tempura-fried stuffed jalapenos\n-Crunchy California roll: I only eat this if it's topped w/ eel sauce (they should have a bottle of it there for you)\n-Vegas roll\n\nThe asparagus roll isn't good.  I've only tried it once, and refuse to try it again.  The rice was dry & so was the asparagus.\n\nI would say the quality of the fish isn't as good/fresh as Mido Sushi or Kabuki, but hey, it's only $1-$2 a plate!  Being a petite little Asian girl, I usually eat about 6 plates on my own.\n\nThe wait is terrible during dinner hours, especially on a Friday night.  However, the good part about this place (other than price) is that once you get table, you can immediately grab plates off of the conveyor belt!  I always end up grabbing at least two plates before actually sitting down & getting utensils from the waiter. :)
5	Forget about those fancy fro-yo places popping up at every corner, Baskin-Robbins is the best!\n\nThis Baskin-Robbins location has been around for years. I remember coming here with my parents as a wee little one, standing on my tippy toes with my hands and face pressed against the glass trying to pick one of the glorious 32 flavors (yes, they have 32 not 31 flavors at this location) I was going to indulge in on my sugar cone. I also remember riding my bike here as a tweenager with friends and discussing which Hanson brother we were going to marry (yup, I admitted that) while eating a banana royale because a sugar cone was so juvenile.\n\nAnyway, I came to this location with my mom, after a five year hiatus, and was pleasantly surprised with the remodel. The same family owns this location and still works the updated, clean counter. You can choose from 32 flavors of ice cream and sherbert, along with seven toppings (oreo, m&m, gummy bears, rainbow and chocolate sprinkles, hot chocolate, caramel), premade ice cream cakes and THEY STILL HAVE THE CLOWN CONES!!!!!! Those were also my favorite to choose from when I wasn't pressed up against the ice cream glass. BR's mint chocolate chip ice cream is the best! I haven't found anything nearly as delicious. I'm not sure if its the shaved chocolate in the ice cream or the crack (kidding), but its seriously addicting and I ended up buying a quart to enjoy at later times. Five stars for great memories, great ice cream, great service, and a great remodel!\n\nAnd FYI, all the Hanson brothers are married :(
5	My quick summary:  Great food & more than prepared to work with dietary restrictions.\n\nI know a lot of people complain about the noise level, but I happen to like it.  It really kind of goes with the whole experience.\n\nThe staff was really knowledgeable.  They knew what gluten free meant, and even the cashier knew off the top of her head that they had dedicated fryers, so the fries are also gluten free.  Most places look at me like I have eye growing out of my forehead.  And they'll customize your burger any way you like it.  Did you know they'll grill the jalapenos if you ask them?  I did.  :)\n\nThe soda machines are, in one word, awesome!  It's a touch screen.  You pick your drink type & it allows you to add flavor shots.  May I recommend the light cherry lemonade?  Great way to start a meal.\n\nThe burgers were perfect.  I watched the guy behind the line tenderly wrap mine in lettuce, since I can't have a bun.  And he then re-wrapped it after making sure the proper condiments had been put on (the guy in charge of that apparently wasn't sure).  The burger was wrapped so well, it really resembled a bun & I could have picked it up & eaten it with my hands, no problem.\n\nThe fries were warm, delicious, and plentiful.  They were seasoned perfectly.  My fiance & I shared a small order with our burgers, and there were still some left over.  Should have taken them to work & tortured my coworkers with the smell...  Oh well, there will always be next time.
1	"""SERVICE IS THE WORST IN SURPRISE. Read more to get my story. I made this account JUST so I could rate this place. I went here - the first time, with my boyfriend. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees. This is what happened:\n1. We got our drinks. \n2. Waitress asked for our order... we gave what we wanted for appetizers. After that, she immediately turned to another customer at the bar asking their order so we didn't get a chance to finish what we wanted for entrees. My boyfriend repeatedly said, \Mam\"""", and \""""Miss\"""", but she didn't notice us until after she took the other people's order. Even so - she didn't give us her full attention. \n3. We received our appetizers. I ordered another drink. \n4. 20 minutes go by and I still haven't gotten my drink, so I flag down a waitress and repeat to her that I ordered a drink and haven't received it. \n5. I get my drink. \n6. Another 30 minutes go by and we notice that people who ordered after us have eaten and are paying their bills. We flag down the waitress.\n7. Confusion ensues, she says our order was in the computer... doesn't even ADDRESS us, talks to the cook. \n8. We wait MORE, finally the cook apologizes to me, then comes back and asks us what we order and tells me that our food was delivered to another table. I said \""""OK\"""".\n9. We wait 5 minutes and I get my entree and bf gets his BUT IT IS NOT WHAT HE ORDERED.\n10. We flagged down the waitress AGAIN and told her that he didn't get what he ordered and she gets the cook. He comes out and asks what my boyfriend ordered. \n11. After my boyfriend orders, I try to talk to the cook and tell him that this service is unacceptable, it is our first time in this place and that the meal better be comped because we go to Pei Wei just down the way anyway... but BEFORE I COULD FINISH MY SENTENCE HE WALKED AWAY. \n12. My boyfriend got his meal. \n13. Waitress comes by, comps one beverage. Then, she makes excuses and she never apologizes. She tells us that they are just so busy and she has never seen it so busy, etc. \n14. At this point, I am not even hungry. I tried to tell the waitress that we are unhappy and that it was our first time here. She shook her head. A few minutes later she said to us, \""""Well was your food OK at least?\"""" Boyfriend said, \""""It was OK, can we get our check.\""""\n13. She brought us our check... they charged us for everything and didn't even try to win back our patronage. \n\nAfter such an AWFUL experience, I will never go back. I enjoyed the food but I wanted to have a romantic night out with my boyfriend and they RUINED it. I just got back and I am writing this review... Service was terrible in my opinion. They didn't try to win us back as costumers after REPEATED mistakes. I should have gotten an apology for EVERY mistake made, but I only received one apology, a cold shoulder (when the cook walked away when I was talking), a whole bunch of excuses, and one comped beverage.\n\nI will never be back. I will tell all my friends to never go there. I make a newsletter for a resort in Surprise that over 2 thousand people read and I will make sure to never advertise for Saigon Kitchen and I will let as many people know as I can why they should NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.  \n\nWe paid the bill, left. Wrote \""""WILL NOT RETURN\"""" on the waitress's copy, left no tip, and left. \n\nThanks for nothing, Saigon Kitchen. That was the first and last time for me."""""""
5	I love this place! where els can you go and get 3 types of hang outs in 1 bar. You have the down stairs where you can watch a live band (metelhead!) and listen to some great music. Then go outside and get a totally different vibe and you can actually talk to someone with out it being too loud. Go upstairs and it turns into a full on night club. Yeah this place is the best. THE HOTTEST SPOT FOR A SUNDAY NIGHT!!!  \n\nThe staff is very friendly and the bartenders are attractive and nice. I have read some of the reviews on here and I'm kinda shocked cuz i have never had a bad time at this bar. its been around for ever and still going strong.
4	Our first time coming here was about 8 years ago when we lived on 19th Ave & Dunlap; we liked it then & still do now. It's a smaller place located in a strip mall, you could drive by and never notice it. The chips and salsa are always fresh, the beans and rice are good. My boyfriend likes the green chicken enchiladas and I have gotten a variety of things all turned out good. I once ordered the taquitos and they were over cooked but besides that no complaints. They also sell bottled Mexican sodas and frescas that he loves to order instead of a fountain drink.
4	had a nightmare situation with a baby swing. \ngot one that made a crazy squeeking noise that never went away, then, about a month after getting it and 2 weeks after the baby started using it, the swing got even weirder. \nwe took it back to buy buy baby and they replaced it without hesitation, even though I didnt have the right receipt.\n\na few days later we returned the new swing again for a different model.\nthey were terribly helpful and gave us no trouble.\n\nwhen that 3rd swing was also not what we wanted, they very helpfully refunded us the total amount- even though they didnt have to.\n\nvery good customer service, even though i didnt end up keeping any of their swings.
4	Great food, good portions and affordable drinks. Huge selection of tequilas, in fact, ranging from $2 for cheap margaritas to well over $20 for the highest quality tequilas. \n\nWait staff can sometimes be slow, and waiting times are long immediately after work hours, but it's usually worth the wait.\n\nThe atmosphere ranges from casual to festive, and can get quite loud when one or more groups are seated. If you're looking for a yummy lunch or dinner and can handle a possibly raucous setting or medium grade service you'll be glad you came.
2	"""Being this was our first time here, the wait staff was extremely unhelpful. When I asked the waitress what she recommended for some Korean BBQ she answered \number 18,19,20,21,22,23,24\"""". Lol wtf?! Same thing when we asked for recommendations for a seafood plate which was very unhelpful. \n\nWe ended up ordering a crunchy roll, an order of cooked bulgogi, and a plate of sizzling jumbo shrimp. All of our plates came out in a timely manner except the bulgogi. When asked about it, the waitress played it off as though it accidentally got delivered to a different table. Now if you know bulgogi, it comes out in a loud sizzling plate that's pretty hard to miss. Being that this place is pretty small itself, I'm sure I would've heard it when my bulgogi came out - which it didn't. We tried to cancel the order since we were already done with our food anyways, but our waitress insisted that the plate was already being cooked. We waited for ANOTHER 20 mins before they finally brought our meat out, and by that time we were stuffed. \n\nThe food itself was ok, my only favorite was the flavorful bulgogi. Aside from that everything else is mediocre for the price. \n\nThe place wasn't crowded at all when we went, but the staff was a disorganized mess nonetheless. The lady took my sprite for a refill and didn't come back with it until we finished paying for dinner! Definitely will not be back."""""""
5	Ahhhhmazing! This place is so yummy and fresh!  I've had the salad (which they serve with a fresh made tortilla placed on the bottom), the tacos, the quesadillas, and the enchiladas. Was kind of meh about the enchiladas, but the grilled chicken and the sweet pork are fantastic in the tacos, salad and quesadillas. The setup is Chipotle-style in that you can pick your beans, rice and extras, but it was so immensely better than Chipotle. The ingredients are quality and fresh and the service is quick and friendly. If you're looking for a healthier option, this is the place to go!
4	"""I met my friend and her mom here tonight for dinner. We got here pretty early which was great because by the time we left, it was standing room early. Gotta love those early dinners :) \n\nWe were seated in the bar area and were promptly asked our drink order. When our first waiter arrived, he seemed friendly at first but when I asked him if the flirtini drink was any good, he proceeded to say \ If it wasn't good it wouldn't be on the menu\"""" We were like, that is not necessarily true but hmm ok. (Needless to say it was good though) \n\nI ordered the plate of sliders which came with miniatures of the WCG Cheeseburger, BBQ Bacon Burger and Maytag Burger and french fries. I asked that my fries be made without salt because lately I have noticed that fries seem to be caked with salt. Needless to say that when my fries arrived they were COVERED in salt. Ewwww... I looked around and out of nowhere, our new waitress Tiffany (who was also manning the bar) came over and asked if everything was ok. I told her that I had asked for fries with no salt and she said lets just leave these here and I will get some fresh ones out to you. About 5 mins later this huge plate of piping hot no salt added fries arrived and needless to say I devoured all of them. Yes I know greedy but they were so good. Oh and the miniature burgers were yummy as well but ended up bringing home a mini because I was stuffed from all the fries. \n\nMy friend and her mom ordered the rotisserie Chicken Rotisserie Chicken Cr\u00eapes which were filled with rotisserie chicken, spinach and a mushroom cream sauce and topped with madeira sauce and parmesan cheese. They both said that it was really good. We also ordered the AZ egg rolls which were traditional egg rolls filled with spicy grilled chicken, corn, black beans and jack cheeses. They had a salsa dip and a jalapeno dip and they were quite yummy. \n\nNow for dessert, my friend and her mom ordered white chocolate brownie to share. It had french vanilla ice cream, a warm white chocolate brownie, chocolate sauce and whipped cream with white chocolate shavings. I am not a fan of white chocolate but they both seemed to enjoy it. \n\nSo my experience at WCG was all in all a good one. I was with my fabulous friend and her adorable mom, plus Tiffany went above and beyond for us by just making sure we were ok. Hats off to you girl!"""""""
5	I heard they had a great selection of beers, wine, & spirits but wasn't prepared for what I saw when I entered the store.  It's like the alcohol section at Costco on steroids.  \n\nNear the front of the store is a section with stem/barware, wine chillers, kegorators etc.  Walking toward the rear from that section are aisles of wine with great signage enabling customers to find items quickly.  In the rear of the store are the refrigerated cases for beer and some juices.  In the rear-mid section you'll find more shelves with beer and a few aisles with snackie-cakes and yum-yums to accompany your beverages.  Then from the beer section going toward the front of the store are the spirits and liquors.  \n\nI found a great Hawaiian beer there!\n\nIf you spend $250, you get a 5% discount toward a future purchase after you sign up for a store discount shopper card.  \n\nGold stars for the great customer service, variety, affordable prices and store appearance/layout.  And it still has that 'new store' smell....
5	I had so much fun at NU last night! There was an live auction where you could bid on pieces created by the Crafty Chica (Kathy Murillo). Participation was free and you got a vial of Crafty Chica glitter and a glitterific auction paddle just for registering! My favorite part of the night was watching a lady outbid herself (3x) to win the Glitter Bull Dog..lol. Best of all proceeds went to benefit Valle del Sol. NU is by far my favorite event at the Heard!
5	These burgers pack a wallop. Seriously.  They are big, fresh, succulent, juicy, tender, and melt in your mouth, with the different textures of the toppings (depending on what you get) all perfectly complementing the meat.  Can't say enough about this place.. while there's something to be said about the bun (can get a little soggy on the bottom), this is definitely the best burger joint in the valley.  Get it medium-rare for the full tender experience, and an order of five guys-like fries (same lightness to it, but is crispier and fresher).  Plus a Sierra Nevada.  You won't regret it.\n\nI do find myself occasionaly feeling a twang of guilt looking at the big happy cow in the field of greens on the back wall... but that instantly subsides after taking a bite out of a burger.
3	Not the best lengua and cabeza tacos, but you could do much worse in the valley. The tongue was a bit more toothsome than tender, and the cabeza was a little on the greasy side. The carne asada was really well seasoned and not too fatty though, and the carnitas were tender perfection-- muy delicious. \n\nAll tacos are served in a doubled up corn tortillas, which was kind of blah. It was a bummer considering there the corn tortilla tasted more like filler because they were a bit stale. At least there was a very generous amount of meaty filling per taco, each of which is topped with onions and cilantro.\n\nThe atmosphere isn't much to speak of, but when looking for a good taco joint, this generally doesn't regsiter on my radar. They could really benefit from adding some grilled jalapenos on the side of their tacos, or at the very least putting together a kick ass salsa bar. You know, the kind where you go overboard and get a tiny plastic container of at least four types of salsa, pickled veggies and pico. Hells yeah. \n\nOh, but they don't have that here. They do have some cheap and filling options for Mexican food that are much more authentic than the 'Bertos mold. Hit it up if you're in the area, drop a fiver and feast!
3	My first visit to Market Bistro was to have dinner with fellow Yelpers Nadia C and Deb L. It was recommended by Deb and it was a nice surprise to find out about a cool eatery not too far from my home. It was a casual atmosphere, which I enjoy, and the food options looked enticing.  I was really contemplating getting a pizza, but figure it would be too much for me to eat, so instead I ordered a sandwich, while Nadia and Deb opted for salads. \n\nThe setup is a little confusing -- and that is mostly the reason I give it three stars -- as you have a couple stations where you can order your food: one for salad and one for the grill. But, if you can read, you can pretty much figure it out.  But, then after you order, I wasn't quite sure what to do. Do I wait there, watching them prepare it, or do I go straight to the cashier? Confusing.  But, I just went with the flow and eventually figured it out. \n\nBy second trip to Market Bistro was a little better -- I knew the drill, what to do, where to go, but it still was a bit awkward.  And, when I placed my pizza order, they just yelled it out to whoever was in charge of the pizza orders, and I had a feeling that my order might quite possibly get lost in translation. And, well, I was right.  After my parents and sister got their food, I sat at the table waiting and waiting.  After about ten minutes or so after seeing other people get their food after I had ordered mine, I went up to the cashier asking when my pizza would be ready.  And, of course, they forgot about it.  But, they put a rush on it, and I had it very shortly after that.  \n\nThe slice of pizza I got was okay -- nothing really special (I should have gotten two slices since one just wasn't enough for me). The sandwich I had the previous visit was much better.  It was very flavorful and the bread was delicious. And, I even tried a bit of Nadia's salad, and being that they are custom-made, it was as good as you could would want it to be. \n\nEven though I had an order mishap and the ordering setup is a little confusing, I will definitely give Market Bistro more tries.  It is a decently priced, good food, new hangout that I'll keep in my rotation.
5	I adore the atmosphere, food staff and prices here.  I go about once a week and the owners and waiters are like friends now.  They are the nicest, most hard working people and it really shows in the resturaunt.  \n\nThe food is consistantly amazing.  I never really cared for enchiladas, quesadillas or tamales until I had El Penasco's.  There hasn't been a dish that I have tried there that I haven't loved.\n\nMaybe the best part of the experience is the fresh tortillas and original green, mild salsa.  It comes with chips and red salsa too, but the tortillas and green salsa are amazing.  Above and beyond what can be found in other resturaunts.  \n\nThey have wonderful service with friendly, effective waiters and chefs, fantastic food and very reasonable prices.  Words cannot say how highly I recommend El Penasco.
2	"""Okay, to be fair, the two-star rating is based on a single visit to The Turf (no longer Turf Accountant, because that made no damn sense anyway). If it had been a better night, I would have given three, maybe even four stars. \n\nThe food was okay; better than average bar food, not as good as a restaurant that's really trying. We got a boxty, which was just a pile of veggies in white gravy under a potato pancake thing; kind of tasty, but weird. The salad wasn't bad. The chicken strips were average at best. The beer was good, the atmosphere was exactly what an Irish bar should be, the band was REALLY good.\n\nHowever.\n\nWe got their around 9 on First Friday. It wasn't as busy as I'd feared; we were seated right away, placed our order. Then we waited. For almost an hour. I saw food coming out at a steady pace from the kitchen; I assumed they were just backed up from the First Friday crowd.\n\nOur waiter came around to check on us again, and I finally mentioned that we were getting awfully hungry.  His response, and I swear to God I'm not making this up:  \Oh, did you order food?\""""\n\nI blinked at him, and focused on not killing him with my pint glass. Through clenched teeth I said slowly, \""""Yes. We did. A lot of it.\"""" \n\nHe ran back to the register and put our order in, and our food came out within minutes. I don't know what brain surgery procedure he was prematurely released from, but HOW THE HELL DO YOU FORGET TO PUT IN AN ORDER FOR AN ENTIRE TABLE? \n\nYes, it was only one mistake, by one person and not the entire restaurant, but it was a pretty fucking huge mistake. If the rest of the experience had been much over average, I might go back. But it wasn't. So I won't."""""""
3	I have to update this review based soley upon the graciousness and understanding that owner, Julian W. showed me after I gave La Bocca a decidedly unecessary low review.\nI still have yet to try La Bocca, and now that I am not living in Tempe anymore it might be a while before I venture back to Mill ave. but I desperately want to give this resto a shot\nWith local business owners like Julian W. around I think there is a lot of hope for phx's stiffled economy.\nKeep up the great work guys, I continue to hear nothing but great sentiments regarding La Bocca 8-)
1	"""I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, \not too long.\"""" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. \n\nOnce we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. \n\nI don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road."""""""
5	I have been taking my car here for washes for 2 years.  This is the best car wash place I have been to.  I would highly recommend it!  The prices are very reasonable, the staff is always offering me coupons same day to use, the car wash itself is great, the staff is extremely friendly, and I don't feel they are overly pushy for sales like some other car washes. \nToday, however, I had a new experience.  I lost my cell phone while I was there.  It was an extremely busy Saturday afternoon at a car wash, as you can imagine it would be.  You wouldn't have known it based on how the entire staff, including the owner, treated me.  They all helped me search  to find my phone.  I could not ask for better service than that!  =)
3	After reading other Yelper's reviews, my expectations were built up pretty high.  AZ Bread Company is a great place, no doubt, but I somehow feel let down.\n\nEveryone talks about how friendly the owners are and how they've been approached by them to ask how their meal was etc.  One of the owners was out cleaning and bussing tables and he talked to about three families right next to me but never came to ask me how my meal was.  Whatever.  \n\nThe place is set up like Jason's Deli or Chipotle in that you line up and order your meal then fetch your own drink and finally seat yourself.  They give you a laminated number tag that you can place at your table and when your order is ready they bring it to you.  They don't (or didn't for me, at least) bring your silverware to you.  I thought that was kind of lame.  They didn't even offer upon delivering the food and noticing that we had no utensils to eat with.  \n\nThe food, however, was definitely way above average.  I had breakfast there with my daughter and she had Strawberry French Toast and I had the breakfast special which was a breakfast burro with eggs, chorizo, cheese and a couple veggies.  My daughter had a bottled cranberry juice and I had coffee.  The total ran $18 which is way more than reasonable for breakfast of this quality.  \n\nI like drink stations.  I like being able to get a half cup 'warm up' and being able to get up and look around as I get my drink.  The big windows here are great for the ambient light they lend to the experience where you're eyes aren't hammered having to adjust to artificial light in dimly lit places.  The place is really colorful as well which is very inviting and festive. \n\nAll in all, it's a very safe place to bring your old ass grandparents and sketchy inlaws where you don't have to worry about freaking anyone out with a bad breakfast choice.  This place screams 'www.stuffwhitepeoplelike.com'.  \n\nYou probably fit the demographic, so go there.
4	This is a Fabulous Italian Place hidden in a strip mall! The small bistro has a cute and easy going setting with a very nice and friendly staff. I am a big fan of Italian food and this did not disappoint. The Spaghetti and meatballs ruled as well as the bread and oil they serve. So forget all the chain restaurants smothering the Arizona land and try Babbo. I cant wait to go back to try more off their menu.
5	We took our toddler to My Gym for a year when we first moved to Ahwatukee. The initial fees are high, but the classes are wonderful. All of the kids are engaged - they keep the group size small enough to keep everyone involved, but large enough where it feels like a party. We ended up cancelling our membership because they didn't have a class for older kids that fit our schedule. \n\nWe have attended two birthday parties at My Gym, and thrown a birthday party there as well. We had kids at the party ages 1- 6, and all of them had a great time. I would highly recommend this place for parties.\n\nFavorite things about the place: \n- every week, they change around the room, so it feels like a new experience\n- They have this cool line going across the room that kids can hang from - looks like so much fun\n- My toddler gained a lot of confidence in her motor skills and coordination from  this place.\n- All of the employees  are wonderful with kids.
5	This place is sexy....from the moment you start the slow descent down the stone steps you start to feel sexy ... .Anticipation starts to lick at you and you get the feeling you are about to experience something memorable.....The lower level of Rokerij Doesnt disappoint .\n\nUpon entering -you will be caressed by the cozy ,intimate ambiance .\nDimly lit with only 3 circular booth style table's, nice copper topped bar & a sexy hearth flanked by chairs ,wonderful framed artwork dripped from every wall = date night heaven.\n\nThe waiter came over immediately and was attentive throughout Dinner .\nSolid wine list offering by the glass , 2 glass pitcher or full bottle ,we had a New zealand red that was very good .\n\nAn eclectic menu to chose from ;\nI ordered the sausage plate which arrived piping hot ,four perfectly grilled spicy sausages layered atop pinto beans and a tottilla a more spicy meal than i anticipated and such a generous portion  that  i actually could not finish it and had to have it boxed up .( great box that they give you ,it is like receiving a gift)\nMy  dinner companion had the skewers over rice and beans and enjoyed it.\n\nEvery thing about the place was hot and sexy -you do not feel rushed as lingering is allowed here .....i recommend finishing your  wine by the hearth .\n\nAmbiance & great service = a fabulous night
4	The afternoon tea was FABULOUS!!!  Our servers took great care of us and even made my mom's day when they double-checked with me to ensure that yes, she really is the age I said she was.  We were celebrating my mom's birthday and I treated her to an evening stay at the Biltmore.  I must say that the AZ employee's rate is great and is what prompted us to stay!\nThe staff was incredibly helpful and friendly!  We asked for more towels and ended up with enough for us, the neighbors and maybe the entire hotel!\n\nA couple of downsides however --\n1.  I was expecting more luxury.  The AZ Biltmore is touted around here for being luxurious.  The stay was no more great than a stay at a Hilton (which they are owned by).  The property is old and is in a noticeable state of repair.  It needs work.  The rooms are cold and drafty, the wallpaper is peeling, and there is obvious wear and tear in the lobby.\n\n2.  Frank and Alberts = thumbs down.  The server disappeared for many minutes at a time and only refilled my water when asked.  The food was okay, but not worth the price.\n\nThat being said, we had a wonderful stay!  If you have not been, you must go, and take the time to go to the 3rd floor and check out the history room!
4	An Indian restaurant inside a Holiday Inn? If it were anything but Tandoori Times I might have thought twice before trying!\n\nI've only ordered takeout, but the food is as you'd expect if you've eaten at either of their other 2 locations, which is to say, its good.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant is modern and upscale, but both times I've picked up takeout the place was almost completely empty. If you show up and this is the case, don't be discouraged, the food is good and their bar looks fully stocked!
4	"""I enjoyed our night at Suede.  My husband I got there early and grabbed a few drinks ($4 Trump Vodka drinks- sa-weet!) and headed out to the patio.  I really liked the design of the place, especially the huge outdoor area.  Since we got there early in the night there wasn't a DJ playing yet and the only other patrons were two other young men.  As the night went on the crowd grew ever more interesting- from the undergrads that shared a table with us to the large group of 30/40 something men at the next table to what I would call here in Boston \fashionably challenged\"""" girls and meathead boys.  The DJ started around 10 and man, it brought me right back to my sophomore year in college.  (Circa 2000-2001)  He was spinning all the hits from 7 years ago!  Not that I didn't enjoy my sophomore year, it was awesome, it was just not expected.   Once again, it was another place in Scottsdale where we only spent about $50 or so on drinks for the night.\n\nAll in all though I did enjoy Suede and my husband and I will definitely be returning."""""""
5	Oye, que tal, mis amigos? This is the premier place if you want to find out what beef chimichangas should taste like. The place has all the charm of an abandoned warehouse, but the eats are second-to-none. Take some tortillas home, you'll be glad you did!\n\nBeen eating at this place faithfully for the past five years, and the quality has always been consistent. I get it to go, but sat in a few times to eat, as well. South Phoenix and close to Van Buren, what's not to like?
4	How I want to give this place 5 stars.  I grappled with it for at least 5 minutes before finally writing this.  \n\nThe location is killer.  Not only is it in 'Slope (which is an awesome neighborhood) but it is an old fire house (complete with garage doors) and has a beautifully shaded patio.  Really top notch.  \n\nThe panino I had, with manchengo, pesto, and salami was AMAZING.  Even the chips were good.\n\nThe menu was a little lacking in things that interested me but the one thing I found was simply the best.\n\nThe service was dreadfully slow.  For a couple sandwiches that should only take 5 minutes to make, the 15 we waited was too long.  \n\nI grapple with comparing this place to Postino because they are so similar but where Postino succeeds in great service, Bomberos food was just flat out better.  So many difficult decisions in life to make and choosing between these two wine bars could be the toughest.
5	This is my favorite pizza in town so far.  Yeah, it's kinda pricy, and sure, the location is not super luxe, but dammit if the pizza isn't brilliant!\n\nThe toppings are fresh, the crust is savory, and the best part - absolutely the best part - is the sauce.  It's fresh, sweet, and tangy - it's unlike any other sauce I've ever had.\n\nThis isn't cheep (it's not going to break the bank either), so if you're drunk and need a cheesy/greasy fix, hit up Little Caesars or Hungry Howies, but if you want some truly delicious and satisfying pizza, try Spinato's - you won't be sorry!
1	"""I am just going to hit on the new \Mill Avenue's New Year's Eve\"""" since most of the year, Mill Ave is exactly what you would expect so you should know if this is the kind of atmosphere you want to visit or not. \n\nBecause the Fiesta Bowl didn't find hosting the NYE block party as profitable, Tempe was left to execute the event alone starting 12/31/12. Previously, Mill was barricaded off, you had to pay to enter, and the block party included a variety of stages and outdoor vendors you could visit while mulling around the crowds or visiting the Mill Ave shops/bars. At the north end of the party was a stage that generally included a well known music performance. \n\nNow that Tempe has taken over, the only significant difference between NYE and any other night on Mill is the crowded sidewalks. Now, while I have a hard time faulting a non-profit for backing away from a losing venture, in the case of the Fiesta Bowl, an organization that has proven to be a private circle jerk for Arizona's most-connected individuals, where their organization benefits heavily from public support well beyond their NP status, they seem to only find losing ventures as those which do not provide the most value to the Fiesta Bowl members personally. The city of Tempe's 2012/2013 event was enough to make sure I don't return next year. \n\nHonestly, I don't even give one star reviews but there is nothing to savor about the event as a whole. It's free and you get exactly what you pay for -- crowds of people crammed onto the sidewalks so pedestrians can't move and traffic can't make it through the crowds that saturate the crosswalks. There is no organization so each bar is doing it's own thing (except more crowded/expensive than usual), and all the while, the only \""""entertainment\"""" is the same burnouts who always sit on Mill with their drum music trying to engage pedestrians for money.  \n\nBut should you still decide to go next year -- because the city's PR department will tell us that they've made it better than ever -- don't say I didn't warn you."""""""
4	I hold a special place in my heart for Switch, as it was my first experience with downtown(ish) Phoenix.  ( yeah I haven't lived in the valley of the sun for that long) They were new enough to where they didn't have there liquor license yet on my first go around, but I immediately fell for the place and have gone back several times.\n\nIt has some great things going for it that for me at least, outweigh the negatives\n\nThe atmosphere is great, very chill and the low lighting makes it a great place for first dates (everyone looks better in the dark!) The crowd generally ranges from your upper 20's and on. Usually more of a metro crowd but you'll see all types in here, which can make the people watching fun, especially if your seated at one of the couches.\n\nThe menu has a lot of variety and almost everyone will find something to enjoy. If your with a group of 4 or more, I recommend the fruit/cheese appetizer as it's way to much for 2 people but the selection and presentation is great. Also I know the mac and cheese is pretty highly recommended but it really wasn't my thing, and I generally love comfort food. \n\nThey have some great wines in their selection and the drinks like the sangria are usually pretty amazing. But like any place, it can be hit or miss depending on the bartender.\n\nI like the patio, once again it's great for people watching as anyone who parks in the back has to walk through it to get to the restaurant. But calling it a patio is semi generous, as its actually just a back alley with couches, chairs and heaters thrown in it. Still, there is something endearing about it, especially in the spring/fall.\n\nIf you go and like it, check out Ticoz and Fez as well, as they are are all owned by the same people and you really can't go wrong with any of them.
4	The atmosphere and staff are really great here. It's rather cozy without feeling cramped, although I've never been here while it's been crowded. The food here is quite good as far as Chandler goes, but you could get better and more at the same price elsewhere if you were willing to drive a little. Although I don't see why the cash only policy would actually deter someone from going, it is rather surprising for a place as nice as this. The salsa bar is very well stocked, and is probably the best reason to eat here. I've never drank here, but the bar always looks nice and moderately busy, if a bit small.

4	I did not eat anything here, so based from a bar patron's perspective, this place is a good bet. Early on a Sunday evening, Mabel's was pretty quiet so we were able to carry on with the staff and it was a much more enjoyable experience than what I expected from a place in Old Town. The bartender, Heeley, was a friendly guy who definitely liked to converse, and when we realzed almost all of the staff was like this, it was very nice. One of the waitresses was lighting candles and kept burning herself by holding the lighter upside down to reach the wick. When I told her she should hold the candle sideways and she wouldn't burn herself, she looked at me like I'd just invented a cure for cancer. Priceless!!!\n\nThey have some nice daytime specials, an inventive drink menu, and it is a very neat Victorian atmosphere. Good place.
3	Meh. That's what I've got.\n\nMy partner and I shared a Tom Kah soup. There was lots and lots of soup, but not much on the way of flavor. I found it a little bland...and even though it was on the vegetarian page, I thought it tasted slightly of chicken broth, so I didn't finish it, though I normal would have. Not stingy in the way of veggies, but not much flavor either...\n\nNow, I also ordered my panang curry mild...but here, no absence of taste. No, I was gulping down glass after glass of water. My partner tried it (she likes spicy food), and told me it was pretty spicy. I made it through the veggies and the tofu, but then had to stop. Way too spicy for me.\n\nAnother think was that there are no changes. I hate onions, and was not pleased that there was no way to order any of the other dishes without onions. Their service was also incredibly slow, but I've found that to be pretty typical of Thai places in AZ.\n\nI will say that my partner enjoyed her chicken dish, which actually came out at the spice level she asked for.\n\nI don't know if I'll go back again...I much prefer Tips 88 and Thaiger.
5	"""Dr Downs and the whole staff at Mountain Vista have been exceptionally kind, friendly, professional & extremely knowledgeable. I've only been seeing Dr Downs for a couple of weeks but seriously, after the first meeting with him, I knew I made the right decision to see him. I always thought that there really wasn't much to chiropractic care but I was wrong! I was accustomed to feeling  \out of sorts\"""", I figured, at my age, you're suppose to feel the aches and pains and to just  suck it up\nand get used to it. I kid you not, after the very first appointment, I woke up the next morning with NO ACHES & PAINS... I thought it was a fluke. It was not. I am on the road to feeling well and it makes me want to be more proactive in my health. After visiting with the staff, I am convinced that, if I want to be pain free and motivated to do & eat the right foods, Mountain Vista Health Center will steer me in the right direction.\nI am so happy my husband found this center & Dr. Downs. He's not JUST a Chiropractor, this center is a Wellness center. Thank you!"""""""
4	This is the best venue in the valley for what is intended to be; a midsize venue that attracts national touring acts, with a standing room only intimacy that you won't get at a place bigger or smaller. I saw Clutch here recently, and it rocked my balls off. I didn't drink at the place (took care of that before and after) so I can't comment on drink prices. Parking did suck, but there was a structure across the street for five bucks. One downside, going to the website to check out upcoming shows is tedious. The calendar is soooo hard to sort through, I would only go there to get more info on opening bands not listed on ticketmaster.com
3	"""3.5 stars...I really enjoyed this hotel stay...We came to see \the boys in blue\"""" play for some spring ball...Go Dodgers!!!  It was a smaller hotel and it was not a big chain like feel at all...It was more homelike....We stayed for a week and the staff there was pretty friendly and professional...The rooms were good sized...The 42 inch lcd screen tv helped...and it's an HD tv...it's got all the hook ups on the side...including for hdmi cables...so if you did want to hook up a ps3 or xbox you could easily...there was also free wi-fi...that was cool...some places you have to pay each day...You could tell it was an older hotel revamped to modern standards...The room came with a nice living room like quarters with a good size couch and dining table...it even came with a bar sink...the breakfast was actually quite good for a change...the staff there was on top of their game...they made sure that the guests had plenty of food and they kept refilling all the servings offered in the kitchen...they had a small gym with machines that were clean...and  a small pool and spa...they have communal computers and a printer...this place beats out some of the bigger chain hotels that i have stayed with..."""""""
4	I work just down the street and as anyone who works in this area can attest, lunch time is sheer madness!!! This place isn't visible if you are cruising around the front of this complex (the side that faces the frontage road) so I didn't even know it was here. I ended up around the backside of the complex because a Scottsdale cougar on a cellphone in her Beemer damn near killed me and I missed a turn (but that's a story for another day). I saw this place and was so irritated by my near death experience that I decided to stop looking for a place to eat and just eat here. \n\nI am sooo glad I did that!! This is my favorite lunch joint! The sandwiches are so good. The meat is real, not overly processed type lunch meat with too much sodium. The veggies are fresh and flavorful, the bread is great and the staff is really friendly. But the best part is the portions. Everyone is Scottsdale is so damn concerned with their appearance that everywhere you go is way overpriced and gives the tiniest little portions! But I work out alot and don't snack between meals so damnit I'M HUNGRY!! Big City gives you a good sized sandwich for a good price; about $7 for sandwich and chips or about $8 for a skyscraper sandwich and chips (friggin massive sandwich, so you best be hungry or plan on saving half of it for dinner if you're staying late at the office). \n\nSkip Wildflower or Paradise. The food at Big City is better, the service is WAYYYYY better, and the value is a hundred times better, so wouldn't you rather support a small-business owner instead of another faceless corporation?!!?
4	Came here last night with a girlfriend for diner to use a Groupon.\n\nSmall place, very cozy. I want to say, maybe 7 tables inside.But my friend did say there appeared to be a room for larger parties also.\n\nOrdered the bruschetta with beans on it... very tasty, but I never like bruschetta, wherever it's from, because the bread is always hard to bite through.\n\nWhen they brought our our meals, they had put her sides on the plate with MY pork, and vice versa. Not a big deal, just had to schooch some things around.\n\nAbs had the fish, which was salmon in caper and lemon sauce, with asparagus and ratatouille. She seems to like it until a few bites in when she asked me if it looked like the fish was undercooked in the center. And it was. She asked the server to cook it a little more and she did and brought it back a couple minutes later.\n\nI had the pork arista. Was tasty, but perhaps a little dry. i had the roasted beets and the orzo pasta as sides. I really liked the orzo which has sundried tomatoes and feta? cheese mixed in and tastes a little salty,a  little creamy. The beets were great too, but I love beets and am not sure you could screw a beet up.\n\nWe split a cannoli.  They put chocolate SPRINKLES on it! I hate sprinkles. In fact, i don't like cannoli either, but since she wanted it I decided we should order it. So that said, it was probably a fine cannoli. \n\nI'd go back.
2	I danced between 2 stars and 3 stars with this review.  I'll get to why I only gave it 2 in a minute.\n\nMy dad was REALLY excited to try this place out.  Asian buffets are his thing.  I like them too but I prefer upscale ones.  This one is upscale.\n\nIf you have read any of my other reviews you'll know I am a buffet junkie.  I love them and I will honor and cherish them as long as they take care of me.\n\nFirst off, this is the cleanest buffet in Arizona.  Hands down!  It's nice, spread out with seating and incredibly nice decor.  The layout of the food is great.  \n\nWith that being said, the dishes are your standard Asain fare with a twist.  You can tell the cooks take pride in the preparation and ingredients.  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS EVERYTHING IS COLD ONCE YOU GET IT TO YOUR TABLE.  All the food was incredibly luke warm.  If it was hot, it would have tasted better.  My dad went up to the manager and told them this.... Their response.....  IT'S THE A/C in the building.  That has to be the biggest crock of shit I have ever heard in my entire life.  I've been to plenty of buffets in the Valley and not once was the food cold.  They ran the A/C too. All the dishes were pretty cold, a health inspector would have a field day with this place. \n\nNow that I got that out of the way... The sushi layout was OUTSTANDING.  The fish was really fresh and they had almost any roll I could imagine.  I would have liked to have tried the crab legs but there were maybe 10 of them sitting in a bath of luke warm water.  It was like that the entire hour I was there.  The oysters were great..  Please keep in mind... I NEVER EAT OYSTERS AT A BUFFET.  It's the one thing I won't trust.  These were cold and fresh and delicious.  If you can eat $20 worth of sushi on one plate, this is the place for you.. You will get your money's worth.\n\nThe bottom line is this place is worth trying once.  After that, I don't think you can justify paying $20 for lukewarm food.  Judging by the managers response, this is an issue that will not go away anytime soon.\n\nAlso, our server was a real ass.  I am not sure if he just hates his life or was having a bad day, but he was pissed about something.  He slammed my drink down each time I asked for a refill and he was pissed that he had to bus his own tables.  If I did decide to go back here, I would ask for another waiter.  Also this place was dead on a Sunday at 6:30pm.  I don't think this place is going to make it.
2	I was really excited to hear about this place opening, the place is bright and huge, I liked what they were going for but in my book they totally missed the mark.  The patio is really inviting but it had a bunch of smokers so we stayed inside.\n\nDo they want to be a bar or a restaurant or what? The food stunk, all I could smell was grease when I came in needless to say we did not order any food.\n\nThe beer selection was not-so-great, completely unimpressed.  I have to admire that they want to support locals but come on, no Guinness?  Not even in a can or bottle.  Sorry ~ I'm a beer snob!\n\nThe best thing about this place was the staff, they were all super nice and friendly. I have to give them that. They get an A+\n\nBottom line, I'd go next door to Sushi Eye before I try them again.
5	I really like Carsten Salon, Ally in particular.  The desk staff have improved and are not any more snooty than at any other high-end salon.  It seems to go with the territory in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  I had tried severl other salons over the last few years trying to save money (Great Recession) but really think Carsten is the best salon in Phoenix.\n\nReally my loyalty is to Ally, she always gives me a perfect cut.  She is super nice and I've missed her.  If Ally left I would probably leave too, but for now I'm glad to be back.
4	We actually plotted this lunch place as a destination as an excuse to ride our shitty crusiers and 1-speeds from Tempe to Phoenix on a lovely day.\n\nMy friend is a hardcore vegan, I am a lactose intolerant vegetarian so most lunch places are a straight-up bust for us. But after wandering through Washington St and the awesomely bike friendly Campbell for almost 2 hours, we were thankful for this place being open.\n\nI had never been to this plaza before, a very cool old school strip mall courtyard with unique tiled storefronts, interesting lunch places, well maintained desert landscaping with lots of seating around cobblestone and places easily to lock up our bikes. Entering the herb shop, the sight of sage brushes and herbs may be vaguely Gremlins like, but don't let its pure hippie-ness dissuade you! To the left is a display case of all kinds of small ornate chocolates (how exactly does coconut curry work as a vegan truffle?) with very 8th dimension names of the Chakras. Here is where you may start to panic. BUT-still don't! This place is busy! Mostly hippie moms who want their organic tea w/organic local agave sweeteners and feeding their croc-ed footed little girls in hemp sweaters blueberry salad wraps, power lunches b/w women with asymetrical haircuts and Ellen Fisher cardigans and the random hot guy who probably does a lot of yoga and watches feminist porn. BUT-enough of the crowd!\n\nSettling into outside while lots of adorable United Colors of Bennetton children ran around in ironic t-shirts (Lock your Girls up!) and playing with wooden toys, I think the waitress simply didnt see us. So we went in, got our menus a little grouchily (dude, if you have been riding your bike a long while, you get ravenous) and our waitress answered all our questions about the pumpkin soup, if the green tea was available decaf, if the bread had egg in it, etc. The food came much quicker than I thought it would. My soup (which I thought she gave me a bowl instead of a cup, that is how large the serving was!) was the Pumpkin special, dairy and meat free and absolutely perfect texture. It went well with their homemade walnut and cranberry bread as an accompaniment.  My friend got the Cowgirl wrap, half size which really is large! Trust me, it is the size of a regular wrap and came with spicy lentils and fresh greens and so many kinds of good stuff and she got the side of Quinoa which is truly savory and warm and good stuff as another reviewer stated. I had to help her with her wrap and I couldn't finish my cup of soup. So while her wrap was $11 and my soup was $6, we still had food left over and had to force feed each other lunch. Our special Mango Green tea, the iced tea special of the day, was refilled at no extra charge and refilled pretty often. She even indulged in a sunflower nut butter filled dark chocolate cup (like Reeses but hippied the fuck OUT) for $2.50, which seemed kinda steep but she loved it, so, there you have that. All the salads looked fantastic, but this is very strictly lunch affair of salads, soups, sammies, and wraps so keep that in mind when you come here.\n\nWe were able to bring our bill over to the spice store since my friend needed to get herbs (and organic cat nip) and add it to the bill so she didnt have to keep pulling out her debit card. The ladies working the counter had unfortunate tie-dyed shirts on but were very friendly without being Stepford about it.\n\nAs a lunch stop while you are at work, unless you get speedier recognition than we did, I wouldn't recommend it. This is a leisurely lunch spot (or take home). There were at least 8 kids running around in the court yard screaming, so that was a little jarring. While we talked, I realized our neighbors could acutely hear everything we were saying which made me slightly more self conscious.\n\nA little more proactive-ness would get this place another star and some nice outside seating for the restaurant.
3	The drink itself was not bad, and is the best bubble tea I have had in the Valley so far; I think it is better than Boba Tea House and The Street.\n\nHowever, that lady that mostly everyone speaks about in other reviews, is in fact really unpleasant. She had a dirty look on her face the whole time while I ordered and definitely had attitude. She lightened up a little bit after I spoke Mandarin.\n\nThe store was not well-lit and warm. The drinks are also overpriced. $4.58 for bubble tea? Too much.
3	I went to OHSO with a large group of friends and we were seated really quickly even though the place was packed.  The ambiance is great.  The only reason why I gave it 3 stars was because I've been twice and wasn't extremely impressed with the food.  I'm a vegetarian and loved the fact that they have a veggie burger.  The burger was good, not amazing.  Another time I ordered some type of flat bread pizza which wasn't great.  One of my friends had the pulled pork and he LOVED it.
3	"""I lived here for a year and a half. My review will be very different from most people's (I guess). First, let me say that it's expensive here, about $800/month for a one bedroom and that's too much for \luxury\"""" apartments. They used to have a computer room with internet, but got rid of it, I guess, cause they figure by now everyone there had a laptop. They replaced it with a caf\u00e9. They have a gym, that saves on a ridiculous gym membership. Don't know if they have that still. There's a gorgeous pool, but the little wading pool to the side is not a spa, just a cold \""""children's\"""" pool. The people who live here are of questionable character. When my husband was at work, strange men would knock on my door around 10PM. Not cool. There was a drug-related shooting once in the building adjacent to ours. They put up a fence, however, it's just for show. I never saw the residents actually use the number punch device to get it because the gate automatically opens. Take it or leave it. \n\nWhat I really want to talk about is a little discovery I've made: #P104 is haunted. We lived in it. The first week we lived there I had a weird dream in which I was following a little blonde girl wearing an old-fashioned dress down the hallway. She was trying to show me something but I was too scared to look. Then we started seeing dark shadows above our bed when trying to go to bed. Another time a glass we had on the counter shattered violently. I would be standing in the living room and I could hear a soft pitter patter of feet down the hallway and going past me. (No pets.) The maintenance man who'd worked there for twenty years informed us that the place dates back to the 60's and used to be a part of ASU. If a little girl was murdered there, there's no record of it."""""""
5	Best Moscow Mule I've had in a long while.\n\nHave been here a few times now, and it never disappoints. Everyone knows the drinks are fantastic - I doubt you'll find better mixed drinks anywhere in Scottsdale except for upstairs at R+D. \n\nWhat surprised me was the food. The mixed salad (the one with its own Facebook page) was great. Awesome mix of things, with just enough meat to give it substance. The hummus was well prepared with tasty pita wedges.\nFor the main course, the coffee-crusted short ribs are can't miss. It comes with a tart cherry sauce that sets the whole thing off.\nThe scallops were amazing as well, perfectly cooked which can be hard to find.\n\nAfter dinner we went up to Citizen R+D where the drinks are on a whole other level.
1	Thought we would check it out since it had received a few good reviews. I won't be back.No bathrooms...Have to go over to Subway for that. Not a big deal to me that it is a dive in a nice area or no bathrooms. Food is what is important...right?  Found meat on our food to be tough and burnt. Not tasty. Dry too. Won't be back. I can get a better meal at Ramiros or Filibertos just a short distance. Found it pricey too compared to competition.
4	Went here for the first time with a girlfriend recently. I had a Groupon that was expiring and thought this would be a great place to start our day. I was right!  We got there about quarter to noon and there was a little bit of line, but it gave us time to decide what we wanted and peruse the goodies in the store. I selected the chicken fajita wrap and the gf had the tuscan chicken sandwich... Both were delicious. The fajita chicken with the black beans and guacamole was just what my taste buds were craving.... I ate every single bite of that yumminess!  The chocolate raspberry bar from the pastry selections was delicious as well. They have a couple flavors of fresh-brewed iced teas and a fresh lemonade that were very good too. Its slightly pricey at around 9-10 bucks for a sandwich with no sides, but the ingredients are fresh and the its a nice setting to enjoy lunch. I look forward to trying another yummy menu selection in the future!
5	This is one of the better festivals I have been to here in AZ. The selection for food is HUGE! So much to choose from. I went with full intentions to satisfy my plate lunch craving and that's what I got. Delicious chicken teriyaki with rice & mac salad. Besides that there was every kind of meat imaginable, kahlua pig, shrimp, lomi lomi salmon, banana egg rolls, malasadas, kona coffee, the list goes on.\n\nThere are lots of booths with interesting crafts. I loved the Hawaiian snacks tents where you could find every kind of dried fruit and lots of authentic Hawaiian and Asian inspired candies. The entertainment was great too - there were dance acts, bands, and more on stages throughout the festival. And on a hot day what's better than a real shave ice? So refreshing and love the little ice cream surprise on the bottom.
3	Sure the place has atmosphere and a good drink menu, but I prioritize the eats. \n\nWe went on a Monday night for a friend's birthday with a semi-large group and they did a prixe-fix menu. I left hungry after paying more than the meal deserved. \n\nThe bad: Shumai was just ok, duck mint salad had an unharmonious flavor and I refused to eat it, chicken with wasabi sauce was dried out, lychee wrapped bacon was soggy and a strange proportion, cream and goat cheese dessert with peach was not fun. \n\nThe good: the Hong Kong rice noodles and fried tofu with pinapple sauce were the highlights and only things I would eat again. They were really tasty. But I won't be eating them again, because I don't plan to go back. \n\nI'm sure there's some gems here, as we found a few, but I need a better batting average and, oh, I dunno, to leave full with a few bucks left in my wallet?
1	"""As much as I am a lover of all W's due to the trendy scene, the touch of details and the unique style to a hotel stay. I have to say that the W Scottsdale does provide all of this BUT the rudeness of the staff takes away from all the positives. I stayed there in May this past year and had a bad experience with staff- I recall saying to myself \Well never going back there again\"""" Well, like any loyal person, I gave it a go again when they were having their Phoenix Suns Gala...I encountered the same rude staff and they even seemed to get more rude. I will always be a fan of W's but I will never return to this one."""""""
4	Found this on the second to last day of my stay in Tempe and went right back on my last day. Pretty much everything about this place is good (except that it is a Fox undertaking . . .)\nThe Prosecco was delicious and came in a beautiful glass, the kale salad was amazing (though it was a bit more lightly dresses on the first go around, which was in fact, better), the gazpacho was decent, the squash casserole was cheesy goodness, the farmers market salad was simply good all around, and the flourless chocolate cake was soft and chocolatey on the inside but overdone-brownie-like on the outside. Though I did not try it, they offer a gluten-free pizza - hello!\nWould definitely come back.
5	Wow, I usually don't completely disagree with all the other reviews but I had a totally different experience in here.\n\nShopping for a washer/dryer/fridge for a new house...had already been to depot to compare prices and stopped at the best buy across the street from this lowe's to compare there too.   Best buy has probably the worst service on the planet, so I pretty much just made notes on models and prices from there but didn't get any good information only spoke to one guy there who had no knowledge of really anything..\n\nWent across the street to this lowes and was helped by Henry.  He was really top notch, very knowledgeable and helpful.  Since the prices were inline and they had a labor day sale period going on I bought all three appliances on the spot here.
2	Great location on Pinnacle Peak with no real pizza competition for miles.  Parking is adequate, and seating wasn't too bad during lunch hour.\n\nLunch slice special was par for the course, with 2 slices and drink for around $5.  Sauce was above average and homemade, but everything else was mediocre at best - crust, cheese, toppings.  Service was ok, menu selection is typical pizza/pasta delivery joint menu with a few basics and fried apps.  I wouldn't avoid eating here in the future but I would make a notable effort to find pizza elsewhere if I'm craving a slice.
5	Rice Paper is a great place near downtown to get great tasting and fairly authentic V food. I ordered the Bun with pork, which is my favorite V dish. It was great and the helping of grilled pork was substantial - I wasn't left hungry and craving meat after my meal. The bartender was great - she was always present and asking if we needed anything. For being such a small restaurant, there was a great selection of beer and spirits (though I didn't partake, because I had to make it back to work). I was in and out in less than an hour, which is great for a lunch spot. My only complaint is that there isn't a lot of parking. I had to park down the street on a side street. But I guess the fact that the place was full and that there wasn't any parking is a good sign...
4	"""- 1 * because it's a CHAIN... How disappointing. But, I have got to give this place/corporation high marks for the name. Genuwine and ballsy. And the \accessories\"""" they sell advertising their very own Pink Taco are ingenious too. \n\nSo, we just had to have the pink tacos, 3 chix tacos, \""""TJ style\"""" and they were pretty damn tasty. The fact that the bartendress gave us our drinks free wasn't too shabby either... Maybe she saw us reading the \""""Lesbian Coming Out Manual\"""" (last one off the shelf @ the Borders down the Street, see the separate review) and felt sorry for us? It was a joke, really... She's straight. I am not. Go figure."""""""
5	this was an amazing experience that takes dedication, committment, passion and love.  Lilke a fine cook uses the freshest ingredients in their meal preparation, what you put into it is what you get out.  this was the most physically demanding, and mentally challenging event I have ever participated in.  In the end, it was all well worth it. In fact I look forward to the next one.  The event was well run and extremely organized. The crowd support was amazing and motivational.  I look forward to volunteering the future to help the next iron athletes achieve their goals.  the day was the hottest day in AZ to date at 95 degrees for the year and had 25 mph winds.  This made the finish line even more sweet.  of the 2035 or so athletes we saw a 19 percent attrition rate of people who didn't finish. this is one of the worst in Ironman History. This was no doubt due to the extreme weather conditions.  In the end of a race like this its not longer about time but rather finishing and pushing through the temorary hardships mentally and physcially.  I was so elated to have made it to the finish line I didn't even hear the announcer say my name.  However, it didn't matter. Embracing the medal at the line is like embracing your newborn at birth. You hold onto that puppy like your life depends on it and feel so relieved and full of joy that words can't even describe the emotion.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about embarking on an ironman journey to make the first step .... SIGN UP TODAY and good luck. Zack
4	Other than a snotty girl who seated us in a crappy table and told us there wasn't anywhere else available, despite our reserving a booth, we had a wonderful time.  We quickly realized we were not going to deal with the attitude hostess girl and went back to the front desk where they promptly seated us in a booth.  The snotty girl needs to realize who is paying her salary - ugh, the customer!!  The rest of our evening was wonderful.  Excellent service, great food.  The Filet Mignon, chipotle mac & cheese that is always to die for and nice french green beans with mushrooms. Pricey but great food and so worth it for a special occasion.
4	Just went here looking to find some things that my regular places don't stock and stumbled into a fantastic surprise.  It is under new ownership and went from one of the more expensive places to one of the cheaper.  \n\nStock has improved as well.  I noticed the giant stack of empty boxes that were for sale for $5 before is gone.  Maybe they charge less or just give them away.  \n\nDefinitely going to visit here more than once a year with the new improvements.
4	Pasand is under new ownership and the changes already seem good. I went there today expecting the same old stuff. What I got was some truely excellent tasting food. The food was leaps and bounds above the previous food. The spices were much more distinct and flavorful and especially fresh. In talking with the owners they were going to rennovate the run downinside and add some more buffet places. Overall I approve of what has been down to the place especially the food.
5	You're gonna want to put your eatin' dress on for this place. I have been going to the fry bread house for almost 2 years now and have never had a bad experience. I actually heard about this place from many Phoenicians but wasn't really a fan of fried bread. The food is always phenomenal, the prices are great and you know you're going to leave with a full belly. I went back recently and am not sure if I somehow overlooked it but I noticed that now they have menudo on their menu! Not just served on Saturdays and Sundays like other places. It was excellent! It had a spicy kick to it and was not uber greasy like some places make...actually many places. I find the staff friendly, the environment comfy with all of it's earth tones, and an overall awesome little place to go when you want something hearty. I actually have family that when in town, they come here straight away!
5	LOVE LOVE LOVE X 1000.  This place lived up to all of our expectations and recommendations and I only wish I would have checked it out sooner.  We went on a crowded Saturday night with some friends and made sure to have reservations.  The staff was beyond nice and so friendly and the place was bananas packed.  \n\nThe food was superb.  I mean, seriously great.  I ordered the Scallops with a light brown sugar sauce and asaparagus on the side.  The Bf ordered the 8oz filet mignon and the twice baked potato side.  We each ordered 2 drinks a piece, which, I have to say Eddie V's makes a damn good dirty martini and their blue cheese stuffed olives are to DIE for.  \n\nThen dessert...oh sweet sweet dessert.  The bananas' foster was undeniabley the best dessert I have ever had.  It comes out flaming and the ice cream (we got vanilla, I detest butter pecan ice cream) was perfect to the warm goo-ey-ness of the cake which was a little carmel like...there are no words to explain how amazing this dessert was.\n\nAll in all with 4 drinks, an app, 2 meals, 2 accompaniements and dessert with tip for under $200..yhis place is a no brainer.
3	I'm seriously behind in my Yelp reviews, but here's what I remember:\n\nThe hostess had no hosting skills.  If you're going to walk by me 117 times before seating me, you could at least acknowledge I'm waiting.  \n\nThe server had no serving skills whatsoever.  Do you seriously need to reach over me to take the condiments off the table and give them to someone else?  Petty, I know.  She was at least friendly and adequately attentive.\n\nThankfully, the cook had some degree of cooking skills.  I had the Western sliders (challah rolls filled with BBQ brisket) and while nothing spectacular, it was solidly A-OK.  I think I prefer the Jewish sliders (brisket minus the BBQ, add a potato pancake).\n\nMy favorite part of Chompie's is the window shopping after dinner in the bakery.  Sadly we were unable to be helped in the small window of time I had before the plus one decided it was taking too long.  A decision he later regretted I'm sure.
2	The momma wanted to give this place a try back in November, so we did. I think momma might go back but we won't... Too far to drive for the cost, freezing cold dining room, and moderate quality. I really think we would have done better at Long John Silvers.  It pains me to lob a bad review to a local joint, but when I have to peel my fish out of the overly thick, greasy breading to find a total of less than 3 oz of meat inside, for over $12, I can't give any better... And I froze half to death while doing it!
3	Great happy hour, even on Saturday. All the drinks are either a dollar or two off and the appetizers are all half price. Plenty of places to sit, provided you get there early or if you call and make a reservation. ( Make sure to do that if you have a large group) The chicken wings I ordered were ok but the sweet potatoe fries were AWESOME! All in all a great place to watch any sport event that may be happening with a group of friends.
5	I ate at St. Francis last night with some friends.  We tried five of the appetizers, including some kind of fried potato fingers, a pizza thing with figs and prosciutto, a fresh salad, some green beans, a cucumber and tomato mix... I thought I was in heaven.  The fresh baked bread was great too.  \n\nThen came the entrees!  I had the roast chicken.  Some got the pork chop, and burger.  Everything was seasoned to perfection.  We also tried several of the desserts.  My favorite was some kind of caramel-date cake.  Sounds funny, but it was really really good. \n\n The service was outstanding, attentive, genuine, not overbearing. Atmosphere is wonderful.  Although it's busy, I was never neglected.  I can't wait to go there again.
4	"""Yum. I just finished a nice bowl of Veggie Pho with Shiitake mushrooms, Asparagus, Bean Sprouts, Jalapenos and Basil. The broth was very Goldilocks-jussst right. Before the soup came I had a very tasty spring roll called the \Enlighten Me\"""" with jalapeno, jicama, asparagus, rice noodles and sriracha. Though these were very similar ingredients to the Pho, this Spring Roll had it's own unique flavor experience. Everything had great heat.\n\nThe restaurant itself is a converted old house on 7th Street and a little small. My girlfriend and I went at 2:00 pm and the place was pretty full, so I can't imagine what a weekend dinner there might be like. The service was friendly and took good care of us.\n\nIs this the greatest Vietnamese restaurant, ever? No, but it was friendly, fresh and delicious enough to put it in my restaurant rotation. I will definitely be back."""""""
4	I came to Fogo de Chao for AZ Restaurant Week in 2010.  The first disclaimer is that you have to be a serious meat eater if you want to enjoy all the benefits.  I do not eat beef as a Hindu, but I was actually able to enjoy quite a bit of the experience.  I got an opportunity to eat really good BBQ Chicken, sausage, a hybrid chicken-pork dish, and several seafood items from the buffet tray.  \n\nFogo de Chao is very similar to tradition Brazilian BBQ.  I have actually been to a Brazilian BBQ in Rio, so I know this was very authentic.  You start off at the salad bar which has other small items such as cheese, seafood, and fruit.  You have quite a wide array of seafood to enjoy for non-red meat eaters.  You then sit down in your table and you get a button.  Green means bring it on!  Red means, stop for now or game over!  If you have your button turned to green, you will get constantly questioned about food.  I made this mistake in Brazil, and I had everyone and their mom come to my table asking if I wanted food.  I was so into the food, I didn't realize this simple little rule.  Once you want to call it quits for good, you get a selection of a few desert items.\n\nI think Fogo de Chao does a good job replicating the traditional Brazilian BBQ.  The quality of food is very similar from what my red-meat eating friends tell me.  This is a good taste of Brazilian BBQ if you do not want to travel all the way to Brazil.
4	"""The food is excellent - certainly the best Italian food in the East Valley. We are definitely \regulars\"""" there, usually once a month for the past few yrs. My one complaint, and I've even written the owner on this before, is the service. Now i don't mind waiting for good food, that's not the problem, problem is you can never find a waitress. Need a drink refill? You're best bet is to walk up to the bar with your empty glass. The wait staff is very unorganized. I think part of that reason is because they hire mostly just family members, instead of qualified waitstaff. After 2 yrs of going to this place, we finally introduced ourselves to the owners. You would think they would have introduced themselves to us for how often we were there. Not a \""""friendly\"""" dinner, but certainly GREAT food. And best pizza, hands-down. We usually order take-out from here now."""""""
4	You know those douchebags that yell and scream at the television and chest bump after every play on Sundays? You can find them here. This is one of the reasons I like this place, because I can be one of those douchebags.\n\nOn Sundays it gets PACKED here. My friends snagged a spot early today so I just pulled up a chair to their table. You can hardly walk around the place. Normally this would anger me, but if I can see my football team play I could care less.\n\nThey have all the televisions labeled with the games of the day so you can make sure you have a good view of your team's game. From what I've been told, the owner seems to be a Patriots fan, because almost every Sunday that is the game that has the sound streaming. Totally fine by me.\n\nIf you are going to watch the Cardinals game, GET THERE EARLY. Or else you will be standing at the entrance squinting at the televisions, waiting for your table to be ready.\n\nFood is typical bar food. They have specials on Sundays on drinks and food so you don't spend a lot of money getting trashed and trash talking the Dallas (or whatever team you despise) fan next to you.\n\nIf you like to enjoy a football game without people looking at you like you are crazy, this is the place to go.
2	My husband had gone to a different location than Ahwatukee and said how great it was.  He stopped on the way home from work one night and got us a pizza.  I was not real impressed, thought the sauce was a little sweet and the crust was just ok, kind of soggy.  A few weeks ago we tried again and ordered the specialty spinach pie.  It was delivered cold and super soggy.  Was so bad we couldn't eat it so I called and spoke  to the manager and he gave us a credit for another pizza.  Tried it again tonight.  This time we ordered thick crust half mushroom half sausage.  It was disgusting!  Came cold again, the crust was so dry that is cut the inside of my mouth.  Sauce has way too much sugar in it.  We won't be going there anymore.  We each ate one piece then threw the whole large pie away, what a waste!!  The salad also had the wrong dressing with it and the lettuce was warm and wilty.  Sorry Spinato's but just being honest.
3	"""Pizza is one of the few things in life that even when it is bad, it is good. I would like to give them 5 stars because we have seen this place at its best and they rock. However, there are times they make Pizza Hut seem like an upgrade. McDonald's makes millions not by making a great hamburger, but by making a consistently bad burger. You know what to expect, and the expectation is consistently met. \n\nOur family and friends incorporated this restaurant into our routine and have been there many times. Occasionally we'll have them deliver, but usually we hang out there. They make a good pizza at a fair price. Place is generally well kept and service is friendly and courteous. You can watch the Diamondbacks AND Suns while the kids watch Nick on the big screen. It's a family restaurant and you are likely to experience someone testing boundaries. If you can't stand being exposed to the process of child rearing they deliver. \n\nYou are reading this because you should be forewarned: When they are busy they are not very good. The timing is off, the food quality is poor... ok, they're bad. Yogi Berra once said of a popular restaurant: \Nobody goes there no more, it's too crowded!\"""" If you can walk up to the counter and order, then easily find a table - you'll enjoy the experience. If there is a line and no tables - it's a gamble. \nIf you've been and left without joy, give them a try when they're not weeded. \n\nRecommend light sauce and extra cheese with whatever toppings appeal to you. \nGluten free unlikely to affect you appetite, tastes good enough to add a pant size."""""""
5	I always forget to review this place.  This is one of our fave spots on First Fridays.  I don't remember the Tea place next door, but after we wandered with our hot vegan teas, we found this place.  I love the mix media installation, psychological and contemporary art showcased.  Different artists' works rotate ever so often.  Most of the art is so uncontrived.  It doesn't follow the mass appeal like most of the galleries in the surrounding area.  That intrigues me.  I'm no art critic, but I can foresee some Eye Lounge artists with unique talents will do quite well.
4	It was busy when I was here and the service was above average considering that. Our server was prompt with refills and the food arrived quick enough for me. The food was definitly good but I cant say I was like holy crap that was like a angel farted in my mouth. I used to work at Cowboy Ciao as a chef and the style of the dishes reminded me a lot of our menu. Southwest with some unexpected twists. Over all it was a good dinning experience . I would return. Price for 2 with 2 N/A beers, lemonade, a split app, main and both had dessert with coffee was $96 before tip.
5	I loooove Pita Jungle!  Their food is incredible and healthy - a rare treat these days.  The hummus that kicks things off is some of the best I've ever had.  I've stuck to a few dishes including the Chicken Masala and the  black bean burger (I'm not a vegetarian, but I prefer it to real burgers now!).  I have yet to find hippy health food that compares.  The servers are always really nice and attentive, and best of all it's fairly cheap.  I would definitely eat here every day if there was one closer to old town!
5	Some people may call me an a$$ hole, some may call me intelligent, some say I'm a talker.  Some people call me a Space Cowboy, Some people call me Maurice... whooot whooo.  I for one, like to call my self a Gyro Connoisseur.  I have been to almost every Gyro joint in AZ.  Not to mention quite a few in NYC and Boston.  This is hands down, with out a doubt, the greatest Mediterranean restaurant in AZ.  If you have tried a Gyro and thought it was too greasy and tasted like an over salted soggy strip of beef jerky.  You were probably right, because that is how most places destroy the savory goodness of which is known as Gyro meet.  You need to muster up every bit of strenth to try and forget the past and indulge yourself by trying the Gyro House's perfected adaptation of the Gyro.  \n\nThe portions are very generous, which is pretty standard for most Greek places.  Although,the fact that it is run by a small friendly family of true Greek's, and not some hokey white dude with a crew of hispanics running the kitchen.  Brings a warm sense of family comfort that you can feel when you walk in, but you can taste as well.  \n\nThe fresh baklava is always available and reasonably priced.  Not to mention, home made!  \n\nThankfully, the hole in the wall, all you can eat BBQ place closed down next door, and they took over the bigger corner suite.  There is more room to sit and relax in the new space, which is nice.  There was nothing worse than looking forward to a nice big Greek Salad w/ gyro meat for lunch and realizing that all the tables were taken up by the loyal lunch crowd that used to pack into the old place every day around noon.
5	After my last two favs went out of business, this is the new go to place for Froyo.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Orange Leaf, it's just not as close to my house as the other two favs.  This is a destination location, meaning we're on a mission for yogurt when we come.  I guess I'm a little tarted out because I'm really enjoying the white chocolate strawberry and forgoing all tart flavors.  The strawberry cheesecake is also good, but not as good as the white chocolate.   Also, the fruit is always fresh.  This is key for taste and makes my dessert super healthy.  The decor is very trendy and orange, naturally.  The TVs are a big hit with the kids, and the background music is a nice touch.  There always seem to be a few patrons, but also a few available seats for us.
4	"""Five Good Things and Five Bad Things About The Phoenix Art Museum: Or Ten Things You Can Say About The Phoenix Art Museum and Sound Pretentious.\n\nGood Things\n\n1: Yayoi Kusama' piece \You Who Are Getting Obliterated In The Dancing Swarm Of Fireflies\"""". If you were lucky enough to be in any city were the Ecstasy exhibit toured a few years back, this will definitely bring back memories of that experience. This was the one piece that I felt really made the visit to this place. It's probably the most engaging piece they have at this museum. It's like Cornelia Parker's \""""Anti-Mass\"""" on acid (a piece which is also housed in this museum and worth checking out).\n\n2: The samurai armor and weapons section. Overall, I thought the Asian Art exhibit at the museum was kinda \""""meh\"""". It's the usual pottery and calligraphy fare, but this was something I was not expecting and was pleasantly surprised.\n\n3: The Khalo, Riveras, O'Keefes, Picasso, Keith Harring, and Candida Hofer. These are really the finest pieces of non-classical art that are housed here. Be sure to check them out.\n\n4: The museum has a couple of lookout spots with great views of the city hidden away at various corners.\n\n5: The architecture and design of the building alone are works of art. Everything from the fountain outside to the spaces created inside that really allow you to engage in the art form. \n\nBad Things\n\n1: For me, the art here is kinda hit or miss. I feel like a few of the pieces are really good and engaging, where some of others are just average to dull.\n\n2: Waaaaaaaay too much Western Art. I know it's a part of our state's history, but really? I could go to some gallery in Old Town that pedals this stuff to tourists and old money in Scottsdale whose idea of fine art is a place mat set from the Louvre.\n\n3: The last couple of traveling exhibits that came through here are so-so. Generally, all art museums are like this. Not everything they decide to show is going to please everyone, and I can accept that.\n\n4: There really aren't a whole lot of sculptures or installations here. I don't think the museum should limit itself to a majority of paintings and photography. Something different would probably break up some of the monotony you start to feel after 30 mins.\n\n5: The museum's store kinda sucks. I like a museum store to have tons of books, dvd's, or other hard-to-find art-related items that I can really only get at a museum store. I felt like this place was decently stocked with their books but everything else is just kinda kitschy shirts and an overload of Frida Khalo memorabilia."""""""
4	Let me start out by saying that my ONLY critique and the ONLY reason I didn't give them five stars, is I made reservations on Open Table and because of a lot of people lingering in the restaurant, they put us in the bar.  But, I have to say that really turned out to be not a bad thing as our server was excellent, the food was excellent and the wine was smooth and wondeful.  I had their 16th St short rib stew (and kuddos that you have a small portion option) and it was scrumptious.  I practically licked the plate and you always know its a winner when I don't offer to have anyone taste my dish.  It had been a long time since we were there and I doubt if it will be a long time before we go back.
3	went back to the cork and experienced the fall menu. i am afraid that my second experience was not sa good as my first. the service was great,the resturant beautiful,but the food did not make me say yum yum with each bite like my first visit. 3 of us had the rabitt risoto and none of us really liked it. the scollops were great the fig salad was ok but the duck was so over done it was like power and way too salty. the creme brule came it was about 3/4 a cup portion $6.00 that was rediculuslly too small of a desert for $6.00 get real CORK i am afraid this will be my last visit. there are too many choices . Like Roy's Hawian Fusion Cusiene , Roy's is more cosistent and flavorable and mor reasanablly priced sorry CORK
2	EVERYBODY raves about this place so I finally went with a friend last week.  I wish I hadn't heard so many good things prior to going because I was severely disapointed.  \nService was AWFUL.  We came at 4 pm so we could get in abotu 3 glasses of wine before the $5 wine ended.  WRONG.  It took 30 minutes each time we ordered a glass of wine and I mean 30 minutes from the time we ordered it.  When we went to order the 2nd glass of wine it was 2 minutes after 5 and luckily since we complained we still got it for the $5 price.  The bruschetta also took an excessive amount of time to come and 2 of the cut pieces had fell of somewhere so we got jipped!  Let me say I once was a server for many years.  This place was not that busy and definetly not so busy that it takes 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.\n\nFood was ok.  I didn't think the bruschetta was anything special like all my friends made it seem.  I liked the salmon pesto one, but thats about it.\n\nI know this review sounds mean and since I have heard such great things I am willing to give this place another try.  I will order a panini and hopefully get quicker service.  If things are better I will be happy to revise my review- if not I will put Postino's in my OVERRATED category
4	"""I finally found a place that does great pedicures and manicures.  The masque for feet is only $5.00 extra and OMG! It's an amazing cool-a-ped experience.  It's got some sort of mint or somethinig.  It feels hot then cold and it's the best way to relax whle on your feet all day! I always go to Cindy. She is nice, attentive and friendly.  She might give you a \freebie\"""" service too. :)  I also got a mani by her and she did a great job.  She is careful and always smiles.  I have yet to get any acrylic full set as of yet. Im debating it. But If I do I will be sure to post a review!  \n\nNo waxing for me.  I went hair laser removal crazy a few years back! NOW that is sooooooooo worth the money!"""""""
4	"""Ahh\nwhat a great place to watch, hear, and feel some live music. The Rhythm Room has an \electric feel\"""" to it! It is a great spot for the blues, some really talented blues acts pass thru here on a regular basis. I would say the best time i had here was a few months back when The AppleSeed Cast played, in it's entirety, Low Level Owl vol. I&II. OMFG what a great intimate space to hear such sprawling ear drum shattering prog rock!\nMy face was melted.\nThe Rhythm Room's layout is a little akward for sure, what with that stomach level pony wall that segregates the crowd, it's such a bitch getting stuck behind that thing. Assumably it's to divide up the 21 on under crowds but i wouldnt know, maybe when it was designed in the early 70's or whenever these sort of 1/4 walls were all the rage, personally i'd just as soon knock it down and open up the space. meh no big.\nIf you are a music fan, and enjoy cheap stiff drinks, i'd say this is one of the many great venues in phx that can provide both in heavy doses."""""""
4	I am giving my seal of approval to The Vig for a few simple, straightforward reasons:\n\n*$3.50 pints during Happy Hour\n*Decent selection of beer, including Stella and Pinstripe (mmm)\n*So-good-you-want-to-moan artichoke dip (which would be that much better if served with warm pita bread; not chips)\n*Cool decor with a spacious, modern outside patio\n*Friendly and attentive service\n*Beautiful and/or interesting people to watch\n*Fave candle and hand lotion in the ladies room\n*Attracts an array of patrons, like muscle-y tat guys, Euro intellects,  buxom beauties, network engineers and writers\n*Trivial Pursuit cards on each table - woohoo!\n\nA few negatives to note:\n*5-spiced edamama was totally meh; will never order this again\n*Sweet potato fries were served with regular ketchup - bleh\n*Has a somewhat chaotic/disorganized feel, inside and out\n*Smoking is permitted on the outside patio\n*If you don't valet, you must part across the street\n*Could use a couple more beers on tap!\n\nAll in all, a very nice place to grab HH after a hard day's work. \n\nDuring HH the apps are 1/2 off, which allows you to order a couple to share and sample. Between my friend and I, we each had 2 beers and shared 3 apps, totaling only $30. Not bad when you split the cost. \n\nPlus, our server was a genuine and friendly gal, as was the stunning hostess who greeted us the moment we walked through the door.
5	"""Today a few friends decided to go to the Main Ingredient for lunch. We were the first of the lunch crowd so we got our pick of seating. We were placed right by the front door, which was left open for us to enjoy the breeze and the connection with the  outside. It made me feel like I was in a close friends home :)\n\n Ok so we get seated and start talking and immediately the first thing that captures my imagination was the music. I was told that the owner puts together the mix and I'll tell you,  that mix is so amazing. I mean there is enough familiarity of songs to make you feel comfortable, but some obscure stuff as well to expand your listening pleasure.. we were talking about \ who's that?\"""" or \""""I gotta get that track\"""" ...a very chill vibe.  Now our server, she was very cool.. she had an easy smile and a relaxed funny personality  that added to the comfortable fun experience that was building from the time we got there. Now the food.  I am not a food critic but I know what I like and I liked my food and so did everyone else at my table. So we're just chilling eating and our server is taking care of us smiling and just being fly... kinda of a small thing but there also  laughter coming from where the other employees were. The kind of joyful belly laugh  where you could tell that they liked working there...for me,  this added to the good feeling. All in all  I felt we experienced magic today..\n\nI would recommend The Main Ingredient Ale House and Cafe to anyone!"""""""
2	A few friends and I went to this place and before going in asked about a gluten free menu (I have a friend who cannot eat gluten).  We were informed that they do not have a gluten free menu but the wait staff can point out which items can be made gluten free.  Okay, sounds good.  We decide to eat there.  We sat out on the patio, which was very nice and not too hot with the misters going even in the heat of summer.  However when our waitress finally came over to talk to us about the menu the first thing she pointed out as gluten free was the one pasta dish on the menu.  Realizing that there is a disconnect on what it means to be gluten free she said she would check with the chef.  She returns to say no on the pasta (okay good call) and then proceeds to say that one of the salads would be good.  However the salad had blue cheese on it, which is not gluten free.  So, we realized quickly that they had no clue what it means to be gluten free and she was safer ordering the lobster with butter.  \n\nI ordered the steak, since that is what they are know for, and was disappointed that it was overcooked and rather salty for my taste.  I would have asked to return it except that it took so long to get that steak and I had already witnessed the table next to us send something back to the chef (the Kobe burger which was undercooked for that table) and it took forever for them to return with a new order.  I sucked it up and just ate it.  \n\nOverall I felt the place was over priced and poorly staffed.  Our waitress did not seem knowledgeable about the menu and as I stated earlier it did not appear that anyone understood how to accommodate a gluten free diet--after being told they could.  Plus the waitress was not slammed with tables and yet did not seem to be available to us or other tables for questions or refills.  I had high hopes since this is a Fox restaurant and I like so many of their places, but was very disappointed.  I doubt I would go back to this place and given it was not full on a Saturday night I don't think I am the only one who feels that way.
2	Their sushi is really good.  We got the Hawaiian roll with the seered albacore tuna.  The flavor was really good and held up to the wasabi.  The warm baked salmon roll with sour cream was even better.  Teriyaki roll was just okay.\n\nThe service was just plain bad.  When you only order 3 dishes and all you have to do is take an order and deliver one dish for each person.  What do you do on your free time?  Surely not forget my miso soup and forget to give me my wasabi.  There were a total of 4 tables to attend to for 2 waitresses.  I had to tell the waitress about refilling my tea and bringing my wasabi midway through my dish when I could not stand being thirsty.  The older lady got sounded agitated when I asked her about the soy paper for some strange reason and said it was an extra dollar.  I told her I was just wondering...jeez!\n\nNevertheless, they did not deserve any tip, but we did tip around 7%.  We are ordering take out from now on.  They have good food and this latest visit was just bad compared to other previous mediocre visits.
4	Had a great lunch there today and I have to say that we absolutely loved it! Great location and love the outdoor covered seating! Excellent food. The Thai Shrimp dumplings were a hit as were the Spicy Miso Edamame! The beautiful wife had a tasty sashimi tuna salad -- a bit plain but still good. I had the Spicy Red Chili Shrimp noodles! It was very tasty! So many wonderful things on the menu; all pretty healthy too! Can't wait to go back!
4	I didn't start coming here until I was 21 and it was worth the wait! I am not a huge beer drinker but the peach beer is delicious! All the red wines are great with the food (which is quite scrumptious as well)! Happy hour is a great time to go. It is always packed though, no matter what time of day so parking can be hard to find sometimes. Four Peaks is definitely worth walking a block or two for!
5	Crust is kinda hidden and I didn't really know what to expect when going in... I was surprised to see so many reviews on file here. It's tucked away behind a grocery store. I've eaten at the sushi place next door before, but I think that was before Crust moved in. \n\nAnyway, I was in here today to speak with one of the owners and left with a giant pizza. It looked too delicious to not take one home. You can see the giant open mouth oven with a giant flame toasting up the goodness as you walk in. They were making some interesting odd-shaped pies and their toppings looked high quality. Of course, they hand-toss.\n\nThe decor was really nice and I definitely want to come back to have a sit-down dinner. They have a Gelato bar in the corner as well and it took every ounce of strength for me not to order up some of that too... gotta watch my weight, right? The staff was all really nice and the part-owner was really cool.\n\nWhen I got home with my pizza, it was still really hot and gooey... gotta love how well pizza travels in Arizona. Giant flavorful pepperonis and huge chunks of fresh juicy pineapple covered the pie and the sauce was very unique - they apparently bottle it up for sale. \n\nIt's a little on the spendy side, but you definitely get what you pay for. I'm a fan now and this only goes to further solidify my belief that Arizona is one of the best places in the country to find awesome pizza.
3	Cafe Portobello is now the Twisted Lizard.  I stopped in to catch a little of the MNF game.  Of course, I ran into a few folks from the neighborhood.\n\nThey ditched the Italian theme and have a new contemporary menu.  The sandwiches, entrees and lahvosh look good.\n\nI just kicked back at the bar and had a Dos Equis Amber and watched the game on one of the many flat screen TVs.  At $3, the cold beer tasted really good.\n\nI hope the new owners can bring this great neighborhood place up to it's true potential.
4	"""I was glad to find another dim-sum place in this area because the one we used to frequent of the same name (minus \Buffet\"""") closed down on Ray and Dobson.   We walked in on a weekday afternoon for dim-sum lunch and were quickly seated.  The ladies were quick with stopping by with carts of little stainless-steel containers.  They popped the top off and would say what they were (of course she could've said \""""fried donkey ears\"""" in Chinese and I would'n't have known the difference)... my friend and I tried maybe 4 or 5 little dim-sum plates plus noodles for my friend and the bill was... gasp... 12 dollars total - yeah, SUPER cheap! \n\nI don't know what good or bad dim-sum is, but I know that this was filling, flavorful, priced well and when I googled what I ate later that night, my pics looked the same as those online.  Note that there was definitely a language barrier, but be patient.. they offer good service and you're definitely being served by hard-working staff.  I would return for dim-sum again here."""""""
5	Alexi's is somewhere between Greek and Italian, closer to the latter. No matter - each entree is outstanding in its own right. Last time in the desert cannelloni was spicy and delicious - and totally hopped up on chile peppers. The salmon salad - magnificent - and perfectly cooked. The food is excellent AND it's a great place to hob-nob. The area has a loyal clientele of movers and shakers. Alexi's is highly recommended in midtown - one of the best places especially for lunch in Phoenix.
3	"""Nothing too special about Moto Sushi outside of their sushi desert which consists of ice cream, nutella, and brownie rolled into a layer of rice krispies and sliced \like sushi.\""""  That might be the only thing sushi about it...because it's \""""sliced like sushi.\""""  If I sliced a crawfish into sushi roll shapes, would I be able to market it sliced \""""like sushi\""""?  It was a fun end of the meal treat.\n\nOutside of that unique desert experience, their sushi was just so so.  The waitress had a \""""secret menu\"""" that she did not even inform us until we had got our order.  My co worker then proceeded to order another roll after we found out about this secret menu.  I'm not sure what is the point of the secret menu if they don't show it to you until you after you receive your food.  What's the point?"""""""
3	The double-double cheese burger animal style is good. Not a big fan of the fries they are a little to healthy for me. It you want a burger and do not want to get out of the car and do not want to go to McDonald's this is your spot. \n\nWhen I eat burgers I want a good burger so I do not go to In-N-Out very often. \n\nThis location is often busy too so there is always a little bit of a wait.
5	Mia Francesca is FANTASTIC! As a Chicago native I was so excited when I learned that Francesca's had decided to open in the valley, especially since they are so close to home. Tonight we are headed back for our third visit to introduce more friends to the Mia Francesca experience.\n\nWe have always encountered friendly service and excellent food. In the beginning there were a few inconsistencies in the service, but that's forgivable since the food is so great and they are a new restaurant.\n\nMia Francesca changes their menu regularly, that's the reason it's hand written. Even with a one page menu they offer a wide variety of selections. Typically you will find:\n\nA wide variety of salads and appetizers\nSeveral Pizza choices\nSix Pasta dishes\nSix Entrees \nA GREAT dessert menu\na nice wine list \n\nIf they don't have exactly what you like or you have a special dietary restriction, ask if they will make it. They did it for me and my niece on our latest visit. I wanted goat cheese added to my pasta and she is vegetarian...no problem. \n\nFrancesca's isn't your typical Italian restaurant and that's a good thing! It is just what North Scottsdale and DC Ranch Marketplace especially needed.
3	Ambiance: great. Appetizers: also good. The wine list: abysmal. Nothing under $50 was even drinkable. And everything over $50 was grossly overpriced. They have no sommelier on staff either. Next time, I'll just stop by Total Wine around the corner and pay a corkage fee.\n\nProbably the BEST table bread I've had anywhere in The Valley. It was the closest thing to a real sourdough available in this state. Very tasty, and worth a visit just for that.\n\nWe had a horribly novice server that made the beginning of our meal frustrating. However, we complained to the manager, and then suddenly we had people falling all over themselves to take care of us. Good save, Brio.\n\nThe entrees were also a good save. The whole demeanor of our table changed when the main courses arrived. Wow, everything was really great. Good quality, good flavor, good presentation. We were delighted. The food was definitely a notch above any of the other Italian restaurants around.\n\nOverall, not a bad choice if you live in the area. I don't know if it's worth a long drive, but it's a solid restaurant. Frankly, it's probably at least 4-Star worthy, but too many things went wrong on our first visit. Still, I'll be back (and hopefully be able to bump it up another star afterward).
5	What I love about Oregano's is that it never disappoints. The staff is always friendly, the food is always good, and the wait is long enough that you have time to enjoy a glass of wine (or two) before sitting down to dinner. I've been going to Oregno's for many years now and except for the time my car got towed from in front of the knitting shop, I've never had a bad experience.\r\n\r\nDon't come to Oregano's if you're looking for nothing but food. Oregano's is all about the experience -- fun and casual, but not exactly a quick bite to eat. Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato Pizza is THE best and the Pasta Basta rocks, too.
5	"""I've been going to the Wag N' Wash for three years - ever since I brought home Frankie, my toy Australian Shepherd. For the first two years, I fed him nothing but Wellness brand foods. It's a wonderful brand that's organic, with tons of variations- all/most carried at the Wag N' Wash. The owners are super knowledgeable about all of the food they carry, and actually suggested switching to the frozen raw meat when Frankie's stomach began to sour. It's been the only thing he can tolerate for over a year now, and thank goodness the folks at the WN'W carry a steady supply. \n\nThey have tons of pet toys, treats, health supplements, leashes, brushes, beds, etc... they even sell doggie ice cream (which I bought for Frankie to celebrate both his first and second birthdays). And if you're in the mood for some fresh, custom treats, you're in luck! The Wag N' Wash also has a bakery where they sell a huge variety of treats. \n\nThe \wash\"""" portion of the Wag 'N Wash is equally as great as the store portion. They provide all of the supplies you could need for a wash, and the price is great - $15 for a premium wash! The staff is always available and interested to provide help or advice at any time. I'd have to say that coming to the Wag N' Wash is always a positive experience, and I'm so glad that I found it!"""""""
4	"""The burgers were tasty and the outside dining was nice. Overall the restaurant was along the lines of gastro-pub chic.\n\nThere was a good selection of pre-arranged burgers or lots of choices to \build your own\"""" including 5 different meats, cheeses, fois grois, etc. \n\nThere were multiple aioli options available to choose from. After we got our burgers we thought they would also be good with the fries / sweet potato fries so something to try. Also they give you a fair amount so you definitely could share the aoili amongst 3-4 burgers if you wanted to.\n\nThe beer and wine selection both were extensive including full descriptions of the flavors of each listed on the menu.\n\nWorth a visit."""""""
5	I am a new pet owner and was very skeptical about taking my toy poodle to the vet to get a health certificate because I didn't want to be taken advantage of. I went to the Family Vet Care in Ahwatukee and was extremely impressed. All the ladies there made us feel super special and took pictures of Sandie my toy poodle. They took great care of us. I loved the office, the service, and the price. It was very affordable and top quality. They also offer grooming and boarding. I normally take Sandie to Petsmart but because I loved FVC so much I will be bringing my grooming business to them from now on.
1	I went here for the first time last night and I thought I was going to have a good meal.  The bread was good and my salad looked good until I found a bug in it that was laying on its back with it's legs still moving.  All they did was offer to replace my salad.  Needless to say, I was utterly disgusted and found myself looking through my entree to make sure there wasn't another bug anywhere in it.  I had the filet stuffed with fontina and mushrooms.  Had I not been so worried about finding another bug in my food, I probably would have thoroughly enjoyed the steak because it actually tasted really good, but after the salad my meal was ruined.
1	I posted a review here almost a year ago, and since then the Native New Yorker is no longer in business at this location. All I can say is good riddance! I knew they would'nt be around for very long. This was the trashiest sportsbar around except for maybe Teakwoods which was about a block away from this place, and they are no longer around also. Glad to see both these places gone forever!  My favorites are Tavern Grill, and Goldies.
2	Being new to the Phoenix area we were looking forward to finding a Thai restaurant, since we eat Thai fairly often. Going off of the Yelp reviews, we decided to try Swaddee. We ordered the Tom Ka soup with tofu instead of chicken, and the Pad See-ew with soft tofu, and the veggie rolls (to go). The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than we're used to, which was a nice surprise. The Tom Ka soup was a little more sour than we're used to, but overall still tasty. However, it was almost $11 which we felt was about double what it should have cost. The Pad See-ew was the most disappointing part of the meal. The flavor was fine, nothing special but not bad. However, it was pretty dry and sticky, like you'd expect from a cheap college Thai take-out joint.\n\nOverall nothing really stood out. We had high hopes since the meals were on the pricey end for take-out, but we've had far better Thai for half the price. We'll keep looking for a better Thai place to become our local go-to!
5	"""What a little gem in Gilbert! Didn't even know it was there until a friend invited me out to meet her there for \80's Night\"""" of all things. 80's night at a wine bar? A DJ at a wine bar? But it all worked, and I really dig the place. \n\nServers and bartender were all super friendly, met the owners who were also nice, bartender gave me a free glass of wine, and overall just had a really nice time. \n\nLooking forward to their $20 tastings on Fridays. Sounds like an awesome deal (4 or 5 glasses plus an appetizer)! Oh yeah - and they have Yappy Hour/Brunch where you can bring your pooch (check their calendar). Awesome. Will be back here for sure."""""""
4	Had a girls' lunch here the other day and was pretty impressed with the food and atmosphere.  I had the Voodoo Penne and it was amazing!!  The bread and olive oil/balsamic vinegar dipping sauce was just okay.  I actually think Carrabba's has the best bread and dipping sauce around.  But anyway, we split of bottle of wine that was delicious.  And for dessert, we split the creme brulee and tiramisu.  Wasn't crazy about the creme brulee, but then that's not my type of dessert.  The tiramisu was incredible!\n\nI will definitely return to this restaurant with my hubby for a date night.  Hopefully it will be cool enough to sit on the patio as it looked delightful and romantic.
2	"""Service was slow, and the server had a slight attitude the entire night. We had 7 people at a large table in the center of the restaurant, and had brought in four bottles of wine purchased from the place next door. Every course took at 30-45 minutes to bring out, which was fine because we were happy and celebrating. Dishes were brought out a couple at a time, with a few minutes in between. I ordered a drink twice, which was really not a big deal. The server however was impatient when we couldn't decide on things immediately, or that my sister asked about the cheese that came on the steak. She and her husband keep kosher... she didn't need to explain herself, but he was not very accommodating. She also asked for some bread that didn't touch the pork on the charcuterie plate. She was brought a plate of 4 bite size slices.\n\nI didn't have too many issues with this restaurant until the bill came. The food had been rich and good. My dad, who *never* makes a stink about price discrepancies, pointed out to the waiter that he thought the corkage fee was waived if you purchased the wine next door. The waiter said no, that's not true. My dad pulled up the Zagat's review where it says that, word for word. We just had 7 people eating 3-4 courses each, and you can't waive the corkage fee for 4 bottles?? A customer service-oriented person would have apologized for the confusion and waived the fee. A somewhat customer service-savvy person would have apologized and waived half the fee. This server said \Yeah, we've been trying to get Zagat's to take that out for a long time. It's wrong.\""""\n\nDecent food, but don't expect service to be on par with the prices."""""""
1	"""If I could give this place negative stars I would. I have never been so humiliated in my whole life. I was there on a sunday evening for my 21st birthday and they denied my I.D. even though I had my social security card, my bank card my school I.D. and my medical card. I was made to stand up in the middle of the restaurant, take off my shoes, sign my signature twice, call my friends phone to show my name and still denied service. At this point I was in tears as my two friends asked if we needed to pay for the fries we did not even touch and the manager said NO.  As we left to go to Dave and Busters next door the manager from Cadillac Ranch had called there and said we \refused\"""" to pay and we were not let into any of the surrounding restaurants. Keep in mind this was my 21st birthday.  I will make sure that NO ONE I KNOW will EVER go to Cadillac Ranch."""""""
5	"""OK, I don't know if just because one of the items on the menu is perfection, a restaurant deserves 5 stars. I've been back several times...err, weekly. I have a standing Tuesday \Hot dogs & Burgers\"""" date with my 2 year old:) The burgers are outstanding! Juicy and flavorful. I always add bacon, cheese and giardinera (sp?) and it's so good! Lobby and his crew are very nice too. I may have to start doing our date bimonthly because my waist (and probably my arteries) are suffering!"""""""
1	I will be the contrarian on Detours.  I would not do it again or recommend it.  Net/net I paid $480 to have someone drive me and my daughter to the Grand Canyon and back.  If you are expecting a tour or to see something other than you could do yourself, you will be disappointed.\nI did the two day tour to Sedona and Grand Canyon.  Here are the highlights.....   I was picked up at 6:30.  We drove around for an hour picking other people up.   We stopped an hour later for roadside gas and mcdonald.  Then an hour later we did the Sedona Tour - which was drive through downtown and stop in uptown.  We stopped for an hour to visit all the wonderful tourist tee shirt shops.  Then we left.  (There is so much more to see in Sedona.  To say this was seeing/touring Sedona was a joke.)  We then drove to the Grand Canyon.  They dropped us off at 1:30.  We'll see you tomorrow at 1:30.  They picked us up the next day.  Next was to be the tour of the Navajo Reservation, which was a joke.   We stopped at some roadside stand to look at jewelery, trinkets, etc.  Then drove back to Phoenix after another gas stop.    The scenery and drive are great.  If I had it to do over again I would have rented a car or hired a private driver.  It was a lot of coin for a driver.
5	Had to write them another quick review since my first review of Tutti's.  Tutti Santi has become my only Italian restaurant that I'll go to in Phoenix....folks it simply is the best in town.  I've become a regular here, and the entire restaurant treats you like family...its always a joy coming in here.  If I could rate them 10 stars, I would.  Everything I've tried on the menu is outstanding...their pasta's are some of the best I've ever tried.  I could go on and on about this place, but I'll just keep it simple.....GO HERE!  And sit at the bar with Deb....she will take wonderful care of you.
4	I'm from Texas, so I'm used to Tex-Mex, and this was a little different, mostly in a good way.\n\nI had a combo to try some different things.\n1) Beef taco - fantastic, the taco shell was fresh and the beef was delicious\n2) Red beef tamale - the biggest tamale I have ever seen.  Maybe too big, as the beef flavor was lost\n3) Bean burrito - fairly plain, beans and some cheese in a tortilla, no sauce or anything.\n\nThe rice and beans were good, and the side of guac I got tasted just like I make at home, so I was happy with it.  The margarita was also decent, nothing fancy but tasty and with a salted cup - not frozen junk out of a machine, but freshly made.\n\nUnfortunately the salsa didn't impress me, but I think that is because I'm used to a thicker salsa.  It was runny with some chili seeds that gave a little kick, but not a lot of flavor.\n\nI'd go back though, I think I'd try a chimi or more tacos next time.
3	"""So once I filled up my flask of goldschlager last night, I headed off to go see the Besnard Lakes at Modified. It was a typically vacant concert at Modified like most I have been to.\n\nThis is partially do to good reason as this place is a terrible venue for a concert. The band and crowd have to be very small to enjoy a concert . The place is extremely small, the stage very low, and every spot in the venue is uncomfortably close and awkward. The band also has to be packing their own equipment because the sound there is terrible.\n\nMy worst experience with the sound there was actually a packed beyond capacity night when Clap Your Hands Say Yea and the National came. This was part due to CYHSY being one of the worst live bands in existence, part due to the frontman's god awful voice, but also heavily due to the house PA that crackled and breaked and blurted unevenly as he belted his patented cat-in-a-meat-grinder vocals.\n\nBut now in the present they are making strides to make this place less of a shithole. They finished giving the outside a slick new look with some corregated metal and some new windows. They are now switching their focus inside which means unfortunately no art right now, which is usually the best thing about going to a show there.\n\nThe two house speakers also appear to have been upgraded because the sound for Besnard Lakes (fuckin trippy man) and Starvin Hungry when combined with the bands' own equipment was great.\n\nThe other main issue of course is their complete lack of alcohol. However, I found out in an interview I had at Dial (of all places) that you can bring in your own. The guy I was interviewing with was in a band that played there sometimes and said you can bring in closed cans. (I didn't get the job by the way, don't talk about alcohol in an interview kids) Last night I asked a guy who worked there and he said the policy is that they don't allow you to bring alcohol in, but if they can't tell its alcohol they won't care. But now with the Lost Leaf and Roosevelt within walking distance you can always get a fix between sets if you don't want to bring alcohol there on your own.\n\nThis place, like many in Phoenix, reminds me of a great spot in Tucson that somehow the \superior\"""" city managed to royally screw up.  In this case its Solar Culture, the Tucson arthouse/music venue where they freely and openly allow you to bring in alcohol. People go there with backpacks of booze. It's awesome. It is also much larger and taller with a raised stage and better sound system and way more art.\n\nModified gets 2 stars as a music venue. 4 stars as an art gallery. Averaged to 3."""""""
3	The 10th fairway of Raven South Mountain smells delcious. The overwhelming smell of wood, BBQ, and good down home cooking overwhelems you. We decided to have an early dinner after the golf round was over.\n\nIt's a small, clean restaurant and they put some money into marketing with a big fancy sign, and a text message club, etc. Our server was helpful, but not very nice and very indifferent toward us. We were the only ones in the restaurant, so it wouldn't have been tough to just be nice to us and give us quality service.\n\nI was with my family and we ordered dinners. I ordered the pork rib and brisket dinner with black eyed peas and mac and cheese. Dad had the pork rib dinner with red beans and fried cabbage, and mom ordered the rib tip and brisket dinner with black eyed peas and red beans. Waitress came back about ten minutes after we ordered saying they were out of pork ribs and I got the last order, so my dad had to change his to pulled pork, then five minutes later they said they were out of pulled pork. I told the waitress they were going ot have some angry people if at 5PM before dinner time they were already out of pork. \n\nWe all agreed about the food, because we all tried each others. Mac & Cheese was the best I've ever had, black eyed peas were delicious, red beans amazing, fried cabbage was great! all of the sides were top notch. Our entrees were kind of average at best, though. Mom and I agreed the brisket was tough, chewy, and very poorly prepared. None of us enjoyed the pork ribs or the rib tips. The gristle/fat to meat ratio was probably 80/20. \n\nIt seems like they need to figure out how to prepare BBQ at this restaurant, because they have a lot of other dishes down pat. I'd go again but I'll try something different than BBQ... maybe a breakfast dish which I hear they are good at.
2	Went there with a couple of friends for dinner/beers on a Saturday night.  We were seated immediately, but it took 10 min for the waitress to visit our table.  After we ordered a round of beers, it was followed by another 10 min wait.  BTW, it wasn't very busy and there appeared to be plenty of wait staff.\n\nI ordered the house burger w/mac & cheese - it was good, but I've certainly had better at several places.  The consensus on the mac and cheese (which we tried because people raved about it) was it was average compared to other restaurants.\nOne friend ordered bacon wrapped shrimp - she said it was good, but wasn't happy with the serving size (5 shrimp).\nAnother friend ordered the tuna w/ a side of mac & cheese - he said the tuna was good, but they went overboard on the soy based sauce.\nWe shared the deviled eggs as an appetizer - no complaints here, liked the bacon garnish.\n\nMore on the wait staff - they seemed friendly, but possibly new.  Our waitress said she didn't see us and apologized for our initial wait (so it wasn't completely her fault...the hostess should have made sure she knew we were seated).  We overheard another waitress serving the tables nearby and she couldn't answer many of the questions that customers had (which is why I assumed she was new).\n\nPositives:  decent beer/wine selection, I liked the atmosphere (open air, bar & grill type of place)\n\nNegatives:  bad service, mediocre food, pricey dinner entrees, kind of a boring menu\n\nWill I go there again? - with as many restaurants as there are of this type, probably not.
4	I have just one complaint here...\n\nThe 'Native Puffs' appetizer was the 2nd worst app I ever had. A trail of sludge on the serving platter was very noticeable, as I slid the puff over to my dish.  But I didn't find any BP slush fund here to compensate my queasy stomach.  And the filling was comprised of nasty canned processed cheese.  The manager said he would give these to us at happy hour pricing, but that promise didn't make it to the check.\n\nNow on to the good stuff.  Their pizza rocked!  The crust was perfectly crisp, the sauce was seasoned to my taste, and the toppings were spot on.\n\nTheir wings were deep fried perfectly.  I just love the honey-hot flavor.\n\nOur server was very attentive (and his station was slammed), and the manager (and some other friendly employee) came over to check on us, telling us about an upcoming free wing special.  Even when one of the other server's bumped my arm as he walked by, he made a point to get my attention to apologize. (Results not typical)\n\nThey have $3.00 22oz domestic tap for happy hour.\n\nBoo Native Puffs.\nHooray Beer!\n\nPS. I agree with Richard.  Try Blue 32!
5	If you're in the mood for froyo, do yourself a favor and check this family business out.\n\nWe've been here a few times and have been greeted by friendly staff with little sample cups so we can try out a new flavor or two before filling up our bowls.  So far the caramel is the family favorite. I also noticed they had a flavor of yogurt that sported even fewer calories than regular frozen yogurt. I had to check it out and I thought it tasted great!  Of course, I ended up restoring the missing calories by spooning some chocolate bar goodness into my bowl...  It was worth it.\n\nThey've got a multitude of toppings and run special discounts on certain days. On one day they'll cut you a discount if you ride or bike to the store. I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nWe'll be back!
5	"""My masseuse delivered nothing short of perfection.\n\nBefore I even met her, I was cordially greeted at the front, a drink was offered, I was briefly assessed for my preferences, and then I was led to a \relaxation room.\""""\n\nThe masseuse came right on time and helped me to get situated on the therapeutic bed.  Although I managed to take everything off besides my skibbies in less than a minute, the masseuse knocked just as I tucked myself between the sheets on the bed.  So, it was appreciated that she didn't waste a second.\n\nThe massage was heavenly and the sheets were toasty.  She started with my back, then went to my hamstrings, calfs, feet, quads, chest, arms, hands, and head.  For the entire hour, she managed to maintain the degree of pressure that most built men could appreciate.  My main regret is that I didn't take down her name!\n\nBy the time I got to the counter to pay, I was in the state of euphoria that I hoped for - with a slight inability to keep my eyes open and comprehend even the most simple sentence.  So, folks, my mission was accomplished here and I suggest giving them a try if you are looking for a masseuse.  Enjoy!"""""""
5	"""Banana, i've always loved you, but I recently wrote a letter to corporate explaining why:\n\n\n\Hi,\nI wrote recently to say how I received horrible customer service from the Chandler store, Arizona (Chandler Mall) 2 days ago. According to the manager at Chandler, I was not able to return clothing that was worn, and also without the tags attached. However, they were not worn and I was explaining that I should be able to return my items since they were in good condition, were within the return time period, and with original receipt. The manager at this store said that I had 'obviously' worn it and that I needed to 'calm down and not make a scene' even though I was calm and respectful. She did not return it for me. She had a terrible attitude and it was the worst shopping experience.\n\nI went to the Scottsdale Fashion Center last night to try the Banana Republic store there, and talk about a totally different attitude there. The employee did not question my return or harass me about the condition of the clothing. (Especially because there was nothing wrong with them from the beginning). She immediately returned the items and apologized for the Chandler store experience even though it wasn't her fault. I told her how thankful I was that she didn't see anything wrong with what I was trying to do. I was impressed by her professionalism and caring attitude. She restored my view of Banana Republic customer service.\n\nI have been shopping at Banana Republic for many many years.\nThank you for having much more wonderful employees than the bad ones that ruin it for everyone.\n\nThank you,\nSandy\""""\n\n\n\nThis specific experience deserves a 5 star for alone... the fact that they saved themselves from my mornonic Chandler experience makes me want to come back."""""""
4	Thai Basil was a good addition to Park Central. this neglected mall is a ghost town at night. I'm sure Thai Basil can do  good business off the assorted Club Central crowd, as either a before or post happy hour eatery. Open till 9pm on Saturday is good for me too. \n\nthe Menu is typical Thai fare. the spring rolls i really enjoyed. they have yellow corn stuffed in side. i was quite surprised by it. I'm used to cabbage, clear rice noodles and various carrots, but CORN!! it was freaking delish. the dipping sauce was accompanied by a small salad.\n\ni ordered Red Currey (Medium Spice) it was very flavorful..but..medium?. i didn't notice any heat. not like in a mild. but like a missing heat. next time I'm going hot. and i pray they deliver the goods. i want scorching. tongue tingling action here.\n\nmy homegirl got Garlic Vegetable with chicken, (Mild) we both figured go weak on this one cause she's not a hot person. and if it was weak. toss on some chili sauce. so..yea chili sauce was added.  the flavors were on point. garlicky and full of taste. not often do you see green beans in Asian food. i think the playful touches add allot. \n\nlike David S.B. noticed in his review. Thai Elephant was much hotter. if these two restaurants are indeed related. i wonder why the flavor variations?? \nthe decor is also quite different. there was only one image on the wall. and it looked like a WW2 Era picture of a family member who was serving in the Thai Liberation army or something. (i just made that up)\nwhich is a juxtaposition of most Thai restaurants i have been to which have random Buddhist idols and what-nots. honestly i like the change up.\n\ntotal on the bill for two entrees and an order of spring rolls was 36.Change which is pretty good.\n\nif Thai Basil and Thai Elephant are related. i think they have little twists that make each place different. i look forward to returning.\n\n\nthere was a party of about 8-9 when we arrived, which at the time we got there. they were the only other people in the restaurant. so i think this place is good for groups...as of now. when this place picks up in popularity..i don't think it would be all that comfortable with a large group..inside. outside will be great. lots of ceiling fans to keep the area cool.

I've grown used to a world where my quick stop options are a hot dog or some cleverly named toquito, but this place has chicken strips slowly rotated over the grill in buffalo sauce, red hots, corn dogs, tomales, it's more than I can bear, but the best without question is the Jalapeno and cheese sausage roll. It's a symphony of delicious. Spicy, juicy, but with a tint of sweetness in the outer roll. And my toppings aren't limited to mustard, there is a much larger than averyage collection of toppings including some fancy mustards and seasonings. \n\nTheir drink selection includes everything including the elusive \Purple Stuff\"""" and their frozen drink selection includes blue raspberry.

4	If you haven't been to the Cornish Pasty (pronounced past-tee), you have not really seen the heart of Tempe. It's a little place, not really good for groups or kiddos, but when you enter you truly fee the atmosphere shift, and guess what? Now you're part of the cool crowd. The food is so good! I love their mushy peas for a starter (although half of the time they are out) and then the Pilgrim to seal the deal. It's like a Thanksgiving party in your mouth any time of the year! All of their food is great, and this place is always busy it seems. Don't come on a Friday or Saturday night unless you like being in small spaces with a million loud drunks. Mid-afternoon is the best. The servers are usually pleasant, but some have a better-than-you hipster attitude. But hey, if you haven't been here yet, you're missing out on Tempe's best kept secret!
4	Today I fell in love.. The Parlor is what I love...all things fresh...in a clean little enclave on Camelback.. The waiter was friendly.. as my friend and I wanted to know about the meat/cheese selection on the app menu.. It just wasnt a real clear thing to us! Call me blonde or???? Nonetheless.. he recommended a few things.. all the while smiling and friendly.. We opted for the meat/cheese app before our salads.. choosing proscuitto, dried salami.. goat cheese and a sheeps milk cheese.. it comes with a warm garlicky buttery sensational flatbread and two sauces.. one is a tomatoe type jam.. the other a pesto.. highly recommend this app! NOW my one suggestion is to add more selection to the cheeses.. I lived in France.. I love a good cheese board! Watering of the tastebuds as I remember ... \nSalads.. I had the harvest greens.. roasted, shredded chicken, pears, candied pecans.. gorganzola.. yum! My friend opted for the norm Caesar.. but it looked divine.. \nDecor is cute.. trendy..clean.. Im going back for pizza and wine on date night and hanging on the patio near that fireplace:-)

My BFF and I spent the weekend there to celebrate our bdays and the must have overheard us talking about it because they sent wine to our room that same night!  \n\nAnd... talk about the spa!

5	What to do on a 110+ degree day in Mesa? Salt River Tubing!! I came here with my future roommate and it was a wonderful way to bond! We drove up here grabbed some tubes and floated away on the river!\n\nOne time the river started going too fast and these rocks ended up hitting my legs! Definitely got some bruises. What would have been better is to link the tubes together and wear sandals (I ended up borrowing my roommate's to steer and paddle to avoid rocks). It was incredibly fun none the less!\n\nTip: Bring String and sheets to link your tubes together. Wear sandals. Bring sunglasses and a hat (that you don't mind flying away). Also! Bring a cooler with refreshing drinks!
4	Taco Bell must offer some of the cheapest calories in America. At this TB cheap calories come with great service.\n\nRare for an American fast food restaurant, I have never experienced a single episode of bad service at this TB. Whether it's the friendly girl who upgrades my nachos (gratis) to the next size or the incredibly animated man who also works the snack counter at the AZ Center AMC, this TB's employees have one thing in common: they aim to please.\n\nThe food, of course, is nothing exceptional. It's TB. It fills you up and, at this location, it has consistently filled me up without causing food poisoning. When you're talking TB, what more could you ask for?
4	I seriously love me some Carlsbad!  I love that happy hour and those delicious margaritas and those yummy potstickers... I think my stomach just growled!  The potstickers are chicken and sauteed in a soy-like sauce and served with a sweet creamy corn sauce on the side of the plate... It's fantastically salty, sweet and savory.  They also do a pretty tasty sopapilla. \nThe inside is a bit dark, but its a cave right?  And they have a killer patio with water falls when its not blazing hot outside.  \nNote: I hear their lobster enchiladas are killer (though i don't eat seafood) and the Habanero burger got Food Network magazine's best burger in AZ!
2	The two stars are for the food. We shared a bleu cheese burger and the wedge salad along with the potato chip appetizer.  While I do think it would be difficult to mess up said items, they were very good.  Then again, perhaps it was only the depth of my hunger pangs that had me thinking so....\n\nWe dined on a Friday night before a Suns game a couple weeks ago. Since it was a busy day and time, we gave ourselves ample time to enjoy our meal.  What lured me into Copper Blues was its upstairs location which provided a beautiful view and the live music seeping out the open windows of the patio.  This place looked like the perfect spot for a beer and a burger on that mild January evening. And if the service weren't so poor, it would be. \n\nWhen we arrived at Copper Blues, there was one couple in front of us at the hostess stand and a large sign that said 'Please Wait to be Seated'.  We obliged.  We waited and waited.  There was not a host in sight so finally the couple in front of us flagged a server down who promptly sat them.  By this time, there were a few more parties in line behind us.  The server, having seen the line that had formed, I assumed would alert the necessary staff and/or return to seat the rest of us still there waiting, but she did not.  Again, we waited.  Five more minutes went by until finally, we flagged down security and he sat us- at a dirty table.  It was quickly cleaned and a smiley and sweet server approached us within a few minutes and asked for our drink order.  \n\nWe ordered a beer and 2 waters.  We got the beer, about five minutes later, and only one water.  We elected to share it and not complain.  We ordered another beer and the appetizer- potato chips and an onion and sour cream dipping sauce.  She returned about 10 minutes later with the beer and we put in our burger and salad.  Then, we did what I was beginning to see was a theme at Copper Blues- we waited.  The appetizer, which was an item that did not need to even be cooked, took 30 minutes. Then, a full hour after placing our order, our burger came out- with chips instead of fries.  We accepted it anyway and did not complain.  The salad had been forgotten but she assured us it could be out quickly.  The sweet server apologized once more. It was 10 minutes till tip off now.  We hurried through our meal and left just in time to miss only a minute or two of the game. Phew.\n\nWhen we attended the Suns game the next Friday night, we went to Tilted Kilt instead.  There was not an unrealistic wait for the food and we didn't miss a minute of the game.
4	We came here for a happy hour and I definitely left happy.\nI had sweet tea vodka and lemonade cocktails at $4 each.  A very nice price for the tall drink.\nWe also tried the chicken wings and spinach dip.  Both tasty.  The wings were so good.  Lollipop style with the right amount of spice.\nThe interior was open with high ceilings and an industrial feel.  The staff were all friendly.  I would like to go back and try some of their entrees.
2	We visited this past weekend.  We have our favorite places in the East Valley but after reading the reviews for Down Under Wines & Bistro, we decided to give it a try (plus we love to support local businesses).   Sadly, we were underwhelmed and confused by the place.  The location used to be a Baja Fresh and unfortunately, it still looks like it.  Throwing in a couple of wine barrel tables and faux painting the old Baja Fresh tiles red, does not a wine bar make.     The place is dark, the tables and chairs are uncomfortable and the drop ceiling (which is in disrepair) just made us confused and a little grossed out.  Like others have mentioned the service was painfully slow, not that the servers were inattentive (they were very friendly), but clearly, the kitchen needs more help.   There were 2 other tables that ordered food and our order took well over 30 minutes.  What did we order? The olive trio (three kinds of jarred olives-NOT what we expected) the ribs (which were good) and the bruschetta ($10 for 4 pieces and way over priced and lacked any of the flavor of other favorites from Postino, Living Room or D-Vine.)  We ordered the house red wine which was ok...thankfully it was only $5.    Unfortunately, I have to say, don't bother!
4	So I met a friend there for dinner last night and the joint was jumpin'!  i was absolutely floored by the tomato soup...OMG, it was just delicious!  I also had the sesame tuna for my main course...it was only OK, cooked too much for my taste.  It's a cute place and the staff is really well trained so that was really a nice treat.  I don't know if I will make this a regular since it's so far away but it has potential.  NOW, if they had a good happy hour, it might become a stop.  Just sayin'
4	I had a blast at Skeptical Chymist last night... Thanks again to the yelpers that came out for trivia - Although 'Team Yelp Yourself' didn't win any major prizes, we sure had fun!  \n\nI love the atmosphere at SC - so laid back and the staff is friendly as can be!  I wasn't sure I'd be able to find a light bite to eat (I was expecting heavy Irish bar food), but I was pleasantly surprised and I really enjoyed my house salad with salmon. I sampled the curry fries from Kelly B and dare I say they were the best I've had?!  I would go back just for those!  Delicious!  Both items went well with the Strongbow apple cider too. Thanks again, Jolene (my waitress) for your recommendations!\n\nI look forward to checking out live music at Skeptical Chymist another time soon... or perhaps returning once I brush up on my trivia knowledge.  Either way, I'll be back for sure!
1	"""Rude! The man working here today had no interest in my business. I simply wanted to ship some documents, but instead of outlining options or helping me he just pointed at a display of envelopes and said I had to buy those first. When I grabbed a single express envelope he just said I couldn't use that instead of explaining that I could use that to ship express. When I said i would go to a UPS store instead he just said \yeah\"""" and walked away. Horrible customer service- I won't be back to this location!"""""""
4	Sand in a bar in the AZ? While I thought this was too good to be true when the north Scottsdale bar first opened a few years back, I soon found out it wasn't and Sandbar has become one of my favorite Scottsdale bars. \n\nThe beach bar features a sand-covered patio, private patio cabanas, an ample margarita menu, delicious Mexican eats and a small pool. The restaurant and bar is decorated with bright decor and the dance floor is a hot spot on the weekends.\n\nNow if only they would add an ocean!
4	Went there with the family for Father's Day and will definitely go back again (just not with the family).  I ordered the Combination Pho.  Now it's been years since I had eaten Pho as there were no Vietnamese places near me.  I don't remember exactly how the Pho tasted at Da Vang years ago, but I know it was better than here.  But Siagon Kitchen's Pho was still excellent.  The meatballs are very tasty and the broth has a unique sweetness to it.  I would definitely eat this dish again.  My wife had a combination rice plate that was very good as well.  The biggest surprise was the chicken sandwiches that the kids got.  They did not like them (why I won't go with the family again), but I had them for leftover lunches for the next three days.  At $5 these are an absolute steal.  They are tasty with grilled chicken, diakons (a radish type veggie), cucumbers, carrots and cilantro.  These would be perfect to pop in and have for lunch.
1	"""It takes a lot for me to write a negative review.\nI decided to stop here for a quick Wednesday night dinner. It was busy, but not a friday night busy sort of evening.\nWe opted to sit out on the patio-once we were seated, is where my experience at Half Moon went sour. We sat there for at least 10 min before someone came to take our drink order. Our waitress disappeared, and it took another 15 min for her to reappear with our drinks. I'm annoyed at this point..25 min just to get my drinks and you havn't even taken my order?!\nIn that time..about 3 other tables fill on that patio..those same 3 people get up and walk out because of the lack of service.\nOur appetizer finally arrive i(we've now been there for 45 min), and I say \I was wondering if we were forgotten\"""", and the food runner then decides to YELL AT ME. Yes, me, the customer. The customer who has been waiting close to an HOUR for a sandwich and a soda.\nHe screams at me, and I quote, \""""LOOK-the upper floor is packed, and we can cook only so much at a time\""""...and storms off.\nWhat just happened here?! Did that employee seriously yell at me and try to school me on the workings of a restaurant?! \nWe had been sitting there for so long that by the time we would have left, we would have been stuck waiting elsewhere anyway.\nI couldnt believe the complete lack of service, courtesy, and the outright  rude employee, who needs a serious training course on customer service.\nWe ate our meal..chuckled at how insane it all was..the 'upper deck' is a 2 step elevated section inside so we had a good laugh at that too.\nTo top off the miserable experience, the food was below mediocre Over cooked, the cole slaw was awful, and we kissed any chance of our drinks being refreshed goodbye. It was like we were the exiles on a deserted island begging for a beverage. \nHalf Moon will never see my hard earned pennies again. I'd rather run down the street to Sonic!!!!"""""""
3	I'm working in Phoenix this week with another company guy, so we both looked on Yelp! and settled on Firebirds - a well rated restaurant in the Chandler Fashion District, close to the office we are working at.  On entering (early evening), we were greeted with a lovely smoky smell that tantalized.  Seating was immediate by a friendly hostess.\n\nThe restaurant has a relatively dark interior similar to many other steak houses.  I could hear the music, but it sounded like it was coming from another room.  They could have piped it in to the main room quietly so that it didn't have the distant echoy effect.\n\nMy dining companion ordered a strawberry lemonade that was served in a pint glass with a sugared rim.  There were slices of fruit inside and froth on top - evidence of its fresh taste.  I, as usual, ordered coffee and that was much more bitter than I like.  Dark roasts that have been left to heat too long always taste the same, and it isn't good.\n\nSince so many people liked the crab cakes, we ordered those for an appetizer.  To my mind, they had too much of a strong celery taste.  The spicy marmalade sauce that they came with complemented the crab cakes excellently.  The slaw had crispy tortilla strips in it and a nice light dressing - very tasty.\n\nOur ceasar salads arrived.  The usual romaine lettuce was well dressed and augmented by in-house made croutons (the bread also being baked in-house) and nice slices of parmesan cheese.  Unfortunately, the parmesan was the only salt component, so the salad was fairly flat.\n\nI ordered the Durango burger - a chile spiced affair with pepper jack cheese, fried onions and roasted garlic ranch dressing.  Unfortunately, despite the tantalizing smell when we entered the restaurant, there was no smokiness on the burger.  Nor was there any spice.  They grind the meat in-house, so the medium rare burger had a good texture ans taste to it.  However I wanted punch, and got none.\n\nMy dining companion ordered the smoke house burger with bbq sauce, applewood smoked bacon and grated cheddar cheese.  There was too much bbq sauce included, and the cheddar cheese was not melted.  The bacon was the highlight here.  He also had fries (whereas I opted to replace the fries with my salad).  The portion size on the fries could only be described as small, and the fries were left behind as unappetizing.\n\nOverall, an average place.  It's certainly a place I will go to again, but I'm likely to try other offerings in the area before I choose to go back.
4	"""I used to go to the 7th st location until it closed, while I find that to be a TOTAL bummer (bartender had a heavy hand & there were lots of the regular servers)  I do very much enjoy the salsa at this location better.  It is chunkier and fresher tasting.  I feel like the enchiladas are a bit smaller at this location and they don't use quite as much spice on their machaca, but regardelss the food here is good.  Yes, it is \Americanized\"""" but 90% of the places in az are, its all good.. you just have to find the tasty \""""Americanized\"""" mexican food places and Manuels happens to be one of them.  The hostess is always personable, which is great and makes a nice first impression.  Service is hit and miss, but the food is good and the price is right."""""""
4	I am totally obsessed with Souvia Tea.  They have such a wide variety of tea's its absolutly impossible to choose without consulting the staff, and they are happy to share opinions!  \n\n2 things I wish would happen: create better ambiance....ie love seats etc.  Its in a tiny little spot which helps to make it a little cozier but the seating arrangement is more study worthy than relaxing.  Also, the hours kinda stink.  Ok, maybe I just have my tea cravings at odd times of the day, but they almost always happen after 7pm!!!  I need a little calorie free dessert here people.  And closed Sunday = big :(  Its my only day off from work! \n\nStill, 5 stars for Souvia Tea, excellant selection, helpful friendly staff and extremely tasty!!
4	The 25th review of Mary Coyle's. This is the definitive review.\n\nFirst, MC is NOT hip, cool. urban or pretentious. It IS a Phoenix institution, much like Durants, and you enter through the back. It smells cloyingly sweet when you walk in. It's never even been exactly in a neighborhood either. Formerly on the edge of Encanto, now on the edge of Rancho Solano. Durants is not gourmet food and this is not gourmet ice cream folks. I think it is still  a family business too.\n\nI have always lived near a Mary Coyle, so it's not a special trip for me. I would not make a trip to Sugar Bowl, but it's nice to drop in when I'm in the 'hood.\n\nMary Coyle is a traditional ice cream parlor with home made ice cream offered in many flavors, but more important, offered in many styles. Don't go in to order a single scoop. You must order a sundae or a banana split or float or some other concoction. Go to savor the blend of layers, the decadence of it all, the freedom of choice (chocolate, caramel, strawberry syrup?).This is a splurge, loosen your belt.\n\nI don't believe the drive thru has ever been open and I've driven by many, many times. The lunch food is pretty good; remember, not gourmet. I've had the chicken salad, tuna and egg salad. My kids have had grilled cheese.\n\nMary Coyle is fun. It is a family place, kids (t-ball to adult) meet after a game, a date place, anyone with a fun attitude can enjoy a trip to Mary Coyle. \n\nHint: Since dairy-intolerance hit, I've ordered a banana split without the ice cream. So to all of you who hate to waist (oops, waste) those calories, maybe you do have options. But really, if you insist on always watching what you eat, don't blame Mary Coyle. Go to your favorite frozen yogurt or gelato spot and order your single scoop.\n\nPhoenix needs Mary Coyle. It's a happy place and time before we grew up and had worries.
4	I like working out here.  I go to school right next door, so it's easy to stay a little later after my day is over to work out.  At first I didn't like that I would see my schoolmates and it felt awkward, but after going several times and feeling like a regular I'm happy to see people and say hi to them.  I guess it was just a confidence thing.\n\nI like using the machines - make sure you are engaging the muscles the machine is meant for, engage your abs, and keep your back straight.\n\nClasses are fun!  I tried Zumba and Boot camp and got a lot out of both of them!  As with all gyms, some teachers are better than others so try multiple times that work in your schedule find your favorite!
5	I wish I could give this place 6 stars. \n\nWe purchased the Groupon and went on the same night to unPhogettable.  By 6PM, this place was boomin. \n\n We ordered the soft summer rolls (pork sausage), #8 (Pho with brisket and flank) and the #48 (steamed rice with seasoned grilled sliced beef). \n\nThe summer rolls were very good and came with a delish house sauce.  We hadn't received our dinners yet when a server came over and asked if we had the Groupon.  We said yes, and she explained that they couldn't accept it until the next day.  We hadn't read that on the deal, so I was a little frustrated (not mad, but just like, 'dangit!').  The owner stopped by and we talked to him for a few minutes.  We looked at our Groupon and saw that it DID say it couldn't be used until the next day.  So it was totally our over-sight. \n\n He explained that a few tables had gotten mad and walked out, and they only did the Groupon to get new people to try their restaurant since June is the quietest month for most restaurants in the valley.  We told him that we didn't care about the Groupon, and were there for the food not the deal.  We decided we would just use the Groupon the next weekend. \n\nNeedless to say, he was very excited and grateful. I think we were more excited about our dinners though.  \n\nWhen our meals came out, he showed us the Vietnamese way to eat Pho and the rice and meat plate.  That was really cool.  It was obvious that he took great pride in his restaurant and food, and wanted to make sure everyone was happy. \n\nI can't explain how amazing the food was. The #48 came with a broth on the side that you eat first to cleanse your palate.  I could have just eaten that as my meal and been totally satisfied.  The sauce on the beef was hard to explain.  It was slightly sweet, but had a lot of depth.  I was reluctant to share. \n\nThe Pho broth was fantastic.  After all of the noodles, meat and bean sprouts were gone, and we were both stuffed, I couldn't stop sipping the broth.  Seriously. It was so good, I didn't mind over-stuffing myself. \n\nWe said we would be back next weekend.  I don't think I can wait that long.
1	I wouldn't eat here if I was a pot bellied pig coming from a diet center.  \n\nThe last time I was in town, I got a rack with a mac n cheese and bbq beans for sides.  0-3, that's right, they are batting .000.   The ribs were drier than the Phoenix desert, tougher than an off-road tire and cost more than Paris Hilton's lip waxing.  The mac n cheese was the most bland, pale, crappy side I think I ever had.  The bbq beans tasted like the cooks (ha) poured liquid smoke in the beans and then left them to cook for 20 days.\n\nI wouldn't wipe my a$$ with this place.  And expensive too!!!\n\nAnyone that thinks this is good BBQ has never had good BBQ.  Anyone that thinks this is good food must be of Irish or English decent.\n\nThis one just may make it on my all-time haters list.  That's right Cold Stone, you now have company in the shitter.\n\nYa feel me?
4	SanTan Brewing has become a regular destination for me in the East Valley, and even more so since moving to Gilbert. I've been coming here for about a year now. SanTan is a fantastic micro brewery the occupies an old bank in downtown Chandler. Anthony, the brewmaster, knows his craft and is creating some delicious beers. \n\nNot to compare, or even pick on Four Peaks, because I love their beer but I think SanTan is where the grownups go to drink craft beer. Compared to Four Peaks, SanTan doesn't have the rowdy college crowd downing pitchers of beer and stumbling back to their dorm rooms. SanTan has a crowd that goes to meet up after work, a fun night out with friends, or a place to hang out and watch the game... all while enjoying some of the best beer in Arizona. \n\nThe staff at SanTan is great. Even after only our second or third time in the bartenders recognized us and began to know our beers. Cory, Amanda and Hailey are regular bartenders that are always there serving up great beer. They're attentive and very quick! We noticed this one Wednesday night, there were three or four behind the bar and the pub was packed. It was great to see all of them in sync and bustling about. All of them knew exactly what they were doing and moving around each other in a manner that was fun to watch. Even with them being so busy they were constantly checking on their patrons at the bar. Nice job guys!\n\nFor a micro brewery I don't have super high expectations for food, but I am constantly pleased. Their bar snacks such as nachos, soft pretzels, sliders, etc. are all very good and are a step up from typical bar food. Likewise, their fish & chips are great! Their happy hour is also very good. A 20oz glass of ice cold craft beer will only set you back $3.75! \n\nI don't think I've tried a SanTan beer I didn't like. Their flagship beer, Devil's Ale, was rated 96 points from Draft Magazine. That's great! Devil's Ale is an American Pale Ale with great floral notes and just the right amount of hops to keep the beer crisp and clean. Their IPA, Hopshock, is a very dry and hopping IPA, but delicious as well. The Epicenter, Amber Ale, is what I would call a gateway beer. For those that are used to drinking cheap light beer, this a good seg-way into a craft beer. It might be a little dark and intimidating in color, but it's rich amber color is matched by a rich malt flavor that is incredibly smooth. I am a huge fan of trying their seasonal brews as well. Just ask them to sample whatever seasonal is on tap, and I can almost guarantee you will not be disappointed.
3	I hate to do this, because I like APF a lot, but I have to knock them down a star.  My last visit, the bread was weird (see: not crunchy).  Today for lunch, the bread for my panini still seemed off, doughy, and not much flavor.  They also seemed to have changed their simple pasta salad - it used to be olive oil / dijon mustard-based, but the mustard is no longer there.  \n\nAnother reason is the price - quite simply, they've gone up almost 50% since I started going there four years ago, making it a questionable value at lunch.  I will continue to go, but I have to give my honest assessment.  \n\nThe croissants are still fantastic.
3	"""One word comes to mind: overpriced. Then again, I'm no fish expert and can't really fathom why a pasta dish would reach $30 or why their appetizers can be $12. \n\nThe prices for oysters are reasonable. The ones I had just weren't shucked properly. Every one I slurped came with an unexpected piece of shell. It was really a bummer. This place does have a helluva lot of sauces to choose from, though, if you're adventurous. \n\nTheir Happy Hour menu isn't anything impressive. Not at all. Yucky American beer, like Bud, counts toward the $3.25 pint. Nothing else does. They do have a great Honey Ale and also offer Moose Drool here, as well as Orion, the best Japanese beer you'll find. And it costs $7.50 for the 22 oz, whereas you'll pay $9.00 for the same at Kabuki.\n\nThey also have a short sushi menu. It's not too impressive, but it's enough to pique your interest. I really loved their Rainbow Roll. \n\nMaybe it's b/c we sat at the bar, but we barely got any service. And it began to annoy me. We had to ask for water. We had to ask to order. We had to ask for another 'round. We had to ask for soy sauce trays. We had to ask for just about everything, in fact. \n\nThe atmosphere is ordinary - what you might expect from a place called a \Fish House.\"""" Nothing really stood out to me. \n\nWould I be back? Uhm, maybe, since they do have a couple good beers available, they serve fresh fish and they have a pretty wide selection of oysters to pick from... I just hope next time they're shucked properly. \n\nI would like to try their King Crab/Shrimp appetizer. It was served to the gentleman beside us. It sounded good on the menu. It looked even better in person. \n\nAll in all, an okay place. But again, I think it's overpriced. You can easily walk out of there having spent $40 on a beer, a sushi roll and oysters."""""""
5	Finally went to Golden Spoon last night... it lived up to the hype! \n\nThe flavors I got were cake batter and strawberry (yes, they let you do a two flavors, for no additional cost!) and they were delish! I ordered the small size, and was unable to finish it - so you really do get a lot for your money.\n\nThe service was great, and they let us sample as many different flavors as we liked, and even gave some great suggestions of combos. We'll definitely be going back :)
1	I can't stand the way everyone hyped this place up when it first opened. It's way too overpriced for the cheap, lifeless ingredients they use. The food they serve here is similar to something you can buy ready-to-eat in a bag from a grocery store. Like the salad for example, they give you this huge mound of iceberg mix. Okay, I could have purchased this at the store, thrown it on a plate, and for half the price! Trendy decor isn't the only thing you need these days to run a restaurant, people!
5	This place is AWESOME!  I usually go there for late breakfast around 10:30 or 11 after working in the morning.  The wait at that time is not that bad but I can imagine the long line in the morning.  \n\nWell every time I go to Phoenix for business, I come here for breakfast.  The OJ is AMAZING!  The waffle is AMZING!  And the staff is AMZAING!\n\nIf in doubt, just look at the pictures.  Viewing them made me want to have an excuse to go to Phoenix again just to eat.  My mouth is still watering as I am writing this.\n\nYou MUST try this place.
3	"""I like the review of the whacked waiter... i think he may be still at work at 'Cantina Laredo' cuz i think he served us....... \n\nCalled ahead after a Cardinals game to make sure there was room enough for our party of 10- \n\ No problem \"""" we were told , come on down. \n\narrived 9:00 ish on a beautiful 80F evening in Scottsdale -stepped across a half empty patio into the spacious Cantina - chilled to an ungodly 60F- \n\nNote to the great state of Arizona : \n\n(the reason that y'all are booming and experiencing sustained in-migration is because people are like lizards--- ( in more ways than one)---they like the sun , they like the heat ... they flee from northern climes to get away from the chill - Don't AC your premises such that it reminds us of Duluth in winter.... we just escaped Duluth in winter and fled south to thaw ) .\n\nwe asked for a spot on the patio and our man immediately declined stating that \"""" he had already set a table for us inside\""""- \n\nupon my wife's insistence that he reevaluatethe patio  he disappeared for a moment or two and then reappeared - affirming that the half empty patio was indeed full. \n\nthis puzzled my wife who then surmised that : \n\nA) he wanted our large party in his section -not the patio\n\nB) there would likely be a built in minimum gratuity on the final bill \n                                      ( there was) \n                 \nafter taking our drink order ,(competently),  he returned with salsa and chips.

If people want spice they go Mexican - if they want bland they seek out a Saskatchewan restaurant - non? \n\nThe meal was salvaged - ( not saved), by a compatriot of our man who hailed from Durango- he spoke knowledgeably about the menu , filled our empty margarita glasses and retreated into the kitchen to assemble , on our behalf , a pepper mole sauce that was truely outstanding.\n\nThe food was uninspired -( there was a Baja Grill of some sort across the parking lot and we wondered if they shared a kitchen...) , the service was poor ( excepting our hombre from Mejico ), and the casa freakishly cold--\n\nTwo stars tops over all but boosted up to three by our amigo from Victoria de Durango"""""""
2	"""Juan Jaime's is just kinda \bleh\"""". Not gross, but not anything memorable. I agree with other reviewers... it is crappy that you have to pay for chips and salsa and then have to go get your own salsa, none of which are anything to write home about.  The food is fresh, but it is also pretty flavorless. I thought it might've been healthy Mexican food, but turns out that isn't their angle. Basically, I used to eat here because I worked across the street and it was a better option than fast food (also was totally dead at lunchtime so no wait), but now that I don't work there I can't imagine that I would ever feel the need to eat at Juan Jaime's again."""""""
4	"""Sub Factory is a nice little sub shop located near the 101 and University. I say it's little, however you could probably see their neon sign from space; it is gigantic. Also, it has a two story dining area, however the mythical second floor has never been seen open. One day I hope to venture up there just to see what it's like. Til then I'll just have to dream. \n\nThe subs are good and decently priced. They lightly toast the bread and have thin sliced deli meats, both great things in my opinion. I usually get the club sandwich. Love it. They have a great variety though. For those who want to keep things cheap they have the \Lil Abner\"""" which is a turkey sub around $2.49 or so. They have some tables and booths to sit at if you choose to dine in. It is very much a \""""local joint\"""" in my opinion, although there are a few other Sub Factories around the valley. The staff is always friendly as well as quick to get your food out. \n\nIt gets busy at lunch but take my advice and call your order in ahead of time. They take phone orders and that way you can just grab it and go. It's also right next to a Tattoo parlor, so if you like your sandwich enough feel free to get \""""Sub Factory\"""" tattooed on your chest or something.\n\nIf you haven't tried it, check it out. It is definitely a nice alternative if you are tired of Subway and that awful foot long song."""""""
4	I live much closer to The Arcadia Vig, but met up with a friend at The Vig Uptown this morning for brunch. The decor at Uptown is amazing... the windows alone had me drooling. I had to wipe up the drool to partake of my delicious breakfast: The Hangover Helper with the $3 Vigazz Bloody Mary. The bloody mary wasn't the best I'd ever had (even though it was rated high in Best of Phoenix) but the Hangover Helper was possibly the best brunch item that I have ever tasted. Worth it for that alone.
5	I am so glad to have rediscovered Sahara at its new location! I've been on a quest to discover the best hummus in Phoenix and when this place closed at its old location, I was sure that the best stuff was gone forever! But it's back, still run by it's original Iraqi owner, and just as delicious as before. The tahini-rich hummus and babganoush are the best around and the grape leaves are stuffed with saffron rice and lots of herbs and spices. My favorite thing to do it order a couple of lemonades, the vegetarian platter, and one of the pits sandwiches (the kuku is pretty tasty) and share it all with a friend. The baklava isn't bad either. Oh, and it's cheap!
4	I love this asian style spa. The owner has an unbelievable memory.  I hadn't been there in over 6 months and when I went back he asked me how my grandma's kidney is doing. I couldn't believe he remembered. that detail.\n\nIt's very clean and has impeccable decor. \nAlso, they are fast and efficient. I got a manicure, pedicure and wax in 60 minutes flat. They do your mani/pedi at the same time on the pedestal style massage spa chairs.\n\nI love the hot towel they use on my legs and feet after each pedicure.\nThe wax is never too hot like some other salons I have tried. \n\n The manicurist's are very friendly and gave me a awesome sculptured nail using white powder for the french portion of my nail instead of white polish.\n\nI definitely recommend Perfect Nails & Spa.
5	This is the nicest city pool in the whole east valley. It is more like a small water park. A huge lap pool, a seperate pool with a large kiddie play area, 2 water slides, spray pad, whirlpool, lazy river. Cheap fun for the whole family. Hours vary so go to their website for summer hours. They do get VERY busy in the summer and are often to capacity by 1pm so go when they open, or later in the afternoon around 2 or 3 and you should be fine.
4	"""I can honestly say that I don't remember too much about the food, but the experience. Now that's a whole 'nother story. \n\nPicture this... I'm in Phoenix on a business trip at the Best Western HQ. So the owner of my company says that she heard about this restaurant that has a slide and she wants to try it out. Hmmm. A restaurant with a slide? Boss is paying. Hey, I'm coming, let me get my purse (for decoration only tonight). \n\nWell, after we driver to the end of the universe, we finally arrive. There are three in our party, including my crazy BGF co-worker. For those of you in the hotel biz, he's a night auditor, 'nuff said, you get the picture. \n\nOnce we are seated (and the view is spectacular), we peruse the menu (oh, I ix nayed the slide. After seeing a heavy set lady with a dress on slide down and leave her booty juice.... again, nuff said). We looked over the menu and boss lady decides that we should try the fried rattlesnake and the Cowboy Platter. I'm game, remember, she's paying. \n\nFried rattlesnake. What the he!! was I thinking? Must have been that quart sized drink I inhaled (remember, she's paying). Ok, what does it taste like? Popcorn chicken from KFC, over cooked. Again, nuff said. \n\nWe're discussing the merits of Fried rattlesnake (that darn drink again) when we hear a commotion. Running across the restaurant like the kitchen is on fire, come 3 waiters. One has a triangle and is screaming at the top of their lungs. And the other two have this massive metal platter between them, held above their heads. They are all screaming and heading for us. I'm looking like an intoxicated (drink, boss, paying) deer in headlights as my auditory system catches up and sends the signal to my brain. \COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL, COWBOY SPECIAL\"""" \n\nOh great, now everyone in the restaurant is looking at our eclectic little group. My little Asian boss, dressed in flowers from head to toe with her $350 pumps, my BGF who is about 6\""""5, 400# and bald as an egg, and me, the fully intoxicated (Drink, Boss, Free) Korean American in her business suit. \n\nThis platter had like 1/2 a cow, a chicken family and the 3 little pigs on it. I couldn't even begin to do it justice. It should have come with a warning. DO not eat for a week before ordering this special. Needless to say, I had an elephant bag to take with me after dinner (too much for a mere doggie). \n\nOh and the piece de resistance? Why my boss convinced me (Booze. Free. Boss) that the free country line dancing on the patio for everyone to see would be just the thing. WRONG! No rhythm when I'm sober, so you know how this looked. Two left feet when I'm not drinking. You get the picture? One last time.....Drink. Free. Boss. \""""Nuff Said!"""""""
3	a stylist named TERESA works here and she was lovely! she really paid attention to what i was looking for and took her time styling it so i would love the finished product, and i did. if you go to this salon, book with her.\n\non the other hand----as soon as i walked into this salon, i got a splitting headache from the fumes. the fumes from the nail stations were so strong that my eyes were burning at bit. i got used to it, but this salon is in desperate need of a better ventilation system. my headache was sharp, strong, and lasted the duration of the appointment. that part was horrible. teresa though was the saving grace and she did an excellent, excellent job.
4	My Father in Law always says that going to TC Eggington's is like being on vacation, and he is so right!\n\nIt is a bright, sunny restaurant with a little bit of outdoor seating, however I always prefer to sit inside for either the airconditioning or heat, depending on the time of year. The decor in the restaurant is preppy-country, with chicken wire accents (ie. in the menu covers), Country-style tables and chairs, llight colors, lots of windows, and flowers on each table. \n\nThe servers are typically very good - they tend to be young, clean cut, and well spoken. They all dress in pastel polo shirts, khaki shorts, and loafers, which lends to the resort/Country Club feel of the place. There is an older gentleman who is usually at the front desk; I believe he is the manager or owner. He is often friendly but has also been a bit rude on occasion - try to let this slide if you can as the rest of the restaurant is so worth it! \n\nThe food is great - I really haven't anything that I did not like, although there are definitely some favorites! My favorite dish at TC's is the Au Pear Grenache Omelet - a delicious omelet filled and topped with bacon, almonds, fresh slices of pear, and gruyere cheese. It is a nice savory omelet with a hint of sweetness from the pears. The crunch of the almonds keeps it interesting and it is SO GOOD. It is served with breakfast potatoes (a nice complement to the texture of the omelet) and a house-made English muffin. The English Muffin is a great way to finish - they have yummy apple-cinnamon preserves on every table. \n\nMy husband's favorite dish is a lunch item: the Natie Bomb Sandwich. It is a turkey sandwich served on 12 grain bread with bacon, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and APPLE (yum!) with a sundried tomato sauce. It usually comes with a cold pasta salad, but I recommend going with an alternate side as the pasta salad isn't all that great. \n\nThe pancakes, fritatta, etc are all delicious as well! I highly recommend TC Eggingtons for a nice, vacationy breakfast.\n\nOH! And the best thing: They take reservations. They are usually super busy for brunch on the weekends and you can wait 30 minutes + for a table, but if you know you want to dine with them ahead of time, make a reservation and everything is so much easier. I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes whenever I make a reservation ahead of time.
5	Came in here for a post half-marathon meal with a couple of friends. They told me that since it was a Sunday, we had to go to Yupha's since Yupha had great Sunday Specials [or great lunch specials in general].\n\nOne of the perks of having gone the day that we did was that their soup and their salad for lunch were all you can you eat [or at least they didn't hint at any restrictions - I still only went for one round]. What was great about the salad is their peanut sauce/dressing - SOOOO DELICIOUS!!\n\nI got their chicken red curry, one friend got their chicken green curry, and another got their duck red curry. All of the dishes were of generous portions and extremely flavorful. The texture in the chicken was not tough and not overdone as it often can be in curries. There were ample ingredients in the curry to complement the rice. I was extremely satisfied with my selection, and from the looks of the empty plates from my friends, they were extremely happy with their selections as well.\n\nThe service was really nice, although one of the servers were not as proficient in his English and misunderstood a few of the things that were said. The staff all made us feel very welcome, making this place an absolute consideration to dine at the next time I'm in the area [I'm from Cali..]\n\nIf you want ample portions, good flavor, good pricing, and a friendly service, Yupha will NOT disappoint.
5	A friend of mine turned me on to Baker's in the past couple years as I became more involved with raised bed gardening. WOW. This place is huuuge and has nearly everything!! From seeds to trees, pots, yard art, water features, tools, supplements, and even bulk compost they'll front load into your pickup! Great selection of vegetables - organic & non and a friendly knowledgeable staff that is eager to help you find what you need and answer any questions u might have. I must say that the veggies I get from here seem far healthier and grow/produce faster and taste better than any other nursery or depot I've got plants from in the past. Lots of different varieties you won't find other places too :) Their ornamental plant selection is just as abundant and they even have a giant greenhouse full of tropicals for those of you with an atrium or humidified home. Their cacti collection is equally impressive...I'm an AZ native and I've never seen some of the alien looking succulents they carry! People, places like Baker Nursery are the direct result of YOU supporting local independent business! One visit here & you'll be hooked :)
4	I have been to the spa on multiple occasions and have to say I think its my favorite in phx area. I was just back again for a facial - I tried the perricone's antiaging facial this time and it was to die for! so relaxing, and I definitely had a glow. Try to go when you can stay and enjoy the amenities, as the whole set up is super nice. They did a renovation a couple of years ago, which it really needed, and it's a great get away. I haven't stayed at the resort, but would hit the spa anytime!
3	Nice to see something living at the dying but not quite dead Town and Country.  Went to Trader Joes, stopped by Cypress for lunch.  It was just ok. Friendly service.  Competent but nothing outstanding that is for certain.  Had the Gyro dinner with the greek fries, not bad, pretty tasty.  Rice was bland, skipped that.  Also had the greek salad, average.  My coke was nice and fizzy, not flat.  I look for that too by the way.  I preferred it better there when it was a coffee shop so long ago.  But it is good to see some life there and people eating outside.  May go back, but never out of my way for the Cyprus Grill.  I can still see the ghost of Juttenhoops  in the corners of my eyes though.
4	I eat at pita jungle at least once a week and at most about 3.  The Indian School spot is conveniently located between my apt and my work - a 10 mins drive from either.\n\nMy typical lunch there is the beef gyro ($6) with passion fruit ice tea which hits right on the money with my lunch budget - $10bucks. Sometimes i get a multiberry smoothie to go, which I highly recommend.  Its this lovely purple color, tastes of fresh berries, and its not too sweet - a healthy and refreshing alternative to desert.\n\nI experience sudden inexplicable cravings for their beef gyro at times.  The meat is delicious, the pickle and tzatzikii compliment it so well... I'm getting cravings just thinking about it.\n\nIf you decide to get some hummus as a starter, I recommend the small order with 2 pitas (comes with 1) instead of the large order which seems better suited for 3+ people.\n\nI had the seafood provencal from their seasonal menu yesterday, and it was so very delicious i was literally making yummy sounds (mmmm..!) after every bite.\n\n\nTheir lunch crowd has gone down in size recently, maybe because its so hot out.  The parking in that strip mall is hell during lunch time too.  There are various different lunch establishments and drivers can get pretty aggressive when they see a car pulling out.\n\nThe 2 seater tables they have inside are a little cramped.  I prefer more space between me fellow diners and myself and some of my heavier friends find it a little difficult to wedge between tables without interrupting seated diners. Also, forget about having a private conversation if there is a table seated next to yours. The tabletop is at capacity with 2 plates and 2 drinks.\n\nThe inside of this location has a huge mirror hanging that make it feel way bigger than it is.  It also brings in tons of light and lets you check out the crowd, or more notably, the hot hipster wait staff. That being said, I've never, not even during any super busy lunch rush visits, had bad or unsatisfactory service.  They run lunch rush like a well oiled machine.  \n\nOne last thing, I am a very thirsty individual, and I love me some good iced tea, on a couple occasions I've been offered refills for my tea in to-go cups. I know its a small thing but, for me it goes a long way.
5	I've been coming to Nousha for years and she never disappoints or makes a mistake... best beautician in ALL of Phoenix! \n\nI have very thick, curly hair and she has been the only stylist to figure out how to tame and make it look pretty :)\n\nShe also does my eyebrows, brazilian & facial wax, and a fabulous job with permanent make-up (eyebrows).\n\nHer prices are ridiculously cheap compared to everyone else and she's so hospitable and friendly. You won't regret coming here - I recommend her to all my girlfriends and family members.
1	"""We booked this hotel as they're the nearest to the Phx-Mesa Gateway airport.  Believe me, that is the ONLY advantage to staying here.  First of all, we programmed our GPS to the address listed for the hotel, and it wasn't in the GPS.  After driving some extra miles, and figuring this out, since I'm somewhat familiar to the area, we finally made it, and arrived to check in around 9:00pm.  When we told the front desk staff that the GPS hadn't worked well to find them, they said (very flippantly) \Oh yeah, GPS can never find us.\""""  Turns out that the posted address of the hotel is the MAILING address ('cause everyone need's a hotels mailing address, right?!), and the physical location is in Gilbert (not Mesa), so the GPS can't find them at the mailing address.  Besides this irritation, and the staff apparently thinking this was quite funny, I then asked for a couple of extra pillows for our bed (as we both have some back problems, and need extra pillows to sleep comfortably.)  I was told, \""""We don't have extra pillows.\""""  Huh??  You're a hotel, right?  (No apology whatsoever, either.)  We arrived in our room, and the temperature was STIFLING.  It was well over 100*F in Phoenix, and the room was shut up tight with NO air on.  We set our thermostat to 74*, and it ran non-stop until 2:30 am to reach that temperature, as it was over 90* when we entered.  The next morning, we went down for the complimentary breakfast, which was VERY ordinary.  Nothing horrendous, but nothing special either.  Oh, and their wifi worked in some areas of the room, and not in others, and when I called, I was told \""""There are no problems with the wifi\"""" and got absolutely no help at all. I fly in and out of Phoenix multiple times each year, but I'll be looking for somewhere else to stay next time.  You should too..."""""""
4	From June to September, this is a great place to escape the heat.  You ideally need to bring a sweater and perhaps some gloves to keep you comfortable. When looking for this place, remember it's towards the back of the shopping plaza and is a few retailers East of the Wal-Mart.\n + + +'s = escaping the heat, friendly workers, nice rink, can hold parties. - - - 's = beaten up rental shoes (similar to other rinks and bowling alleys, maybe they sell them like that), not much to do beyond skating (i.e. old video arcade games)\nFor a skate and an escape from the heat, this is a good place.
1	Dear LGO - I'm pretty sure I'm done. Thanks so much for all of the marginal meals I've had at your restaurant. Once upon a time you rocked, alas, no longer. I will bid today my final farewell. Here is the jist....do I mind the snarky, lousy attitude staff? not really, do I care that there is never anywhere to park? nope, thats not it as I can always valet...the bottom line is when you add it all up....bad service, wicked crowded, completely overpriced, lack of organic options, your staffs amazingly entitled attitude, ALONG with marginal food? no thanks! I will take my 15 dollar breakfast elsewhere.\nAs a last note, the screaming by the order up guy kills me....constant screaming of names, when I was there, I felt like I was stuck in a time warp at tutor time. As to negate any bad karma, good luck in 2013.
4	I have been here 3 times. Once just for drinks, once for lunch, and once for the sunday brunch.  They have an excellent diverse menu.  At a glance, the menu is american but seems to be inspired by mediterranean, middle eastern, indian, caribbean and latin american flavors.   I love the wings, burgers, steak salad, chicken sandwich.  Cons: they put way too much cheese on everything, the salsa and guacamole is below average.  And the thing I love most about this place is the design.  They took a mid-century modern bank and turned into an ultra sleek modern tavern.
4	"""Great place for the tall guy!\n\nI think the chain goes something like this...\n- Nordstrom Stores sell the current season inventory. \n- Returns and season closeouts are sent to \The Rack\"""" at discounted prices.\n- That which does not sell at the Rack, is sent to \""""Last Chance\"""" to be run through at the lowest prices.\n\nAt least that's the way I understand it in AZ.\n\nI love the joint because I can get unhemmed pants here for a reasonable price. Not cheap, but reasonable."""""""
5	"""First time hikers and mild workout-ers beware, this is a challenging and strenuous hike for the unprepared! This hike is more for avid hikers and workout fanatics.\n\nTo the normal eye, this seems like you're average hike since it's sitting in the middle of a household community. To get here, you park next to houses on the street curb. \n\nTwo of my classmates and I went up the \Blue\"""" route and traveled down the more vertical route. The blue route almost seemed like rock climbing! I was climbing on rocks and realized one slip could result in a painful fall! Going down was definitely far from easy -- it was like huge rocks and using all muscles in your arms and legs were necessary.\n\nWhen you do finally accomplish though, it is very rewarding. We met people from Utah and other states that fly down here just to hike this mountain! They were nice enough to give us a ride back to our car since we traveled down another path. \n\nTip: Bring work out gloves, you get your hands dirty climbing rocks. Brings lots of water and a hat! And, bring your A game - this is no picnic!"""""""
5	"""This gym is just plain awesome.  Not too big.  Not too small.  Just the right size.  Look I've turned this review into the Three Bears Workout.  \n\nFor those of you that have not been to an Anytime Fitness, they are just that.  Anytime.  You are given a key fob that will allow you to access any of their gyms nationwide anytime.  I go back to visit family in Oklahoma and can go to the gyms there.  The thing that I like the most is that when I went in to get a membership, the staff was beyond easy going.  No giant sales pitch.  No up-selling.  No gaming.  Just a \let me show you around the gym\"""" and \""""here is our pricing\""""  Done.  They have a small class area upstairs that can be used for video based workout classes when they don't have live classes going on.  \n\nPros\n-Open anytime you need because you have the key to the door.  \n-Cheap pricing.  \n-Good, well maintained equipment.\n-Clean changing rooms that are private.  No shared locker rooms.  \n\nCons\n-No childcare. Might be a deal breaker for some people but I don't take my kids to the gym with me anyway\n\n-Staff hours are short.  Not necessarily a very big con but it would be nice if they had some days of early morning staffing.  \n\n-Cameras everywhere. I understand the reasoning for it as you may be there by yourself.  It's there for safety and also for protection of the equipment but you kind of feel like you are being watched at first."""""""
1	I just had my car in for a auto accident during the visit the shop broke the ignition on the car. They are taking no responsibility and said it was already broken they had the car for a week, if it was already broken how were they able to stop and start the car that whole week! The repairs are going to run more than 600 and they will not even help pay for half. Don't take your car here it was their location on cave creek and hatcher!
4	Had to write an update after my most recent experience here but to be honest I am not sure why I only gave them 3 stars in the first place.  I went here with a group of ladies to celebrate a birthday and we got 1 of each of the bruschettas as well as the cheese board and a couple bottles of wine.  The whole thing came out to be surprisingly affordable and even more so since my sister had purchased a group-on.  We took over the couches in the center of the restaurant and had a very enjoyable evening.  Our server was great and put up with our indecisiveness and they even allowed us to bring in homemade birthday cupcakes.\n\nThey also have great food for lunch.   Soups, salads, and panninis are all delicious and make it worth coming even if you can't partake of their fantastic wine list.  Their patio has tons of shade umbrellas and misters that really do their job and so it can be very enjoyable to sit out there, even in the summer.
4	"""I was pleasantly surprised at Cafe ZuZu.  We had so much food with a fantastic wine and wonderful service.  \n\nOur meal consisted of short ribs with mashed potatoes, beef stroganoff with sour cream, double friend french fries, brussel sprouts, and truffled mashed potatoes.  (I see \truffle\"""" and usually I have to order it.)  \n\nEverything was cooked very well and we just HAD to share.  Did I mention that the service was excellent?  \n\nThe decor is not my style, but done well and it was a very nice evening with good company."""""""
1	"""The staff was nice and accomodating, but I really wish that I was informed at booking that they were going to have a fashion show and  a live (extremely loud) band poolside all evening. (Although the band was good )  \n\nUnfortunately, the whole reason I booked this hotel was so my husband could relax in the pool/spa and that was impossible. We couldn't even relax in our room with all the noise. \n\nOur bedroom window faced the elevator and there wasn't proper window shading available for me to get dressed without an audience. I had to get ready in the cramped bathroom in order to have any privacy and that was uncomfortable. \n\nFor the price I was really not impressed. I've stayed in much nicer \true\"""" resorts for less money... and had more comfort in cheap hotels that I did here.  Had we been able to access the pool/spa during our stay I would probably have a different opinion of my experience as it is a beautiful feature of the hotel, but that feature was taken away from us and I feel ripped off. After this weekend I won't be going back.\n\n."""""""
3	Like the one in Chandler, this place is a bit pricey with decent food.  It's not spectacular, but pretty good.  The best value is their happy hour, and the food choices at happy hour are moderately varied and fairly good.\n\nOne thing of note is that their sushi doesn't use raw fish.  We've had two different rolls now, and neither had fresh fish in it.  It was cooked/prepared in some manner.  It wasn't bad, but it's better if it's uncooked and fresh.\n\nThey really (really!!!!) need to turn the volume down in the bar area.  They have TVs going that you can't hear because they are blaring music at an obnoxious level, and everyone is shouting because otherwise their companions can't here them.  I expect loud music at a happy hour like this, but theirs is really excessive.
3	Decided to try this breakfast place that actually got good reviews. Was seated right away. Place looked nice, lots of\nspace and country decor. Tables had carafes of ice water which is nice in AZ. Ordered decaff and o'pear eggwhite omelet. Quick and friendly service. My meal was served with potatoes and English muffin. The omelet was good maybe too much Havarti cheese and the bacon was kinda bland. The pears were tart and my muffin was cold. $13 not bad but shoulda hooked myself up at home! Would give it a other whirl, wasn't terrible but nothing to run back to.
4	Sprouts was recommended to me by a local apartment complex manager while I was in town looking for a pad. I was staying at a resort in a little condo-type room, and stopped here for grub to cook. Find most everything you'd find in other grocery stores, but with a deli that I understand is to die for. I got salad stuff, drinks, coffee, and fruit and was pleasantly surprised at the bill. \n\nI still think I'd prefer Trader Joe's, but granted...I've only been here once.  I'll be living in Phoenix within 8 weeks and I'll give it a few more chances.
5	"""First time I came here, I was visiting. After I moved here to AZ, I am still going here! Their quinoa burgers are fantastic. I always get the \naked burger\"""" (served on a bed of greens) so I can skip out on those extra carbs. \n\nIt is nice they have a drive thru...went through it once and the gentleman at the window was very friendly. Also addressed me by name (gave him my credit card to pay), which always makes someone feel special! Great service and food!"""""""
5	"""OMG!  Love Chelsea's Kitchen!  Love it.  First, you MUST have the Chicken Nachitos!  The Roasted Chicken Spinach Salad is awesome. This is what I order most of the time because I think it balances the Chicken Nachito pig out that prefaces the main course.  However, the Fish Tacos are great too!  I love hanging out on the Patio.  It's so lovely and the weather is getting nice now to sit outside.  Perfection.  The staff is great and the service is fast but not rushed.  I wish the owners would open up a  place in South Phoenix -- we are \hungry\"""" for  non-chain restaurants!"""""""
4	"""My g/f picked this place to go for lunch otherwise I never would have had it on my radar.  I also wouldn't have thought of an \egg place\"""" for lunch. They have an extensive menu with traditional \""""egg\"""" dishes like scrambles, omlettes, crepes but they also have salads and sandwiches and they also have a \""""Healthy\"""" section on their menu.  I decided to go with the Spanish Omelette.  I wish I would have asked for no sour cream and a side of pico but, other than that, it was delicious.  It came iwth a slice of wheat toast and nstead of potatoes I chose the fresh fruit.  Very flavorful and filling.  The service was also very friendly and prompt.  I will go back."""""""
4	I celebrate pretty much all special occasions with Chinese food. It's delicious, usually cheap, and there are endless menu options to choose from (although, let's face it, I'll judge you by the quality of your lo mein). So when I first moved to Phoenix, I immediately began a search for delicious Chinese food somewhere near my house. \n\nBelieve it or not, it took more than a YEAR to find a place that was't truly awful.\n\nWong's Jr is a delicious island floating in a desolate sea (desert?) of terrible Chinese food. I tried Chinese places up and down the length of Bell Road, all the way down to Glendale and up to Happy Valley. It took a long time and a lot of heartbreak, but Yelp finally led us to wonderful Wong's Jr - truly, it was love at first taste. The service here is always super friendly, professional, and fast. Their dinner specials are fabulous -  they come with rice, an egg roll, a crab puff, and either sweet and sour chicken or what they call BBQ chicken (it's no bbq I recognize, but it's definitely delicious!). The ton of food they give you is always piping hot, and the quality never varies. Sometimes they'll even throw in free egg rolls, if you order a lot.  I have a hard time straying from the lo mein, and Andy F adores the sesame chicken, but everything else we tried was just as good. This place is a real gem, and one I recommend to everyone disappointed in Phoenix's Chinese food offerings. \n\nWong's Jr, we miss you already!
4	Although not authentic, George & Son's has pretty good Chinese food.\n\nWe went there for the lunch buffet today and the food quality was a notch above the typical Chinese buffet. There were about a dozen dishes, ranging from egg drop soup to sesame chicken to fried fish to Mongolian beef. They seem to know what buffet eaters want as there wasn't much veggies in the dishes.\n\nService was polite and prompt and empty dishes were cleared away quickly.\n\nThey did raise the price of the lunch buffet from what the previous reviewers mentioned, but it's still a good value.
5	My girlfriend surprised me with a birthday dinner at Shimogamo.  It was one of the best sushi restaurants that I have ever been to (I have been to a lot), and hands down the best I have been to in AZ.\n\nWe did as another reviewer recommended and, after giving our server some guidelines, allowed the chef and owner to send us whatever they wanted from the sushi bar and kitchen.  All of the sushi was very fresh and some of the dishes were as creative as they were delicious. However, our favorite was the miso cod from the kitchen.\n\nIn terms of price, our bill was in the $60 - 70 for two people, with a number of dishes and no alcohol.  Yes, this would be expensive for a weekly sushi dinner, but for a special occasion it was actually cheaper than other nice restaurants that we have been to. I recommend this restaurant for a special occasion for any sushi lover and for any occasion for the diner who can both appreciate and afford fine sushi.
2	They've moved to a new location on 2nd street.  We met a out-of-state friend here, half way between PHX & TUS. I figured to give her a good taste of the southwest. Since I don't live in Casa Grande, I thought I'd check user reviews from multiple internet sites.  Wrong!\n\nThe food was just so so.  The wait staff don't have a clue on how the food is prepared.  Apparently the food is prepared differently by different cooks (chefs?).  It's a crap shoot. \n\nI expect guacamole to be made with avocados, not green sour cream with undefinable lumps in it. As for the award winning green chili pork, I can't for the life of me understand what competition they won. \n\nIt's a nice place to eat if you like so-so food and a unknowledgable wait staff.
5	The series of 1 star reviews below is unfair, they place only has like 30 chairs in it total, in order to serve 30 people at one sitting, they would have to close the restaurant down.  I wish there was a civil service requirement where everyone would have to work in a restaurant.  The fact that these people assume they are the judges of east valley taste is ridiculous, I would hate to be around a table of 30 people all scheming to write bad reviews of the place their still in...\n\nEnough ranting.  The service here is very nice, the staff knows the place backwards and forwards and the decor is well kept and very Northern New Mexican.  It's a little disconcerting from the outside, par for many great places in Mesa.\n\nThe food is spectacular.  This is food that it takes time to make.  Pecan wood smoked shrimp, pork abodova all take time and good ingredients to get right.\n\nWe did it right here.  Had the New Mexican Corn Chowder to start, creamy and delicious.  Margaritas are huge and very good.\n\nFor dinner I had the Taos platter, Tenderloin Rejeno, Shrimp Enchilada and smoked pork tamale.  All of which were great.  I am a huge eater and could not finish my plate.\n\nWe did have room for a glass of port, nice liquor selection btw and an order of their banana creme brule which was a nice end to a nice meal.\n\nGreat place, great way to ditch the sonoran mexican food blues.  Unless you like Sonoran cheese and grease on a plate.  These chips and salsa were great, verde salsa and multicolored corn chips.  Yes!\n\nOh yeah, also very affordable, no dish is over $20, including the great steak my gf had.
3	Not bad every once and awhile.\n\nIt's inside a big office building and I didn't even know it was there. A coworker took me there a couple months ago. They have a variety of food, yummy bagel selection, they even have somewhat of a convenience store area near check out. I got a jalape\u00f1o bagel toasted with cream cheese (super delicious!) and a banana nut muffin for only $3 :) Later on I got the chocolate banana smoothie (which was good)... but I was a little put off to realize that I could easily make it myself and I just overpaid majorly for what it consists of since they make it right in front of you (ice, banana and a packet of Nestle Hot Cocoa... REALLY?!).\n\nThey have a good sized sitting area and make hot & cold sandwiches, salads, soup. There are daily specials. Prices seem fair but... lean towards the moderately overpriced based on the quality (I mean... the smoothie itself put me off...)\n\nSo... not bad over all. Just not a place I'd frequent on a daily or weekly basis.
5	I have never eaten at Roy's before, and I was NOT disappointed!!!\n\nFor dinner, I had the blue cheese encrusted Salmon with white and green asparagus (as did one of my dinner companions), and the other had the Mahi-Mahi.  We were all very pleased.  My friend and I who ordered the salmon found ourselves wanting to lick the sauce off the plate.  The salmon was perfectly cooked with a slight crispy edge.\n\nFor desert, my friend had a chocolate martini and I a hazelnut martini.  Both were yummmm-oooo!\n\nPlus, between the 3 of use we ordered the pineapple upside down cake, served with coconut ice cream, the chocolate souffle served with vanilla ice cream (the gooey center of this souffle was finger licking good), the creme brule, and the fruit tart with blueberry lavender ice cream (this was AMAZING ice cream).  You practically had to roll us out of there because these were all the next best thing to great sex.\n\nService was excellent and all was well worth the price.\n\nGOOOOOO!!!!
5	"""This past Saturday night was the pinnacle of my entire fine-dining life! I'm not joking and I'm not exaggerating, it was that damn good! Thanks to a Yelp event and Petite Maison's generosity, I was fortunate to win a 10 course meal with wine pairings for four people. I have to say, my hopes were very high and I went into the evening expecting to write a five star review. By the end of the night I was left wishing I could give a 10 star rating. Let's see if this review can do any justice to our night. Our reservation was for 7pm and I was accompanied by my fiancee and another couple.\n\nFirst off, our waiter/sommelier was Dustin. He was an outstanding server and a friendly young man. Dustin was unbelievably informative on each and every dish and wine served. I highly recommend requesting him when you make a reservation. Dustin gave the background and history of each wine along with how you should drink the wine with the food.\n\nWe started the night with a Bordeaux Sauvignon Blanc to accompany our first two dishes: bread puffs and a chilled Sweet Corn Soup with Truffle Oil. The bread puffs were freshly baked and delicious, but the soup was especially phenomenal! A great way to start the night.\n\nNext we had a Chardonnay to go along with a Beet, Radish and Multicolored Cauliflower Salad and then a caviar dish. The salad was light and delicious. The caviar was on top of a creamy scrambled egg with truffle I believe. By itself, the caviar was a bit too fishy for me, but when combined with the egg it was very good.   I appreciated this dish even though it wasn't my favorite since it was my first time trying caviar.\n\nA Pinot Noir was the third wine and the first red of the evening. This wine was paired first with pan seared loup de mer, which literally means \wolf of the sea\"""" in French. The fish was incredible! Definitely one of the highlights of the night! You may know it by its Italian name, branzino. We were then served an excellent soft shelled crab dish. It was fried to perfection and served atop a delectable sauce.\n\nThe fourth wine of the night blew us all away! We were served a wine by Domaine Faillenc Sainte Marie winery. It was made with a Cinsault grape (pronounced \""""sinso\"""", or close to that) and it provided the most unique scents and tastes that any of us at the table had experienced. I'll never forget this wine and I am determined to find it somewhere. Thank you Dustin for exposing me to its greatness! My fellow Yelpers, you have to check it out. The Cinsault was paired with duck and lamb dishes. Both meats were out of this world and prepared perfectly, just like every other dish we experienced.\n\nLastly, the two dessert dishes were accompanied by a port. Not a big port guy, but I guess it's the wine to have when eating dessert. For a port I actually enjoyed this one. The first desert was a slice of baguette served with cheese and fruit. The second were mini chocolate doughnuts with a heavenly cream dipping sauce. Perfect ending to a perfect meal.\n\nEach dish was spaced out perfectly from each other. I was shocked to discover that the Petite Maison culinary masterpiece took four hours. The time absolutely flew by. I ate every single bite and drank every single drop. Thank you Chef James Porter, Dustin, and Yelp for what was the most incredible and memorable dining experience of my life. Seriously, wow! Great food, great company, great memories. It's what life is all about."""""""
5	Our evfn (east valley friday nights) group landed at RT O'Sullivans last Friday evening and it was fantastic!  We'd arranged to have a separate area for our social group, so though the TVs were on they weren't so loud we couldn't hear each other speak. \n\nThe waitress (as far as I know) kept up with everyone's needs and the food was really good.  \n\nMy only issue is they only have pear cider. I prefer a hard apple cider like Strongbow and there were no choices.\n\nWe were treated so well I'm sure we'll be back again.
3	"""I have been to this Landis a few times over the last 10 years or so and it's a pretty good place to get some help and they have a good selection of brands to choose from.  \n\nStaff was help full helping me pick out my new bike, but I kind of already knew what I wanted from what I saw on the Internet.\n\nI ordered my bike, they said should be on Wed. so I called on Thurs. morning and they said \yeah we got it but we need to put it together, call you when it's done.\""""    ---FYI it takes about 15 minute to put a bike together.\n\nSo I went on Fri. morning (they didn't call) and they had it almost done and took about 10 min to finish.     \n\nKinda made me mad they were so blase about it."""""""
5	"""I had an amazing dinner tonight at Quiessence.  When we made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything; we were, so when we sat down we were given 3 glasses of complimentary champagne.  \n\nWe started with a plate of three delicious cheeses.  They have a huge selection of cheeses, probably about 20, and we chose a goat, a smoked gouda and a jack.  All delicious and served with crostini, perfectly melt-in-your-mouth bartlett pears, pecans, honey and quince paste.  Great start.\n\nOur next course we shared two salads - an octopus carpaccio and field green salad.  Both good.\n\nMy main course was AMAZING.  It was heritage turkey with mashed potatoes and carrots.  I ate every bite.  SO flavorful.  My dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes.  My mom got swordfish.  It was not cooked properly when it first came out, but they promptly corrected the problem, so i can't fault them for that.\n\nThe ambience was great including a live but not distracting singer and a warm crackling fireplace.  In addition, I want to give big props to the servers for knowing everything about the food they served.  She knew where the fish was caught, how the beef was raised, what certifications the turkey farm had achieved.  It is great to be able to get those kind of answers with zero attitude when you ask the question.\n\nMy only reservations would be 1) definitely is \slow\"""" food, maybe a tad too slow but so delicious it was worth it and they said they were short staffed and 2) i'm not sure i buy that their seafood is sustainable.  They served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish.  My understanding is that both of these fish stocks are pretty severely depleted.  I asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods, but I'm not sure (personally, for me, at least) that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger.\n\nAll in all though, a fantastic night and i can't wait to return!"""""""
3	Dined here on a Sunday night in July. Very hard to find this location, signage is not visible from Pima or from the entry to the shopping center. Eventually found it. Service was good, not great, pacing of the courses was a bit irregular. I had the Ahi small plate, wedge salad and double cut pork chop. All were very good, and well prepared. The manager did circulate towards the end of the meal and seemed very engaged with the operation which is a plus. Decor was pretty dark, which seems to be the norm in steakhouses these days. 4 stars for food, 3 for service, 3 for decor/location.
5	I LalalalaLOVE this place! Their pizza is so delicious!!\n\nI've been here many times and alway order my personal fave-- the margherita pizza!\n\nThe dough is just so amazing I can't even describe it. So good that it almost comes close to the amazing pizza dough in NY. [the water totally makes a different in the dough]\n\nI also got an order of the wings. They were not your average hot wings. They were baked and had a tangy BBQish sauce to 'em. [can't even describe the taste but were yummy]\n\nPlus, the restaurant is such a cute and trendy place to have dinner! It's almost always busy though even during the week! \n\nIt's a must try!!!
5	I fricken love Chipotle.\n\nThe perfect PMS If-I-see-this-person-ever-again-I'm-going-to-explode-so-you-better-calm-me-down food.\n\nOne of the few fast food joints that serves MARGHERITAS. Woohoo!! (wow, would I be classified as a lush? I better change my title)\n\nTheir chips and salsa is very tasty.  Not too hot and not just tomatos.\n\nI like the bowls... makes a good two meals for me.  Doesn't go bad in the few hours 'til dinner.  The black beans are awesome, although sometimes you get a spicy part that hits ya right in the throat... then you just drink your margherita and you're good. lol\n\nOutdoor seating with misters in the summer, heaters in the winter.\n\nThe modern look inside is awesome. Makes me think of Ikea, but I know it's not from there.\n\nAt least I hope not.  That would ruin it for me.\n\nThe best thing... it's a chain fast food restaurant, without tasting like a chain.
4	"""We always ask for Gloria when we visit. She is a sweet, Hispanic lady who loves to call everyone \baby.\""""\n\nOf course, you get free chips and salsa. I love the salsa in the squeeze tube. It is freakin' addicting. The beef tacos, as well as, the sonoran enchiladas are my favorites. Beef taco is straight up yummy and on the greasy side, good amount of beef and cheese. The sonoran enchilada is a gordita with enchilada sauce, cheese, and green olives. Their rice and beans are pretty good. When we are all in a drinking mood we will grab a pitcher of Marg's. \n\nInside it is your typical Mexican decor - bright colors, Mexican pots and pictures, and that kinda thing."""""""
4	I went to the museum to take some out of town friends. They have children, and honestly, I had no clue what else to do with them. they had a BLAST. What a cute, cute place.\nIt really reminded me of the children's museum in NJ. Very hands on and interactive. The kids had such  a great time.  Loved the little grocery area and pizza baking section. My niece and nephew just love playing kitchen, so they had a blast.\nEven the gift shop had some really great educational toys.
4	What a truly pleasant surprise...good food in a car wash/convenience store...who would have thought?  The service was AMAZING...very helpful and right there when you needed it!  Nice, relaxing atmosphere that honestly didn't feel like you were eating in a car wash/convenience store.  The BBQ platter with a 1/4 chicken, macaroni salad and potato salad was quite tasty,  but way too big of a portion for me!  They recommended a few different sauces for me and they were both delicious.  We'll be back!
4	"""I'm not breaking any new ground by reviewing Piestewa Peak.  But for those of you out there who are new to the Phoenix area or are just visiting, well, maybe you haven't heard of Piestewa...  My nickname for this hunk of metamorphic rock is \the StairMaster\"""" because I primarily travel the summit trail, and well, it's a big giant natural StairMaster.  Every step is is step up.  Literally.  Your buns will be burning by the time you get to the top.  And your prize is the view from the top - a 360 degree uninterrupted view of the Valley.  The best part?  It's in our backyard.  How great is that?!  Name another major city the size of Phoenix where you can drive 10 minutes to a trail head... okay, there are probably a few... but that doesn't diminish my appreciation of the fact that I can be on the trail with such a minimal time investment.  \n\nFor those of you who have hiked this route and are turned off by the crowds, I offer you an alternative.  Hike at night.  In the dark.  Yep. You heard me.  This is the way to do it.  Not only are you guaranteed much more pleasant temperatures, you are also guaranteed a moment of solitude.  It is quiet, lovely and largely untraveled during the darker hours.  Wait.  I didn't just say that.  It's dangerous and stupid to hike at night.  Don't do it.  I'm warning you. Your run the risk of stepping on a rattlesnake, getting bitten by a rabid ringtail or walking of a dangerous precipice and breaking your neck.   I hereby disclaim all liability (I had to throw that disclaimer in there, I'm a lawyer).  That being said, I enjoy hiking at night.  The city lights are spectacular.   If you decide to live dangerously, make sure you bring a headlamp, some water, hiking poles, and a friend or two."""""""
5	"""This place is unbelievable and here is why:\n\nI had my car towed there at 4:50 pm on a Satuday afternoon and was so worried they wouldnt be able to help me (seeing as they close at 5:00 pm on Saturdays.) I called ahead and talked to Stan, he said they would be happy to get me in and get everything done that day. I was shocked. When I arrived, Stan greeted me at the door, walked out to my car with me, and recommended a plan as far as new tires and rims. He knew my budget was low, and that I knew nothing about cars. So, he recommended something that was reasonably priced and safe. He had everything done within 30 minutes (keep in mind, he stayed after hours to do this for me!!) and even left me a little \care package\"""" in my car.\n\nStan - you are wonderful!!!!! Thank you!! :)\n\nIf you are in need of new tires, rims, or any trustworthy car advice, go see Stan and his team! They are awesome!!"""""""
4	So, I know that there are tons of reviews on this great little Irish Pub, but after driving by it a million times, I finally got to go in...it was a Monday, but a good experience none the less.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the beer was good.  I had the spinach artichoke dip and it was quite tastey although a little watery for my tastes.  I don't think Monday is the best way to judge a good Irish pub, but it reminded me of the pubs I went to when I was in Ireland.  I hope I can convince someone to go back with me soon!
5	As I was looking to diversify my workouts, a friend suggested I pick up crossfit a few months back, and specifically recommended Crossfit 480 as the place to start it up. They couldn't have been more right- from the day I started I have been hooked, and appreciated the way that Derek and Brian run their gym. Derek is an excellent instructor, truly defining what a coach is. He is constantly making sure that form is accurate and pushes everyone to a higher level of fitness. They have created a community at Crossfit 480 that is uncommon, even for crossfit. All the members are supportive and hard-working, a reflection of both Derek and Brian. \n\nIf you're thinking of joining crossfit, DO IT. And if you happen to be doing so in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, try out Crossfit 480!
4	In quintessential Bianco style, every ingredient is chosen for its quality and, as a result, you have a sandwich worthy of a love affair. I always stick with the tomato, mozzarella and basil - the basil is bright, crisp and fragrant; the mozzarella is the real deal firm and milky; and, the tomatoes are always bright and soft but not mushy. \n\nThe bread? The bread is perfect. Absolutely. Perfect. And just the right bread to sandwich filling ratio. \n\nBeverage choices (especially low calorie caffeinated ones) are limited, but you can always run next door to Lux for an iced tea or coffee. Personally, I enjoy a sparkling mineral water to compliment my lunch here. \n\nIn your lunch sack, you will find a sweet treat to finish your meal. Most recently, I had a dark chocolate cowboy boot. My favorite is when there is a French caramel. \n\n4 stars instead of 5 because: the limited beverage selection and, mostly, because seating is limited and outdoor only. \n\nOn a nice day, they are a solid 5 stars, but lunch hour after a night of rain that has left the the wood benches damp enough to transfer or in 115 degree summer heat, they drop to 4 stars.
5	What makes this salon great:\n\nExcellent customer service\nTechs do your nails exactly how you like them\nBeautiful nail shape\nExpert french manicure\nNo chemical smell in salon\n\n\nBack story:\n\nI started coming to this salon after finding out about it from a living social deal.  What I liked about this place is that they seemed very friendly and also they don't do acrylic so the place never has a strong chemical smell.  Yay for no chemical fume induced headaches!  Plus the techs don't do a funky v shape on your nails that so many salons do these days.\n\nSo, I started getting shellac french manicures there, and did have a bad experience. The product seemed like it was going on goopy but the tech continued. She even said she was having trouble with it.  To make a long story short, it did not last and even started turning black, which was pretty bad for me since at that point I was in Mexico at a friend's wedding and stuck with nasty looking nails.\n\nI went back to the salon as soon as I got home to get the shellac removed, and the tech taking it off told me that shouldn't have happened and they were done wrong. She offered to fix it for me but she wanted to charge me for a whole new manicure.  The owner was there and I thought she knew what was going on so I was rather upset. I left and did not come back.\n\nSince then I have tried several salons in my area, searching for a good place.  In the process I have had some really bad experiences - extremely aggressive, even mean techs, ugly shaped nails, etc, and they all smell bad inside from chemicals.  They don't even try to get your nails how you like, they just don't care.\n\nI went back to J'adore and talked to the owner. She told me she didn't realize what had happened last time I was in and apologized. She seemed very sincere and sweet.  I got shellac and pedicure.  The techs did a great job.  The nail shape is great and french looks really nice.  They really took care of me and really care.  They will make sure you are happy.\n\nThis is my salon.  You'd have a hard time to find a place this good - believe me, I tried.
5	I am native to the Phoenix area and have been going to the Duck and Decanter since I was a small child, in fact my older sister used to work there. They have really great sandwiches that are high quality and very tasty and they come with great customer service. This is a good place to enjoy breakfast or lunch with a client, friends or go by yourself and enjoy the free Wi-Fi. Plus they have a great little meeting room that they let people use. I use it every Wednesday for my networking group. Wonderful place and an institution in Phoenix.
4	the boba drinks here are awesome--my go-to drink is the passion fruit green tea with boba.  it has a great ratio of fruit juice to tea, right boba consistency and sweetness, ice, etc.  only downside is they only serve a LARGE size (so instead of a 2000-calorie drink, it's a 4000-calorie drink, j/k)... and i'm not really digging the graffitied walls inside the shop.  the little bomb guy cartoon is cute and all, but i could do without the rest of the stuff.\n\nit's definitely the best we've found in the valley, just about on par with some of the best boba shops in cali/vancouver/etc!
3	"""If you don't like beer this is not a great place to get drunk, unless we're talking about getting a sugar high from the root beer....I was meeting up with some friends here and didn't know that the only beverages were different kinds of beer.  Seeing as how I don't like beer, that kind of sucked.  I must say the root beer is pretty tasty though!  As a side note though, they do offer a sampler of the 8 beers that they brew in house for only $6.50 and they're decent sized glasses too.  My husband really enjoyed that.\n\nAlso you probably shouldn't come here if you're hungry.  They stop serving \food\"""" after 7:00 (their food menu consists of either a hot dog or nachos).  They have a folder of menus from other restaurants that supposedly deliver; however, the majority of them close around 10:00 and the one that was open later \""""tries to limit their deliveries to one a night and your establishment has already been delivered to.\""""  Better be content with trail mix or popcorn from the machine that they oddly have in a corner.\n\nThe service was good, the girl was friendly but not overly so.  Basically the whole experience was average.  I didn't leave hating the place but I didn't leave counting down the hours until I went back."""""""
4	"""The neo-Coliseum!... where the padded gladiators come to fight other padded gladiators unto the death!  The splendor!  The greatness of our new Rome in PHX!\n\nMy analogy may be a stretch (I am, admittedly, a former FS who loved to hit), but a stadium really does set the stage for a fight, whether it is circa 127AD or 2013AD!  The Cardinals Stadium (now sponsored by a notorious degree-manufacturing institution) creates a great setting for a special game or event.  The stadium is easy to navigate in-person, and the fung shui is generally on par.  That is, it has a relatively \new\"""" feel, plenty of amenities, and great views throughout most of the stadium.\n\nReady for my complaints?  If not, I am:  the online seating charts and visuals suck.  The upper deck is much higher than the lower/ mid-level seats, and anywhere below the upper deck probably even offers a better view from a slanted angel.  Not knowing this, I incidentally purchased two different sets of tickets (one set for a slanted lower-deck view and another for a side, upper-deck view) for the sum of over $500 only to have to sell two for a $100 loss.\n\nThe stadium is also frigid-cold in the winter.  Considering that they have a dome, they open it (probably wanting to save money instead of heating it) and the Western sun blinds (but warms... and even tans!) those in the upper Eastern side.  So, if you are sitting on the Eastern side (especially in the upper portion), bring sunglasses and/ or a hat.  Wherever you are sitting outside of the hot months, bring some warm clothes!\n\nIn all, I enjoyed the stadium and look forward to my next visit.  I hope that my tips help you to have the insight that I wished that I had!"""""""
4	I went to a Majerle's near US Airways Arena after a Suns game, and it was a lot of fun, but it was very packed inside.  Unlike the one in downtown Phoenix, this one in Scottsdale is more spacious.  The place has a great amount of sports running from hockey to basketball.  There are televisions at almost any angle you are sitting, so you never have a bad seat in the house.\n\nThe food is pretty decent for bar food.  I got a chicken salad of some sort when I visited.  I didn't have a beer that night, but my friends kept ordering away, so it must have been good.\n\nDan Majerle would be proud of this establishment that has a great sports vibe.
4	Down and dirty real Mexican food.  Strap on your kevlar vest, use the bathroom (so you don't have to use theirs), and get there before dark.  \n\nAll kidding aside it's actually quite safe during the day. There are always plenty of cops, EMTs and firefighters getting their taco on for lunch.  I think it's a requirement for municipal workers to eat here at least once a week.\n\nThe buttered tortillas will absolutely change your life.  I have dreams of their green machaca burro.  \n\n[pauses to salivate]\n\nThey are REALLY busy between 12:00-12:30, so try and get there a little before or after to miss the rush and long line.  Or call your order in on the way and pick it up from the shorter pickup line (you can still eat in the restaurant).\n\nAside from the ambiance, it might be the best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.
5	"""I was in phoenix on business for the first time Ventured in there by accident. An upstairs bar reminded me of my favorite college hangout so I gave it.a try. What I found was hardly a college dive. Very \groovey vibe\"""". Great drink selection. Good demographic mix in customers gave it a relaxing, welcoming feel. Really liked the music, which wasn't too loud. Sports on the TV behind the bar, which didn't I didn't expect with the look of the place, but I appreciated. Staff, was outstanding. Just a great place to relax and unwind after a busy day. \nThe Side Bar is now marked as \""""my Phoenix bar\"""" and I stop in on every subsequent return."""""""
5	"""I swoon over this place every time!  Let me say this: If you're in downtown Scottsdale as a local or out of towner (like me) it's a must dine.\n\nDecor:  Outside really does look like a pre-historic mission, but the inside looks like it's been gutted out to be placed with modern decor while still holding onto a \missionary\"""" style.  \n\nFood:  I absolutely love the guacamole and I'm not even a guacamole fan.  It has a nice balance of spice and limeness which compliments the fatty goodness of guacamole.  I opted for the shrimp chipotle skewers and they were delish!  Plump, spicy, and dipping sauce was awesomeness!  They have dipping sauce that leaves your mouth with a mini burn sensation which I strangely enjoy.\n\nWhen I'm in town, I make it a point to have @ least one team dinner @ Mission Inn weekly.

5	I have a new favorite sandwich place!\n\nI've probably driven by Breadcrafters over 3.000 times since I moved to Phoenix.  It's in an unassuming little shopping center on Tatum across the street from PV Mall.  I noticed the sign but never thought twice about going in until my friend Deborah recently told me that they have wonderful sandwiches and salads that are perfect for picking up when you're on the run.\n\nSo, instead of trusting Deborah 100% (I don't know her THAT well yet), I sent my mom in to try Breadcrafters when she asked me where she should go for lunch during her last visit.  It passed the 'mom test' with flying colors... my mom loved it - she said it was perfect!\n\nToday was my turn... and needless to say, I was extremely impressed!  The staff was really sincere, friendly and helpful.  When I walked in, I smelled fresh bread and I saw several cases full of not only bread, but sandwiches, salads, and baked goods too!  Everything looked awesome!  I looked at the menu and noticed that prices were reasonable and they offered daily specials including soup/sandwich combo and 'the daily double' where you pick two different items to make your own combo.  It took me a few minutes. but I decided to design my own sandwich off the menu... I went with turkey, lettuce, tomato. avocado., sprouts, and spicy mustard on multi-grain alsatian bread.  It came with my choice of sides (I went with coleslaw) and a pickle.\n\nIf you've read my reviews, you know I don't usually go into detail about the food more than saying what I ordered, liked, didn't like. etc... however, I have to make an exception on this one.  The sandwich may sound like any other sandwich you could pick up anywhere, but this sandwich was special!  Every bite I took, I tasted all of the ingredients.  It was balanced perfectly!  Just the right amount of mustard and avocado spread evenly on the bread, fresh and juicy turkey. crisp lettuce, and ripe tomato.  Yum!\n\nI was there after 2 for a late lunch expecting this random place to be empty... but I was wrong.  The place was hopping!  I noticed that people were eating outside (it was a beautiful day) and that Breadcrafters is DOG FRIENDLY!  I also noticed that many people came in just to buy freshly-baked bread.  Not a bad idea - I'll have to remember that for next time we're entertaining!\n\nI overheard Angela. the (new) owner, tell a customer that the bread sold like crazy today, so I imagine the best selection is first thing in the morning... It may have been my first visit to Breadcrafters but it will not be my last.  See you there!
5	I firmly believe an establishment shouldn't receive 5 stars unless they are perfect.  \n\nI have tried to find some reason to knock off a star.  Maybe even label it 5 but call it 4.5. But I just can't. \n\nThis guy has it figured out.\n\nWhat first struck me about Centurion is the price.  If you want to show up and drop $50 a plate, sure Chef Eric will oblige you and steer you to the lamb.  But I've never left this place and left hungry for more than $10. \n\nHis lunch selection includes paninis, salads, the best risotto I've ever had, and mind-blowing burgers.  (Zinburger? Who's that?)\n\nDo you like wine?  Come prepared to have the perfect pairing with whatever you order.  You won't be sorry.\n\nThe service has never been short of phenomenal. Prepare to tip big.\n\nThis is my new favorite place in the downtown area.  Get here as soon as you can!
1	Los Taquitos is apparently quite successful. I know this before I take one bite of food, because their children are running in and out of the kitchen and around the customers' seating area playing tag and sounding like what I imagine a pack of rabid chimps might sound like. Only people completely unconcerned about where their next paycheck is coming from have the luxury of being as oblivious to their customers as this. The stories I've read on Yelp back me up on this - lines out the door? The food must be stunning.\n\nGuy Fieri certainly seemed to think so, but then again, doesn't he always. Me, not so much. I got the taco/enchilada/tamale combo plate, and nothing on the plate was more complex or interesting than anything I could get at Taco Hell for half the price. The enchilada was bland and boring. The tamale was dry, but at least there was bottled taco sauce to put on it, how nice. The beans and rice tasted like... nothing. Wet porridge and dry porridge? Cutting edge stuff - if you live in a nursing home. \n\nThe sole exception to this crap parade was the beef taco, which was extremely tasty. Too bad that even that was ruined by its size (just North of a silver dollar in circumference) and the fact that it had been unceremoniously dumped on top of the enchilada, rendering it too slippery to hold.\n\nSo if your idea of a great taco shack experience is eating two tablespoons of great taco meat with a fork surrounded by formica and fail, then you're in luck. For my part, I think I'll chalk this up as another Fieri fiasco. I doubt anyone at Los Taquitos will care - why should they? They've obviously got all the customers they need.
1	I have given this place three chances. Why I will never know. Each time has been unpleasant \n\nIts close to my work and today I wanted a salad for lunch. There were only 3 tables of people, all already enjoying (I think) their salads. So I think it will go fast and I order one to go. 10-15 minutes later I finally get it. No clue why ti took that long. Seriously. \n\nSo here I sit at my desk, trying to choke down the most disgusting salad I have ever come upon. Wendy's makes better salads then this place! I ordered a BBQ Chicken Salad. The chicken is actually grey in color, GREY, so I have picked around all of it. The salad is really soggy and I have no idea what the dressing is, but its wrong! Just Wrong! I'm starving and now out the $9.50 I paid for this bowl of nasty :( I feel like a sucker. \n\nAlso they asked me if I wanted a roll. I said yes....never got it ;( Thanks for ruining my lunch Tossed.
5	The Van Gogh exhibit is very much worth seeing. Floor to ceiling video display of his works, with some floor panels exhibiting video as well. \n\nEach wall, of which there are many in this maze of an exhibit has video playing. This means that although there are people wandering through, you'll be able to glance left or right and see the video on another wall. Obviously, the more crowed the museum, the more difficult to see, but it only takes about 30 minutes for the video to complete it's cycle.  You can stay and see the parts you may have missed as it starts over on a continuous loop. \n\nOn exit, you can buy a book and video. I don't recommend the video, it seems to have been shot while the exhibition was open to the public so you have people wandering through the DVD scenes as it's being filmed. It's not so much that they obscure the view, it's just simply too distracting. \n\nIf you're a member it's only $8 for the exhibit, slightly more if you're not a member. Go, it's worth it. \n\nIt's OK for teens but the younger children we saw there were bored to the point of being somewhat disruptive.
4	Since relocating offices from our midtown branch to our downtown branch, not only have I experienced a dramatic decrease in stress (begone, Dragon Lady!!), but I've also been able to expand my lunch dining portfolio. One that I was eager to add is Five Guys. I've stuck with the Little Bacon Cheeseburger with mayo and hot sauce (yeah, I'm weird) and tried both regular and Cajun fries (go with the Cajun). Aside from it being so busy and spending an average of 8 minutes in line and 9 minutes waiting for my burger, I've been very happy with Five Guys.
5	Tried this place out on a friends recommendation, and all I can say is WOW!  The food is amazing! (I'm still eating as I write this!)  Everything is perfectly seasoned, fresh, and cooked to the peak of flavor.  I ordered the Orange Chicken, Beef Fried Rice, Mongolian Tofu, Crab Puffs, and Spring Rolls.  I am in Love and will never settle.  The delivery time was great, and the driver was really nice.  Will definitely be ordering from them again.  My Belly is happy!\n\nThe only draw back was that I had to guess at the menu, as they have no website, or Facebook where I can look over and choose my dinner items. My friend told me they have anything a normal Chinese Restaurant would have.  So I winged it, and am still happy.
3	"""I usually avoid this location due to the packed parking lot and store but this day, I was feeling saucy. \n\nI went in just to browse, which always means trouble.  The sales lady must have seen the target on my back, as they were super helpful and really paid a lot of attention to me. \n\nI got everything I needed and paid a lot for it.  I went it with a 20% coupon, which cannot be used on anything but the \non name brand\"""" side of the store. Major disappointment.  Probably the reason they don't get a 4 star on this review.\n\nOverall, you will find what you need.  The store is clean and nice and spacious and lots of inventory.  \n\nYou will leave happy, just don't come with a coupon cause it won't be honored."""""""
5	Delicious.  Everything.  Sandwiches, Wraps, Salads, Cookies, Smoothies.  Good value for the money. Clean.\n\nHere's the details:  The flat bread sandwiches are very inexpensive and delicious.  The Thai Chicken and Jamaican Jerk Chicken wraps are amazing.  They use some surprisingly different and fresh ingredients to make everything so much more special than run of the mill.  Immune Blast Smoothie kept me from calling in to work one day last winter...really, I was feeling so sick and then got one and was all better!  Speaking of Work, my co-workers took a poll and voted Blimey Limey as the one we all ranked in our top five smoothies.  The place is always clean, so is the restroom, and everyone hard working and friendly.  They do get busy though, so sometimes there can be a wait.  Call a head if you are in a hurry.
5	I loved it so much on a visit back to AZ for the week I dined 3 times...\nEvery person that went with me enjoyed it's delectable fare.. Even the Midwest steak eaters & teenage boys...\nI think that says a lot...\nEvery-time here  we ordered many things off the menu and shared... So many things I fell in love with on the menu...\nThe Kale salad, and pizzas, green tea soba noodles, and the PITA (trying to figure out the recipe)... the raw fish of the day... of course the juices... everyone was ambrosial, yes I tried them all!\nAll was prepared so delicately and with much culinary care. \nThis is the type of place you go when you want to eat healthy, and still feel it is gourmet, or you are trying to turn someone on to eating healthier...\n\nOr you have mixed eaters, picky, vegan, veg, no wheat etc.\n\nOnce again Sam Fox & his team are brilliant. I was told it took 1.5 years to plan this place... there was so much that could not (would not) be compromised...\nI was rather impressed that they paid for the full liquor license only to cary one organic rum and vodka...\nThey are taking a huge money loss by sticking to the philosophy... \nAlso with the demand that everything be fresh, the food cost must be frightening... \n\nI hope people give this a try... it is the most delicious well done foodie health food I have ever had... and I dine around. \n\nyum... I miss it already.
3	It's all about the sizzle, not the steak, at PVBC.\n\nThe burger itself is small and not very flavorful, if you get just a burger and apply pedestrian toppings. There was a bun - not much to say about it.\n\nThey're doing a neat thing with the fancy toppings, but when you consider overall value of what you get for your money, combine that with the hype, consider what you can get elsewhere, it's just not worth what you pay.\n\nFor the more mathey, that equation looks like this:\n $V = ( q+h )  { c   *\n\nor: \ndollar value of quality plus hype is less than competition\n\n* no 'less than' symbol for yelp text fields, how lame
1	"""The first time we went to the fair *cough* glorified carnival *cough* was three years ago.  I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone.  We went for one of the free concerts but left early due to the amount of marijuana smoke in the section of the coliseum we were in, me being pregnant at the time.  We swore off the state fair and had not returned.  \n\nSadly we promised our toddler a ride on the ferris wheel when the state fair came this year.  We figured we'd go fairly early and leave before dark. Some of the workers look like they are on a prison work-release program...we won't even discuss the general crowd that attends.   The food to us was subpar: \Super\"""" nachos for $7 that consisted of the kind of chips you can buy in the store, covered with cheese and hamburger meat; everything else including sour cream, peppers, tomatoes, etc were at least a buck extra. \n\nAll of the restrooms we used had no soap at all.  Interestingly, we went on opening day, and the blocks and mats in Toddler Town were filthy.  The fair had only been open for 4 hrs so I know the dirt was not from just that little time.  Lame animal exhibits, a \""""farm tour\"""" that has just a few animals but dozens of rabbits for sale.  More profanity from the mouths of kids (some who looked all of 10 years old) everywhere we walked, than I hear in a month.  On the way out, a herd of tweens-teens ran through the crowd, chasing after some other kids, while screaming profanities.  \n\nWe definitely will NOT be back.  We found a fair this summer in CA that was just awesome: clean, safe, and the best \""""fair-type\"""" food we have ever had.    We'll plan to go there next summer.  I'm sad that this fair is supposed to represent the state of Arizona."""""""
3	Hula's is set to replicate that of a mod 1960's, tropical bar with old surfer movies playing on the ceiling. The atmosphere gets five stars and the staff was friendly and service excellent but the food is overpriced and the food was satisfactory. I'm a huge ahi tuna fan; however, the Island Style Poke I wasn't completely impressed with. For vegetarians the Spicy Tofu Tacos were quite tasty but I would venture out to say that if you want a fun atmosphere with tropical style drinks, then this would be the spot. I was disappointed in the wine list but Hula's has a great selection of tropical drinks served in fun glasses. A fun spot for cocktails and their happy hour goes from 4-6 with $5.00 appetizers and signature tropical drinks. I won't say I'll never go in for drinks but the food I could live without.
4	Great place to grab a quality meal.  There is something for everyone on the menu and the outdoor patio is perfect at night.  The burgers are juicy and you can get anything you want on them; the pasta is very good and the specials always include a salmon that is very good and makes you feel as though you had a healthy meal.  If you are going on a date or out with a group, this is a great place with affordable food!
4	Oooh, see, no one told me Luke's does Chicago Style hot dogs. I went there a couple of months ago to try the dripping beef sandwiches that everyone is raving about. Ok, normally I'm a big fan of anything beef-related, but that type of sandwich is more targeted toward my dad, not me. However, the Chicago Style hot dogs are absolutely delicious. I also love the presentation...they wrap up the hot dog with a sheet of paper, and drop the fries inside the packet and roll everything up. It looks like a wrapped burrito. The staff was amazing, as well. Very friendly.
1	not a fan.\n\ni truly believe people are tricked by the decor. it really does make you feel cute and happy, but it's like a wolf in sheeps clothing bc the food and service suck. this applies to every fox concept, i've decided. \n\nour waiter was a diva, and not in a good way. he rolled his eyes at me several times and all i did was ask for lemon with my water. then i asked for vinegar and oil on the side instead of on my salad. it came on my salad so i asked politley if i could have a new side salad. he got so pissed and grabbed my plate without saying anything. when he returned he just slammed it down in my face. i would have walked out if i wasn't with people. i hate rude servers. \n\nthen i ordered the kobe burger and it was burnt on the outside.  and it had no flavor. i had to salt and pepper the crap out of it.  \n\nlast time i pay $17 for a gross burger and rude service, i don't care how effing cute your patio is.
5	"""Since I'm on a Torta fix, I had to try this place out. \n\nI felt pretty \guera\"""" walking into the place as all of the customers were clearly spanish-speaking only as well as most of the employees. Embracing my latina half, I ordered a carne asada torta to- go in my best spanish, which is about on par with a three year old idiot child. \n\nBe warned, not the quickest torta you're gonna get, I waited nearly half an hour. Luckily, they have telenovas playing on the tv, which are fantastically amusing, even if you don't speak the language. \n\nBut it was well worth the wait-my torta was delish! I got it with everything, which included pico de gallo, lettuce and mayonnaise, all on grilled bolillo bread. Amazing.\nThey have a huge selection of tortas so there is something for everyone. \nmmm tortas, where have you been all my life??"""""""
4	Ok all you people that bitch and complain about fees at a venue is stupid. You go to a concert right? EXPECT to pay fees! If not then happy day for you :)\n\nThat's how the venue makes there $$ IE drinks, parking and so forth. Parking was $5 BTW\n\nAlright now on to the review. This place is sick!!!! Loved the setup. We went to see Bassnectar here last week. SOLD OUT show and I kid you not you could still go to the bathroom without waiting 10 minutes. Drinks are reasonable, $6 beers or $6 well rum & cokes. Not to shabby then going to let's say a Dimondbacks game and paying $10 for a 8oz cup of beer. Also love the smoking area out behind the bar were you can get whatever  kind of cigarettes you want.\n\nSecurity was a lil tight. If your gonna bring drugs to a event then be smart people. Come on really!! Saw at least 4 guys get taken out an hour before the show started for dealing RIGHT IN FRONT of security. o.0 no sympathy at all. \n\nPlace is a little run down on the inside. Could use a little up keep but seriously who goes there for how nice the paint is on the walls haha?! \n\nAll in all. Will defiantly come see another show here
5	Maybe I am over-rating based on my nightmarish experience at Merle Norman but I don't care... \n\nI wanted to find a foundation after being abused not 5 minutes earlier... I looked terrible I'm sure.  I was told I could wait a few minutes and Yvette (i think?) would help me.  So after what felt like forever (probably maybe 10 or 15 mins) she kinda invited me to take a seat and I told her what I needed.  She picked a few colors and said she could do my whole face or just match me.  Since I was so depressed about my other experience I said What the heck, go for the whole face!!!\n\nShe was funny and nice and very outgoing.  Exactly (IMO) how a customer service/cosmetics type person should be.\n\nI was so happy at the end of this experience... My face looked really pretty, I LOVED the colors!  She listened to what I wanted and was really knowledgable and had a gentle hand.\n\nThat said, would never wear that much make up (although it did look pretty) and when I got home the color still wasn't what I was looking for but I would go back in a hear-beat.  Sephora and Yvette saved the day!  I'll definitely be getting the all the colors she tried on my eyes, lips and cheeks... GENIUS!\n\nBack to MAC for the foundation though... I regret ever straying.  Live and learn right?
4	Liked it!  It's in the W hotel and my first trial of this chain.  The decor is great and I loved the large tables.\n\nSushi quality was very good.  I still prefer Nobu, but this chain is very comparable.  I had the usual mix of what I like: edamame beans, unagi sushi, a sashimi mix, rolls and their rock shrimp.  I first fell in love with rock shrimp at Nobu, and I think Sushi Roku does a very good version of it!  Tasty and good sized potions.  The fish has a nice flavor and texture.  The rolls were good quality - we had a spicy salmon roll (not on the menu but they allowed the subsitution), tuna toro with jalapeno, and a dynamite.\n\nThis place is pricey but I was happy with the meal and service and would return.
5	"""Another great coffee shop :) \n\nThis one is perched amidst the fields of Agritopia, and the building itself is actually an old tractor shed. Once more, a \Joe's\"""" project that has a retro/modern industrial feel. \n\nThe dining room has a nice amount of tables and chairs and there is a sitting room at the back with some comfy couches and coffee tables - definitely a cozy spot. The large patio is lovely when the weather is right and the surrounding foliage keeps it from befalling the \""""parking lot effect\"""" that so many Arizona patios face (parking lot effect definition: a great patio that is spoiled by a view of parked cars, smells of exhaust, and sounds of traffic - those things the Coffee Shop is NOT, thank goodness) \n\nThey have an awesome bakery counter (My favorite thing!) Try to get there in the morning for some DELICIOUS muffins, which are shaped like little loaves instead of like traditional muffins. I always try to find random seasonal flavors that aren't always there - the best one I've had was a strawberry lemon poppyseed muffin - to die for! Also high marks to the cinnamon roll, a peanut butter chocolate scone, and any of the cupcakes. The cookies and whoopie pies are hit and miss - they look adorable but don't quite stand up to the other offerings. \n\nThe food-food is also great - again, my preference is breakfast and we always share the Papas Breakfast Burrito (with eggs, bacon, potatoes, and salsa) as it is HUGE and definitely large enough for two, particularly if you're also getting a pastry. I've tried the Turkey Cranberry sandwich at lunchtime and it was tasty as well. \n\nI have not actually had their coffee, but my sister and grandmother, who are both connoisseurs, swear by it so I feel comfortable recommending that as well. As for me, I'm usually ordering a big glass of fresh OJ. \n\nI wish that they were open later (they close at 8 or 9pm most nights, 4pm on Sundays) - its the type of place I often think of for a late night snack and coffee once I've put the little one to bed and I'm always disappointed to remember they're already closed!\n\nLastly, as of my last visit with my son they did NOT have a changing table in the women's bathroom. Considering the large numbers of families/moms who frequent the shop, it really seems like a given and I was a bit shocked that they didn't have one - I ended up toting my son and what was left of my meal out to my SUV to change his diaper in the back, which doesn't exactly match up to the serene coffee shop experience I'm planning on when I come out to the Coffee Shop :)"""""""
5	I promise you.  I.  promise.  you.  These are the best burritos (note: calling a 'burrito' a 'burro' is dumb and only prevalent in PHX) in town.  They are bigger than a baby's arm and have very moist chicken throughout.  The 'Crudo burro' with rice and beans plate is CRIMINALLY INSANE.  Their salsa comes in a squeeze bottle, which i love because of the regulatory physics behind squirting delicious red salsa onto a burrito bite-by-bite.  They also have churros, which is ALWAYS a plus for me because I'm crazy about them for dessert.  Prices are slightly steeper than your typical neighborhood Mexican joint and they DO have a drive-thru, which you must call ahead for, then pick up at the window.
5	Phoestivus is a super-fun local holiday market, designed to promote small, locally-owned businesses.  It's held at the Wednesday night downtown Farmer's Market, and this year, expanded to two weeks.  The beer garden was a brilliant addition, and 100% of the profits from it go to support Community Food Connections, the wonderful organization that keeps downtown Phoenix from being a true food desert.  Local brews, local food trucks, local farmers and artists assure that the money you spend will stay here in our community.
5	Great lunch specials at $10 or less and a massive amount of food. I alternate between the Sakana Lunch and the Chicken Matsuri. Today I had the Chicken Matsuri lunch. It came with two big peices of sliced up chicken cutlets with this teriyaki like sauce (almost like katsu), salad with shrimp tempura, california rolls and a side of rice. One plate is enough to feed two and only $8.99 during lunch. \n\nI also came here with some coworkers one night last week. They have customer appreciation (happy hour) on sun-thurs til 9:30pm! Buy a beer and get an appetizer for 50 cents. Also a decent list of rolls for under $5. To sum it up, good food and nicely priced.
5	If you've been to Harkins you've been to them all. If you've been to AMC, you've seen every AMC in the U.S. No offense to either of those establishments, they both provide film to the masses, however Madcap Theaters is something different, something unique. \n\nLet's say you've been wanting to watch that film from your childhood, the one that scared you, the one that made you dance, the one that made you laugh, or the one with that awesome scene that you watched over and over until you wore your VHS out. More likely than not, Madcap will probably be showing one of those on a Friday night.  \n\nLet's say you've been wanting to watch that film that your favorite website has been talking about, or the film that has been creating buzz all over the internet, more than likely Madcap will be the first in Arizona to get it (cough, Survival of the Dead, Frozen, Precious).\n\nLet's say that you always wanted to go and witness first hand what it's like to go to a Science Fiction and Horror film festival, guess what? Madcap has one. \n\nWhat I'm getting too is that Madcap is not your everday cinema. It's unique, cutting edge style has something for almost everyone, the film, music, spoken word, theater, even parkour buff can find people that love what they love. It's rare in a big city to find a place like this, and that's what makes Madcap such a special place. Kudos Madcap staff for pursuing something greater than the norm. Ch..Ch..Ch..Check It Out.
4	"""I go to Whole Foods precisely once a month, on the final Friday. \n\nIt's a freaking party in a grocery store!\n\n#EVFN (East Valley Friday Nights) happens in the Wine & Tappas bar. Starts at 6:00pm on the last Friday of the mont until they boot the last straggler out.\n\nI'll freely admit it, I don't know what the hell a Tappas is. But I know what beer is, and Whole Foods has a veritable \Wall O' Beer\"""" to choose from.\n\nThe staff is great, the food is good, the eclectic mix of EVFN'ers is awesome. That Whole Foods not just tolerates us but *welcome* us is very cool.\n\nA party in a grocery store. Whodathunkit?"""""""
4	I like this place. It's close to work, that being walking distance. The employee's have always been friendly, the place is clean, and the food is always hot and tasty. I really enjoy the pepper chicken, kung pao chicken, and the chicken with green beans and I always get a two item combo with fried rice. They have all you can drink self serve dispensers and some great iced tea! The cost is always under ten dollars for me and I find that they are pretty generous with the portions that they serve you.
5	LOCATION: In the Sprouts shopping center on Dobson and Ray.\nATMOSPHERE: Wow! Nice! I like the atmosphere here more than the Scottsdale location (see review) because of the super nice patio with a lakeside view. Who would have thought that was back there in this Sprouts shopping center. Very nice surprise.  Crowd is diverse with families, older and younger couples. \nFOOD: Extensive selection of which was ordered:\n1. Hummus with ahi tuna - excellent! Comes with pita bread. I've tried the chicken version which is also very tasty. I like this one waaay better. \n2. Chicken sampler platter - beans, white garlic sauce, rice, grilled chicken, pita bread. I tried the chicken only and it was also very good. Nicely seasoned but chicken was tad bit on dry side would be my only complaint. \nPERKS: Looks like excellent happy hour specials (apps, drinks) M-F with reverse happy hour daily. Full bar available.\nSERVICE: Excellent. No complaints. \nCONCLUSION: Good food, great atmosphere. Will be back!
3	It's a doctors office nothing special, sooooo it's A-ok.\n\nThe best thing about this office is that you can get in that day are the next. They do not do that 3 month a head appointments like most doctors offices. Every time I have been there they are also on time with appointments times, no waiting an hour to be seen.\n\nI have only seen 1 doctor, she's alright. If your sick i suggest you give them a call or if you need a tune-up. :)
4	"""A friend recommended Med Fresh's falafel, so I thought I'd give them a try. It was so yummy! Usually you get big falafel balls, so each bite is either all falafel or no falafel. Med Fresh spreads theirs out so there's an even falafel distribution. This is very important. (Is there a Yelp award for using the word \falafel\"""" the most times in one review?)\n\nI went there for lunch to escape the office. Some people feel awkward eating alone, but almost everyone there was enjoying lunch solo. The guy at the register talked me into a strawberry-banana smoothie, which was sweet and tasted fresh."""""""
5	I've been to the cafe for lunch about a dozen times (much more than my number of check-ins would suggest) and each time it was consistently good.  However, I've never had the pleasure of dining inside the actual restaurant until Friday.\n\nThe service, food, and decor are all top notch.  Although the price of my entree was ridiculous in my opinion ($26 for 3 shrimp atop risotto), everything else was excellent.  The bread and pesto they give you to start is phenomenal, the lamb meatballs are tender and delicious as was the tzatziki, and the shrimp and risotto was perfect as well.  The margherita flat bread was just ok and we should have opted for one not as basic.  Next time for sure.\n\nMy only advice is to either make a reservation or come early.  The place fills up fast around dinner time but 6:30 is a safe bet for early-birds without a reservation.  Also, the better the weather the more prime the real estate on the patio so get there super early to reserve your spot out there.
5	Nobody told these guys, You get what you pay for. \n-----------\nBecause otherwise, they wouldn't offer free high speed Internet, free hot breakfast, clean and spacious rooms - for such a stupendous price!\n\nI think this place was meant for people whose family come here to the Mayo clinic for medical care. \nIt is a true residential inn, with a full sized coffee pot, induction stovetop, dishwasher. They also offer laundry services as well as a computer room and free printing of airline boarding passes. \n\nIt looks like a new, clean property with contemporary interior design. Definitely worth the price, since other high end hotels would charge you three times as much for the same amenities. \n\nThe only weird thing is that the induction stovetop was rotated 90 degrees to save counter space (think of a photo that is rotated into portrait mode, rather than the landscape mode it was meant to be in).\n\nBut again, this place completely exceeded my expectations. Will definitely check this chain out next time I'm on travel.
5	"""Best BBQ in Arizona!  Big portions, great sides, and great service.  I got the combo platter with pulled pork, brisket, and ribs...it was outstanding.  The pulled pork is exceptional.  For your sides, you have to get the Mac & Cheese!  \n\nIf you really like the traditional KC or TX BBQ joints that are hole in the walls with red and white checkered tablecloths (or none at all) and you have to walk through lines to get your BBQ, then you probably won't like Bobby Q's.  The food is great, but it is a somewhat upscale for BBQ.\n\nOh yeah, and the \Thank Q's\"""" doughnuts are great way to end the meal.  They're so fresh and gooey!!"""""""
2	"""Ok, I was really looking forward to staying at this resort, but I feel it was GREATLY overrated.  The only saving grace was the banquet facilities and the restaurant staff.\n\nI recently was in town for a business event that took place at the Westin.  We were discounted room rates (although still paying $200/room).\n\nI guess my dissapointing experience started when I pulled up to check in, and needed to promptly leave for an event directly after checking in, and was forced to valet my car (could not leave it in the entry for a few minutes).  They were definitely not very accomodating.  (on a side note, the valet option is one of the only options $27/night, otherwise you end up walking about 1/4 mile to a \guest\"""" parking lot.  Makes me feel really valued as a guest)\n\nFrom the website, it looked as if even the entry level rooms were quite spectacular... they ARE NOT.  The walls were paper thin, we could hear everything going on in the room next to us, as well as the maids in the hallway.  The shower was TINY, I haven't had a shower so small since I was going to college.  There was NO tub, as was stated in the room description.  There was also no Free WiFi.  I was rather shocked when I found out that after you pay $200+ for a room,  they still tack on daily charges for WiFi.  (seriously?? pinch some more pennies)\n\nI will say the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, and the food from room service was pretty good.  However, after paying resort rates, I would have expected a little more from the whole experience.\n\nI doubt I would stay here again, there are so many resorts in the Scottsdale area, and I am sure they would value my business a bit more than the Westin Kierland."""""""
5	"""There's no end of fancy schmancy pasta places out there, with the accompanying fancy schmancy price.  Even when they're not so fancy, you still are left wondering why you're paying so much money for a bowl of something that's essentially noodles with a spiced tomato and onion sauce poured on top of it.\n\nLook, I LOVE my Italian food, and I certainly like visiting the Old Spaghetti Factory as well as Babbo's on occasion, but even these places leave me thinking that their price is a bit inflated.  It left me wondering whether or not there was a \cheap pasta place\"""" out there--a joint that would serve up a decent noodles and sauce for a price that I would expect for noodles and sauce.\n\nOregano's--this is IT!  If all you're looking for a simple bowl of pasta like Nonna used to make, you need to order the \""""Bollo Pasta\"""" from this place.  It's bottomless, and the dinner version is $6.99.  The marinara is a little spicy (Southern Italian style), but really great.  If you're hungry, your $6.99 will get you as much as you want until you're ready to unbuckle your belt and go to sleep.\n\nThis is the best bang for your buck Italian that you will find in the Valley, hands down.  Is it the absolute best pasta taste?  No, but for a few bucks, you can get satisfying pasta 'till you want to basta.\n\nOh, and their pizza is pretty good too."""""""
5	My husband and I love this place! The pain killer is my favorite drink.  Pretty much every meal we have had here has been very good. Cool patio, cool crowd, cool place!  Food can be a lil pricey if you are on a budget but tastes pretty damn good.  They have tiki time happy hour m-f with $5 apps! We met the owner and his wife last week while we were sitting at the bar. They seem to always be there working - which to me shows they care about their buisness.
1	"""I rarely visit BRU because I know their prices are significantly higher than amazon.com, target and most other stores.  But for when I need something ASAP, I go there.  Our 4 mo old got a cold and we needed a humidifier fast!  So after working a 10 hour day, I run over to BRU, ask for help in identifying which one of the 15 humidifiers they sell is a good one...the lady helping me just read what was on the boxes and concluded that it \depended on what I was looking to spend.\""""  Really? That's all you got?  I noticed that half of the product boxes were severely dented in or visibly opened previously and repackaged.  There was even an instruction manual for one of them between the boxes on the shelf.  So I carefully chose the box that seemed to be least disturbed.  \n\nI checked out, got home 5 minutes later and opened the box.  The unit was clearly used, the metals parts were rusted inside and the serial number was blacked out.  I immediately returned to the store and told them about my damage product.  They just instructed me to go pick out another one.  I said, \""""are you kidding?  every other box i looked at has already been opened!\""""  I suggested giving me an open box discount on the open box of my choosing and she, the manager, said, \""""I'm sorry, I can't do that.\""""  I don't know how BRU runs things, but if they don't give managers power to give discounts, I can't believe anyone likes to work there. \n\nSave money and hassle, buy on amazon.com"""""""
2	"""After doing a little browsing in Old Town Scottsdale, we were feeling hungry, and my friend, who has not had Japanese food in years, wanted some. So I had my first sushi in the desert. \n\nRa is the place in Old Town, so in we went. They have cheap specials on the lunch menu, along with a full complement of jive ass rolls, sashimi, sushi etc. I ordered beef teriyaki, my companion shrimp tempura, and as appys, I asked for a spicy scallop roll, fried soft shell crabs and seaweed salad.\n\nThe crabs came out, 2 actually, for $9.75. Now that's a bargain! They were overly breaded, too thick a batter, which dampened the crab flavor, but it still tasted quite good. The seawed salad was abundant; I love seaweed, it seems such a direct and powerful way of communion with the ocean, a meaty plant. The spicy scallop hand roll was weak, the rice overcooked and the seaweed wrap, nori, rubbery, though the actual flavor of the scallop was good.\n\nAs we waited for the main course, I looked around the room. It's quite a nice design, the sushi bar a large square in the center of the big room, the walls a mixture of stone and brightly red panels, with large red globe lamps hanging from the ceilings, bamboo also a prominent motif. The bar is at the entrance, and they seem to have an abundance of Happy Hour specials.\n\nOur friendly waitress brought us our bento box, and I was surprised at the size and variety of side items. Coles slaw, spring roll, potstickers, stir fry veggies and a salad to go along with a decent amount of beef teryiaki,  tender slices of beef with a good, warm slightly sweet flavor. The stir fry was overcooked, unfortunately, and the postsickers and spring roll were pretty conventional, and a little out of place. But a very cheap lunch at $7.75.\n\nThis is a place that is about \asian fusion\"""" for the American palate, apparently a chain with outlets in several states, so one accepts the concept, albeit reluctantly. It's not terrible, just homogenized, but I don't get how an \""""asian\"""" restaurant can overcook veggies and turn out such a subpar hand roll. Rubbery nori? That's inexcusable.\n\n2.5 stars\nsee pix posted"""""""
4	I went here with a party of 6 on Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting when we got there which was nice.  It is an older place with tons of charm.  The place was pretty busy and you could tell that the waiters/servers/busers were clearly over worked.\n\nAfter sitting for about 10 minutes we had to flag someone down to get bread and place our appetizer order.  After that we only saw our waiter every 20 minutes or so so it was difficult to order additional items or to get soda refills.\n\nThe service was pretty blah but the food was excellent.  Everything I tried was top notch.  Everything was freshly made and delicious  Probably some of the best Italian cuisine around.  Definitely some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.\n\nI would definitely return but hope the service is better.
2	i was excited to try a new wine bar in the east valley. decided to try the living room for some happy hour fun on thursday.\n\nmy first impression is: \nthey did a great job with the decor and we sat in the bar. the doors open to very neat patio. the wine is 5 dollar a glass until 6pm and the selection is nice.  i did order bruschetta but did not end up eating very much of it since i wasn't extremely hungry.  it was OK, not fabulous like postino's bruschetta.\n\nour waitress was nice, however she was super busy and did not come back to check on us as often as I would like.  the music is super loud...i mean LOUD!! you have to scream to have a conversation and i did not like the selection of music. The variety was so strange, first they would play country, then disco, motown. if they stayed with one genre of music that would be great.  my preference would be jazz, r&b, top 20 in a wine bar.  unsure if i would return soon? perhaps in the future once things improve.
4	Swadee is bomb! I'm a Thai food lover and I've hopped around to a bunch of the Thai places in Ahwatukee/Chandler... This place is a great combination of authentic, quality food at a good price. They have a great lunch special for $7.95 that only goes up to $8.95 for dinner and its the perfect portion for anyone (I usually have extra left over!) \n\nI like spicy food and they definitely understand what spice is - I go with a level three to be safe and stick to the Pad Thai, Red Curry,  Panang Curry and Garlic Chicken. Always good, hot and fresh. Not to mention all the employees are super nice. Great spot!
3	3 1/2 stars. Delicious.  Was it the best-most watering experience, eh. But was it worth trying, for sure.  We celebrated my husband's birthday here, we were seated on the outside patio.  It was gorgeous, 60s in Jan...gotta love Arizona winters.  We ordered the clam chowder (soup of the day), and it was creamy and flavorful.  I would have enjoyed more clams, but it was good.  The bread is served with a house made pesto sauce.  Pretty good, especially since the bread comes out hot.\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the Carbonara and Paella.  The Paella for $32 was a very good size.  The shellfish in the dish was delicious, tasted super fresh, almost like right out of the ocean.  The pasta dish was a bit stingy in portion (eat lots of bread if that's the only thing you're ordering...mmm...more carbs.), but the sauce was rich and yummy.   I guess that is was the chef made when he was on Iron Chef.  \n\nOverall, great ambiance, beautiful resort and decent food.
4	"""Loud, but the food was great.\n\nMy girlfriend and I got seated in the back of the establishment by the TV room. This wouldn't have been an issue if the servers would have left the door closed, but this seemed to be an action somehow about the skill of their pay grade.\n\nNormally that would have been enough to make me get up and leave. I am so glad I didn't.\n\nThe Hemingway daiquiri was spot on. A daiquiri isn't supposed to be insanely sweet or sugary, and they got it there. It was sour like it was supposed to be, and high in citrus. I got a drink and my vitamin C for the day. That's WINNING! in my book.\n\nThen they brought out the soft pretzels and gruyere fondu. Holy hell, that was brilliant and delicious. Someone finally came up with a \foodie\"""" version of one of my favorite classics of garbage eating.\n\nAfter my pretzel-gazm I was offered up the skirt steak with green beans, bacon and fingerling potatoes. And again, I was blown away. I don't normally like skirt steak as it tends to be a bit chewey and hard to get through. Not so at Arrogant. It was just right. Not so tender it imploded when the fork hit it, but not so tough that your dentures would come loose if you visited this place from Sun City. \n\nArrogant Butcher is exactly what down town Phoenix needed. Its smart, the food is good, the service is on point, and its different. I woulda gone 5 stars if it wasn't for being sat next to the TV room."""""""
2	Went for lunch the other day because I had a coupon and I love Mexican food, so I was excited to give it a try. I have to say, I was disappointed. I had the shredded beef chimichanga- it was so-so. I've definitely had a more flavorful chimichanga at a cheaper price elsewhere. I was also not impressed by the service. Our waiter never came to check on us, other than taking our order and bringing the food, which meant we had empty water glasses most of the time. Not cool. But on the plus side, they have a killer bean dip. I'd go back just to eat the chips and bean dip, but probably sit in the bar for (hopefully) better service.
1	"""Seriously...The food is AWFUL!!!!  Stay away!   Save your cash and get a McFishwich and some pink slime at Mickey D's (it's that bad).   Any self respecting foodie or experienced seafood patron will hurl.   Just because Pete's \looks authentic\"""" don't get snookered.   The outdoor seating looks fun but the food will disappoint.   I should have known better than to try seafood in the desert.\n\nLet me discuss my pedigree for this assessment.   I'm from the east coast.  I grew up around a seafood restaurant eating Maine lobster, fresh scallops, fresh shrimp, fresh oysters, fresh claims...you get the picture.   The \""""fish\"""" at Pete's is literally just a square patty of processed fish that is overly deep fried in a crunch batter.  They don't even make an attempt to use something resembling fresh fish.    The deep fried shrimp (again, overly fried and crunchy) looked like it had been pounded flat with a meat tenderizer and then subjected to a rolling pin before being dipped in oil.   Both the fish and shrimp were tasteless.   On an equally disappointing level, the french fries (usually a saving grace when the main course if bad) were equally terrible.   The fries were undercooked, limp, lacked flavor, and just didn't look appetizing.   Finally (and let me repeat...SAVE YOUR MONEY) we come to the \""""Pete's Special Sauce\"""".   I can't believe they actually charge extra for this crap.   The sauce tastes like a cross between grocery store cocktail sauce and a hint of bad hot sauce.   It's watery, lacks any redeeming flavor profile, and bland.    If anything tasted OK it as the cole slaw that came on the \""""Messy Fish Sandwich\"""".  The sandwich is really nothing to write about (same crappy square fish patty, same putrid special sauce, cole slaw, and an enriched white bun...blah).   At least the \""""Messy\"""" had some flavor.\n\nTo top it all off, the staff is emotionless and bordering on rude.   My order taker came across as if he were a struggling college student who felt the job at hand was beneath him.   \n\nThe best (and I mean BEST) part of my experience was the water mister on the patio during a 100+ degree day.   At least they still can't mess up the refreshing feel of airborne H2O.\n\nAVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!!!"""""""
3	Picazzos is not very big and was filling up fast by the time we left. There is indoor seating, outdoor seating and a bar area. No exciting decor. Looks just like your standard Italian eatery.\n\nThis place prides itself on  it's organic and local ingredients. Which is great, but the price definitely reflects this. \n\nAccording to our server, both the regular crust and marinara sauce are 100% dairy free, so I did a create-your-own pizzza with veggies and non-dairy cheese (I believe they use Daiya).\n\nThe pizza was good, but not amazing. I like a lot of Daiya on my pizza, so when I go again I'll definitely ask for extra. Also, I ordered spinach on my pizza and I felt that the spinach wasn't fully cooked, just a little wilted. I like my spinach fully cooked because I feel that adds more flavor, but that's a personal preference.\n\nOur drinks took a while to come out, and for what we ended up paying we didn't get a heck of a lot. I'll definitely be coming back soon and see if I can't get them to veganize one of their specialty pizzas.
5	I have been going to baseball games & events at BOB aka Chase now  since 1998. The park is pricey for it's beer to the point of crazy town but all parks have you there just like my beloved Disneyland so you pay my friend. My experience hasn't been bad yet.. knock on wood. I have had great luck at the park with my nose bleed seats to the Owners suite I was in last Monday for an event. The food is good, the food service fast, the stands staff always helpful. I think this park has it's game on every night no matter what the event. YAY Chase!
4	"""Dexter loved it!  He's a 7-pound rat terrier and extremely social (I have NO idea where he gets it from!).  Went with Robert M and Brady.  When we got there, there were only a couple of other dogs.  By the time we left, there were probably around 20.\nThe park is clean, with plenty of seating for \the people\"""" and lots of shade.\nChuey, a toy silkie, had his way with Dexter and so did a beagle.\nDexter ran like there was no tomorrow!  This was his first dog park. \nHad to take him to Wag N Wash after, though, as he was covered in a few different types of doggie fluids."""""""
5	In Texas I would rate Rudy's about three stars however in the Phoenix area it is the best there is. They have nice moist brisket where you can actually see and taste the smoke ring. To me, you judge a good BBQ place by their brisket and this place holds it's own. If brisket is not smoked long enough it just tastes like crappy pot roast. That is unfortunately the case with most places in the valley. The only other place I can recommend around here is Texas BBQ House in Phoenix although once Rudy's moved in, even though Rudy's is a chain I have to say they are still slightly better. The Green Chile Stew is really great tasting. As is the turkey and Jalapeno sausage. Overall, if you are looking for good BBQ in the valley this is the best you are going to find.
1	I've been always loyal to AMC Theatres. The movie I was planning to see was sold out at Westgate, so I decided to drive 2 miles down the street to the Park West. When I went to buy the ticket's, the salesperson didn't even look at me. When I went to buy a pretzel at the consession stand, i said thank you and the worker just gave this stingy look. The only good thing about the theatre is that seat's are comfortable.
5	Have now been coming here about once a week for maybe three years.  Loved it on my original review. As you continue to go here you love it more. Great staff, cool regulars and new customers, very good live music (especially Brian), and our neighborhood hangout.  Come here and check it out because you will come back.\n\nI had written this and never finished it.  They ended up closing.  A lot of people were bummed because we all loved it.  Oh well.
4	Thought I would check this place out shortly after its grand opening to see what it was all about. They have a lemonheads logo on the outside of the building, which I considered a good sign since developing a taste for that particular candy when working at a movie theater.\n\nUpon entering, you notice the vast array of candy available in bulk, including all manner of gummis, gumballs, foil-wrapped chocolates and the like. Then it hits you... it's a warehouse store for candy! I resisted the urge to grab a basket or shopping cart. Somehow, I felt less guilty if I only bought what I could carry in my two hands.\n\nI perused every aisle to make sure I had inspected the complete inventory. I spotted a lot of childhood favorites that I thought had disappeared: Lik-M-Aid Fun Dip, Ice Cubes, Laffy Taffy. There were also some vintage brand candy bars that were never part of my vocabulary growing up, but I have been curious to try: Mallo Cups, Zagnut, Clark Bar. Finally settled on several different flavors of Lemonheads (did you know they make Orangeheads?), some Ice Cubes chocolates, Strawberry Milkshake Whoppers, and Sour Satellite Wafers.\n\nWasn't really planning on buying that much sugary stuff (and I'll ration it out... I swear!), but when the entire store is an impulse aisle, you gotta go with the flow.
4	Extremely GOOD well thought out sandwiches and the most tongue thrilling ice cream sandwiches ever !\n\nWe've now been here three times for lunch and between us tried most of the sandwiches and every time each one is great .\n\nThis time we had pulled pork with pickled red cabbage topped with a surprise of black radish on a fresh bun and the most delicious perfect curried chicken salad on a poppy seed bun . We both picked the salad as our side that is field greens with house vinaigrette and we got a different kind of house made pickle that really WAS a Five star pickle it was tiny almost white and was savory but maybe apple too . Most sandwiches are about $12 but are worth it .\n\nIf you never tried the fries you might want too between the size and all the house made dips I don't think they make a penny on them, I think the malt vinegar is good but we are not a fan of the truffle  (got to be aroma but for only $4 you can't blame anyone) ketchup ,also they are seasoned correctly to use with dips but alone the fries are over salted .\n\nThe only reason I didn't give five stars is the price of the salads when you add meat to them $18 I had one once and although IT WAS GREAT not worth $18 I don't know if the salad was smaller than it should have been or not I still remember the $7 extra to add the  salmon (maybe 2 oz)  also we've found service hit or miss when an unexpected rush of business happens  but had mostly good service .\n\nThe sandwiches are so tasty I have to eat the whole sandwich and I have no room for dessert and MISS the (to die for over the top) ice cream sandwiches I had once before after the $18 salad I had once .
4	En Fuego, located inside the Doubletree Resort, is best known for its great buffet breakfasts (06:30-10:00), but we just tried it out for dinner and were not disappointed.  The decor is up-scale, and since there were only four other customers on a Sunday night, the service was great.  The wine list is a bit pricey but agreeable.\n\nDon't expect exotic new cuisine, but the staples were all right on target.  There's a variety of tapas such as jalapeno-bacon-wrapped shrimp as appetizers, and the entrees are classics such as Delmonico steak, chicken breast, char, and a seafood medley.  We had the lamb chops and the pasta with spinach and mushrooms and both equaled anything we've eaten in the valley.  The former came with broccoli sauteed to perfection and an excellent butternut squash risotto.  We also enjoyed the chocolate romance for dessert.
4	I am a total fan of their drinks....and even a bigger fan of being able to get large drinks for 99 cents before noon and they are half price every day between 2-4pm.  \nTheir slushes are my favorite (lemon-berry especially) but occasionally I have to get a cherry lime...for ol' times sake...\nThis is one of the few places that can make me a pineapple malt when I am in need.\n\nYou can stop in at 9am and get breakfast or their burgers...they offer their full menu all day.  Their food is ok.  Often I get a craving for some tater tots or their french toast sticks.  More often than not I order one of their kids packs with a slush and go on my merry way....
5	My ex took me here a few years ago and when we walked in I thought to myself what the hell is he thinking and I refused to order anything, after he got his food he forced me to try it and I did. OMG it was so good we rushed back over and I ordered some tacos and have been hooked ever since. \n\nThe tacos are a little pricy and grease but they are the best, I have drove about 12 miles on a short lunch break just to get these addictive tacos. If you have never been you need to go but make sure it is after lunch and before 5.\n\nGreat food
1	"""Wow, how is this place still in business?  Where to start...there was a small line outside of this place, and the bouncers were taking forever to let small groups of people in, acting like the place was crowed.  So we wait, pay the ridiculous cover charges - both men and women - and walk into a dead, empty club!  No one was dancing, the place was empty - more people were on the smoking patio texting than in the actual club.  Why the hell are they trying to keep people out of here?\n\nWell, we head to the bar - insanely overpriced, weak drinks.  10 dollars for a cup of rockstar (Asked for redbull, he substituted without letting us know.  Fine if it's busy but the bar was empty.) with a splash of vodka?  Pathetic, even by Scottsdale standards.  Also, was charged an additional fee just for paying by card - not because I didn't meet a tab minimum, but just because I didn't pay cash!  Moving on, the music was unbearable, because their \DJ\"""" felt the need to keep singing along with the music over the mike.  Poorly.  I can only listen to a guy scream \""""yeah\"""" so many times before I want to gouge my ears with plastic straws.\n\nObviously, this place is in desperate need of cash, and trying to squeeze every last penny out of the people unfortunate enough to walk in here.  The illusion of exclusivity isn't fooling anyone - this place is a penny-pinching joke. My small group would like our wasted 75 dollars of cover fees back, or everyone we know will hear nothing but bad news about this place.\n\n(edit) Who called it? lol."""""""
4	"""OMG, I just went there to get a few little sweet treats. So much to choose from!!! I ended up with a wedding cookie, an apricot Klinche(sp?), an eclair, a cream puff, and a mini new york cheese cake. When I walked up there was a customer outside eating a huge italian sub, it looked delicious. Walking in, it's set up like a bakery, shelves behind glass full of a million different cookies, pastries, pies, cakes. The wedding cookie, perfect. The most fresh, soft, crumbly wedding cookie ever. The apricot one, don't know if I spelled it right, was yum! It was dusted in powdered sugar, filled with an apricot jam. The eclair, I just got the little one, it's enough, trust me! It's very rich, the chocolate icing on top is thick and rich. The custard filling was thick and creamy. Never liked eclairs much until now. Cream puff was good. Same custard inside as eclair, but didn't have the same \umph\"""" as the eclair. It was dusted in powdered sugar, didn't care for that mixed with custard. Overall fantastic. Try it."""""""
5	My wife and I wanted to check this place out after reading some of the reviews on Yelp. First, because we're trying to watch what we eat these days, and also, to try something different.  We were not disappointed.  We aren't too familiar with Indian food, and other than the usual curries and lentils, we had no idea what most of the stuff was on the menu.  Rest assured, the food was fantastic, but perhaps a bit spicy for my wife since she is not accustomed to hot foods.  In any case, the food was filling, spicy, and tasty.  If you are looking for something different and something healthy and vegetarian, give this place a try!
1	"""Went there this morning for an oil change and asked  them to check my brakes, ( which they installed on all 4 wheels less than 2 years ago), because they were squealing a little more than often.  I was told that all 4 brakes needed replacement as well as my rotors which couldn't be machined anymore.  The grand total was $664.  First thought was \ how the hell do the brakes go that bad when you were the ones to do them less than 2 years ago ?\""""  Anyway, I took it for a 2nd opinion @ Meineke Car Center on 41st St & Chandler Blvd.  Within 2 hours of dropping off, they called me back and told me my rotors had could be machined and that the grand total was $300.  How the hell does that happen......$364 difference ?  If you go to Brake Masters, Just Brakes, etc anyone off those chain shops and don't get a 2nd opinion, you are a complete moron.  This will be the last time I go here and wish the crooks nothing but the worst."""""""
5	Ok, so this ISN'T new.  It is actually a correction.  I didn't realize until I dropped off my car this morning that there's another place with a VERY similar name--SORRY!  \n\nI kept getting coupons in the mail for this place, so I decided to check it out.  I recently had an auto repair shop tell me I needed to replace both front & rear brakes and wanted a second quote before forking over cash I didn't really want to part with.  \n\nThey did a full inspection and not only negated what the first auto place told me but provided a report showing how much 'brake' life I had left before I needed to bring it in for replacement.  They could've just taken my money but this demonstrated they wanted to keep me as a customer and that's exactly what they got.\n\nI now take my car there for routine oil changes and other work (e.g., engine flush, etc) when necessary.\n\n7/1/08  Just dropped off my car for routine service.  They've now added free wifi for customers who want to wait @ the shop.  I luv me some free wifi.
4	Great little fro-yo shop, its worth a try. If you're a fan of tart flavors, it seems that every option here has a little tart in it. I would even claim that it is one of the best tarts that I have had in the greater phoenix area. While I can't say it IS the best, since there are what seems to be hundreds of fro-yo shops around the valley, Ive been to most of them in the CenPho, NoPho and Tempe (near mill ave) area, as well as a few in and around scottsdale downtown and north scottsdale.\n\nI came by because of a coupon I found in the New Times magazine for a buy one get one free, I always love a two-fer. Makes it easier to bring along your favorite gal (or guy). I saw the coupon in the last few months (Feb/March/April) editions.\n\nIf you're not a fan of tart, id swing by mojo yogurt just down the block from here. Mojo is a solid choice for fro-yo also.
3	I really like Pei Wei.  But you have to understand what it is.  It is a chain.  It is not quite fast food, but not quite a restaurant.  It is rarely great, but almost never bad.  It's consistent, like most chains are.\n\nThe crab wontons are tasty, and I love the sweet chili sauce that they come with.  \n\nMongolian Beef, Honey Seared Shrimp are a couple of our go-tos.\n\nThere are much better Chinese/Asian restaurants in the world.  There are also quite a few worse.  Like I said, it is consistent and reliable - and sometimes that's all I need.  I rarely crave Pei Wei specifically, but I would never turn it down.
3	"""Starpower is just okay. Not great, not awful, just ok.\n\nI really didn't spend a lot of money with them and maybe that's why the experience wasn't so great. But wait, aren't all customers important? Who knows what I might say to my friends, what I might need in the future?\n\nMy first purchase was for Apple TV. We went to Starpower because the system we have was installed by Tweeter which is now out of business. We wanted to make sure everything worked together properly.\n\nThe Apple TV installation was okay, but they accidentally unhooked the connection to the outside speakers. No problem, I just pulled out the receiver and hooked it back up. \n\nNext we discovered we needed a new universal remote. Luckily Starpower sells the same brand as the one we had worn out so we were in luck. They ordered the unit, but it took several follow-up calls to find out it was in. \n\nWhen I went to pick up the remote they hadn't programmed it. Initially they told me it was no problem to program it since the tech had recently been out to install the Apple TV and could just download the programming from his computer. Well that didn't work out. \n\nUltimately I had to drop off the old remote for the day so they could program the new one. Not such a big deal, but somewhat inconvenient.\n\nThe three-star review stems from two things:\n1) We wanted to watch a DVD a couple nights ago, something we rarely do, and now the movie doesn't show up on screen. So I guess we need to get them out AGAIN.\n2) Several times when I stopped in the store one of the employees that waited on me initially kept trying to \avoid\"""" me. And yes, I was always nice to them. Don't know why, this was just odd.\n\nI guess if you're going to walk in and spend $5,000 or more with them it's probably okay. If you need a piece here or there and are just spending $1,000 (like us) you might want to go somewhere else."""""""
4	Went for lunch at Claim Jumper, let me tell you, service was fast and friendly, food was quick, I was in and out in 25 mins! WOW, I didn't wait for a table, I just went to the bar area where it was open seating, if you are in a hurry for lunch, try eating the bar! Ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad, which is my fav dish, it's had almonds, sesame seeds, green onions and cilantro and spicy peanut dressing! So dang delish!\n\nOh yea I tried something new this trip too, dinning solo!! Wasn't so bad, but next time I will bring a book so I won't look so alone LOL  \n\nGreat place for a good lunch!
5	Dr. Cheng is the best Doc in the whole Queen Creek area.  He's funny, he listens to you, and takes his time.  He does meet with a lot of patients but it always feels he's taking the time for you.  I love that when I have an appointment with him, I get right in (no waiting) and NO I am not kidding.  This seriously is the best Doctors office that I have been to in this area and all of Arizona.  If you live in the Queen Creek/Gilbert area and looking for a good family Doc.  This is the place.
2	Went a bit after happy hour with a few friends. The server was quite nice and helpful at first but he was a tad forgetful. I mentioned a sushi roll to my friend since it looked interesting (neither of us wanted to try it and told the server this) but he brought it out anyway. He did not charge us for it though so that was alright.\n\nThe main reasons for the low stars is that although the variety of sushi is great, they don't make it that well. Also the use of sesame seeds on top of every roll is unneeded. The soy sauce was bland and not the brand it said it was. Also when one of my friends was eating their sushi roll they found a bone in their yellow tail.\n\nNot an experience I wish to repeat. The only reason they get 2 stars is because the server was quite nice about everything.
5	My review is mostly for Julia, my waxer. She helped to make my first and subsequent experiences there more comfortable. There is a little private waiting room within the salon/spa and there is nice music and a small fountain. The girls bring you water while you wait. Maybe tea/coffee too, but I'm not sure. \n\nI want to go back to get my hair done and possibly get a mani/pedi. Any girls with me on that one? \n\nI purchased some hair products there too -- I recommend the Bumble & Bumble line.
2	Okay, so for the most part the food seems edible, however I wouldn't recommend getting the Asian dishes. You don't go to Mexican food place and get a burger, don't go here and get Pad Thai. First of all it was served with a lemon instead of a lime and the eggs were all in one big clump. It was as if I ordered scrambled egg with noodles. I wasn't impressed.  I might go back and try something else . . . if I didn't have any other options.
5	Wow! The tabbouli salad here was impressive, fresh and delicious. \nThe gyro meat was thickly sliced, ot thinly sliced like most greek places serve.\nThe hummus was flavorful and had a kick to it.  Maybe paprika?  \nThe pita chips are fried in house. They where served hot and greasy.\n\nMy entire dining experience here was amazing and alot $$$$ cheaper than the other greek place that we frequent! \n\nFREE WIFI at this place! Not bad.  \n\n***You will need some serious mouthwash when you're done eating here.  So I don't recommend it if you're out on a date*** smooch smooch, no, no!
1	"""The food is good and I have always loved going here for lunch or dinner...until the roaches crawling on the walls, the tables - EEEWW!  Click on the date for any \complain inspection\"""" and you will see they find roaches here - continually!  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=129281&business=SWADDEE%20THAI%20CUISINE&address=5055%20%20%20W%20%20RAY%20RD&permitid=SG48994  I have stopped going here and, instead, go to Yupha's Thai which is better food and, no roaches.  Note that the Via Linda location does not have any problems and, in fact gets awarded Silver or Gold awards from the Maricopa County Inspections.  It is only the Chandler location that is a problem and should be avoided."""""""
5	Wow...where has this place been all my life? Or at least since I moved to Phoenix :) By far and away the best pie I've had in the Valley. At Yelp's suggestion, we tried out this joint with another couple and we all had a great experience. Our wait on a Friday night was only about 15 minutes and during the short interim, we hit up the bar for some drinks. After being seated, our very friendly server explained the specials and took our orders. Between the four of us, we ordered olives, Caesar salads, funghi, BBQ chicken and Yukon gold pizzas. Holy schmoly were they good. It is difficult to find crust like that and you can tell they have the right type of oven to make an amazing pie. The large pizza is plenty big for two people and the pizza my husband and I split (the funghi) was ahhhhhmazing. The flavors were bold, rich and oh so satisfying. \n\nThe quality of food at this restaurant warrants much higher prices than what they charge. Affordable+delicious+great service = a returning patron.
4	Though the decor in this place is a bit old school, I love it. I especially love the Phil Collins music that is ALWAYS playing before the movies. The chairs are comfortable and I've never had a bad view of the movie screen. I've been here MANY times and often take out of town guests here for a unique experience. My Husband and I also like to come on weeknight date nights. \n\nThe food is ok. We've had things we love and things we don't. Time and time again, I love their salads. Something about that cabernet vinaigrette that gets me every time. They also put cranberries and feta cheese in it, which I love. The tenderloin sandwich is another item we get regularly and each time it is made well and tastes good. The piece to resistance however is the popcorn. My god, the popcorn. Something about it being popped fresh and having real butter is just magical. Get it, trust me, I wouldn't steer you wrong. \n\nGo to Farrell's! It is a great concept, they play good movies, and it's a cool local spot to hit up. PLEASE keep this place alive, I would be sad to see it go!
4	"""I love me some diner food and this is a good place to find it.  4 stars for the diner category.  Our first visit here was for brunch.  I tried out the Carnitas Skillet.  It was good, but I discovered carnitas is not great in a scramble.  The potatoes were great.  My wife had Huevos Rancheros and was gracious enough to share with me...good stuff.\n\nThe kids had a burger & mac' n cheese.  Both were good.  The staff here was very friendly and helpful and every request for this or that was met with a \sure!\"""".\n\nOur waitress was very good and had this almost Amy Winehouse look going on.  I thought she was hitting on my wife as she kept referring to her as \""""sweetie\"""" or \""""honey\"""" or \""""babe\"""" or...but by midway through the meal this had transferred to all of us."""""""
4	Reasonable prices, good service, over-priced snacks (like every other theater) and comfy seats! I do enjoy this AMC very much though when I have to come here versus the Harkins on Northern.\n\nThe one MAJOR drawback and this is a BIG WARNING is that if you go on the day of a Cardinals home game, EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE has to pay $10 to park in the parking lots at Westgate. The parking attendants will give you a ticket to take inside and AMC has a person there to give you back the $10 but the fact that you have to pay it to begin with sucks. What if I didn't have cash on me? This by no means is AMC's fault. I suspect it's the City of Glendale's or the Cardinal's convoluted way to soak people but at least you do get the money back if you are paying attention.
3	We come here pretty often when we do 'kid's day out' with my nieces and nephews.. well, we went this weekend for another event that brought us to the Tempe Marketplace and, although it was a Sunday, it was quite busy and thus it was both noisy and dirty.  \n\nThey have a lot of staff, too, to keep up w/ the demands of the business, but maybe not enough cleaning staff.  Tables were dirty and so was the drink area... plus, there is *always* a line for the bathroom...\n\nFood was decent: I had the mozz panini (which was very tasty), but both my friend's paninis (which had more ingredients than mine) were boring as dirt... my friend's Salmon Club was very good (per him).  It's Paradise food.. not too inventive, just mildlly enough to make you want to order it.\n\nThis place is OK given it's central mall location, speed of service, tastiness of food, cleanliness.
5	The Fiesta Bowl in Tempe got sooo popular that they sponsored another one in Glendale AZ this year.\n\nIt got my creative juices flowing and now I'm trial ballooning an idea to you Yelpers\n\n****  Football needs an Asian themed bowl!!  ****\nIf it were Vietnamese, it'd be a Pho-Nam-Enal Bowl\nIf it were Japanese (or Hawaiian), it'd be a Pearl Harbor / Snack Attack Bowl.  \nif it were Cantonese, it'd be an Endless Rice bowl\nIf it were Korean, it'd be a Spicy Christian Bowl\n\nOR I'd have it right here in Palo Alto (the Stanford Stadium-Go Jim Harbaugh!) and invite the two highest academic all-American teams.  I'd use a complicated formula that's similar to the BCS poll and input characteristics like avg time to graduate, pctng of self financed tuition, weighted difficulty of courses, avg salary offerings upon graduation, and standardized testings.  \n\nThis Oriental Bowl would be sponsored by Princeton Review, McGraw Hill, Miller Lite and Apple Computer.  Chino Bandito and Beard Papas could cater it.  We'd fly in 1,500 mainlander students and have the first marching Orchestra half-time show.\n\nMaybe when the Oriental Bowl gets popular enough, we can host the a sister bowl at Cal Berkeley OR SJ State.  Any ideas on the name of this Bowl??
4	Made the trek to this unassuming place after watching Man vs. Food showcasing the restaraunt. Hubby and I couldn't resist the temptation of the humongous tortas on the tv. After a studying the menu for quite some time, I ordered the Arizona torta along with a Pina Colada drink. Figured this should fill me somewhat.  The Olympics were on tv, which garnered most of my attention, until the food arrived. It probably took ten minutes or so for the waitress to return to our table with our glorious, fancy, fruit decorated drinks and a moundful of torta goodness. One bite of the sandwich= instant fan. The sandwiches are really large, so even half was enough. I will definitely be back. Next time, I will try the chilaquiles with eggs and steak...mmmm
4	Went for lunch with a friend. We love the quick, hot, and good lunch. She had the chicken parm, it came with a salad and pasta. She was super happy with the food. I got the white pizza with sausage. It was good, but I was missing the tomato sauce on my pizza, so I guess I am not a white pizza girl. White pizza = cheese and oil olive. I love their classic pizza = cheese and tomato sauce. It was more than enough for lunch. YUM. The server was awesome, love her.
4	I liked it, liked it a lot!!  Finally decided to check it out, and was in the vicinity.  Very easy to navigate, the only problem was it was kind of a Yogurt Teen Wasteland.  Way too many kids and teens going to town on the free samples, I mean they take way more than a free sample should be.  I kind of felt bad for the patient employees dealing with the spoiled Biltomre youth, and all, but what can you do?  Someone has to do it.\n\nAnyways, great frozen yogurt, they had about 10 different varieties, I had the lemonade with skinny strawberry and some blueberries, raspberries and strawberry mix ins.  The lovely wife had raspberry razzmatazz or something like that with peanut and berry mix ins.  I think I had no idea how much it was going to be because it ended up being over $5 but I was cool with the price considering how tasty and fresh it was.  Hers was over about $3.50.  Also, the mix ins are very fresh and great selection.  The very friendly and patient guy behind the counter told me they are all fat free, so I felt better.  But it is the same price as Cold Stone Dead Creamery, which is friggin horrible and disguisting Ice Cream, this is million times better choice.\n\nJust be careful as they weigh it like they do in a hospital cafeteria, we just got our stuff and got out of there: Night of the Living Rich Teens, we'll pass on that, but will be back for sure.  Want to try the other flavors....\n\nRecommended.
4	When I was a little girl, one of the few foods I just couldn't stomach was eggplant. My mom served in drenched in egg and fried in oil. Even as an adult, I just didn't see the point of the lowly vegetable. \n\nBut Pesto's changed all that. The first time I tried their grilled eggplant pizza all I could think was, Eggplant-- where have you been all my life? Maybe if my mother had been Italian... \n\nEverything at Pesto's is made from scratch, from the pasta to the salad dressing. And he sophistication factor just went up with the recent addition of a wine bar.
4	Finally, after many months after finding out of this place, we decided to go for a date night. It was as good as I had previously read and we intend to go back. My husband feels this place isn't appropriate for take-out food and perhaps he is right. We both had a glass of wine, (husband had two) and started with the grill baguette with creamy roasted garlic/olive oil  and the crispy shrimp/okra. The baguette dish was okay but I am always a sucker for bread dishes. It was $5 but I was just remarking to my husband that at St Francis, they brought us bread with olive oil complimentary. So basically, at Tuck Shop we paid for the roasted garlic. But, hey, I am not complaining...they gotta make money, right? The crispy shrimp and okra was so delicious and I rarely go for the fried dishes. I really loved it. The batter was light, flaky and it came with two sauces (One sweet and spicy and the other an herbed yogurt sauce). I don't generally go for yogurt sauces but really liked this one. To share, we ordered the mac and cheese and the Medjool dates. I don't really like dates but my husband really wanted to try them. Boy, am I glad he did. They were stuffed with chorizo and cheese with a bed of dressed arugula to the side. I could have eaten the arugula for days. It had this oiled, salty dressing that reminded me of the dressing they use on salads at Korean BBQ in Mesa. So good. And not to forget the fig that was also delicious. It didn't have an overly fig taste which might be why I liked it as much as I did. The mac and cheese was really good, too, but not my husband's taste. He felt the cheese was a little grainy but it was reminiscent, to me, of a parmesan sauce which can be grainy. I loved it. It had bits of what I think was bacon and very yummy. I actually had the mac/cheese  leftovers for lunch today and it was still as good. The decor was nice although my husband was a little put off by the fact that it seemed like a higher end restaurant that used paper napkins and put paper covering on the tables. He also felt like with the wide open dining space, it felt like a high end cafe. I can see his points but they didn't bother me. Our bill was approx $57 which for three glasses of wine and splitting four plates, was pretty good. We were very content with the amount of food we ate. The menu wasn't very extensive but that's okay. Like I said, we would definitely go back and try some other things on the menu.
5	Best nights to go to Postino's are Mondays and Tuesdays.  They offer $20 deals where you get 4 slices of bruschetta out of the 12 that they offer and one whole bottle of the house wine.  Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4's.  Perfect for sharing!\n\nWe went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine, the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count), and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS, they have complementary valet parking. \n\nEverything was just fantastic, I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back.
5	"""There was a wait for a table inside (107 degrees outside!) so we found 2 seats at the bar.  This place has an \LA vibe\"""" with the music, long drapey curtains, low lighting and candles.  I am an IPA fan so I had a flight of IPA's which were all excellent.  My wife chose a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc to go with the excellent homeade gaspaccio that had sprinkles of goat cheese on top and fresh avocado diced in, perfect for a hot day.  I had the Delux burger which was cooked perfectly and paired that with another beer sample this time the favorite was the \""""Coconut Joe\"""" from Papago Brewing company.  My wife had a turkey burger on a whole wheat bun and paired that with \""""The Big Red\"""" from Australia.  The staff was very helpful, allowing us to sample the beer and wine before committing to a whole glass.  Amanada helped my wife select lower calorie options as she is trying to cut back on calories but still enjoy eating out.  We recommend ordering the 1/2 order of mixed french fries which was still a very large portion.  The shopping cart of fries the the people next to us had was huge!  Be aware of ordering the chocolate lava cake as it is huge and for at least 4 people with 3 large ice cream balls (vanilla, chocolate and strawberry) with lava cake, a serving vessel of hot fudge to pour on top and at least 2 whole bananas!  Kimberly (the other bar tender) helped us pack some up to go."""""""
2	"""Generally I feel this place is over rated.  Service is very lacking.  (I actually unloaded my car myself while 4 bellmen stood in shade 10 feet from me at the main entrance at check in).  Some area of the property need updating.  My room was \OK\"""" but would like to see others.  Seemed over priced even during the off season.  The deck off my room was filthy with bird droppings, basically unusable.  Pools were nice but not clean. Rarely saw pool attendants. Pool towels available only at the main pool, with eight pools on property this seemed weird. Last day there I was asked to switch rooms as they had reserved my room for another quest.  Sorry not my problem, I had been there for a week!\n\nInterestingly some people seemed to have bashed the spa here, I didn't think it was that bad., I would give it 4 stars.  \n\nThe high end restaurant in the place (can't remember name) is good but VERY pricey and with strange decor (I understand that is subjective, some people are really into the Frank Loyd look).  Anyhow, stayed a week and wouldn't return, too many option in this area at these prices."""""""
3	The sushi was good (I only tried 2 rolls). The wine selection was GREAT! The service was good, and the price was a bit high. Over all I enjoyed my experience at RA. The only 2 negatives were, the women's bathroom was being remodeled so I had to used the men's....eeeewh, and it was FREEZING! For some reason the AC was on at 8 pm at night and it was cold outside. We asked them to turn it off because it was blowing right on our table and no one ever did. Since I was literally shivering I did not get to enjoy my experience as much as I would have liked. I really just wanted to go relax and chat with my friends after work, but I think I burned just as many calories sitting there freezing my ars off as I would have if I had gone to the gym. I'll go back when it is hot outside again.
4	Four Peaks is and was one of my favorite breweries, anywhere. The beer here is so freakin' good. (It's been my experience that it is not served super cold though.) And the food is delicious. I've spent many a'happy night here with good friends. I even had brunch here once on a Sunday, and it was fantastic.\n\nI'm a huge supported of reusing old buildings for new things. Tempe doesn't have many old buildings left, and nothing better could have gone in this location.\n\nMy only complaint is that things have changed over the years. The last time I went, the ID checker-guy almost sneered at me, like I wasn't cool enough to be there. I felt like I was being judged before I even walked in, and that's not cool. I just wanted a beer! You used to be able to sit down at an open table and now you can't. The place has lost some of the charm that I fell in love with as an ASU student. \n\nBut I still appreciate this place and rave about the beer they brew. If you've never been, you must go.
5	I think I found one of my new favorite places in Gilbert! It may be a bit of a hipsters paradise but I don't care...the food is so yummy! The ambiance is refreshing since there's too many chain food places in the east valley and you have to search high and low for something with a cool vibe. The drive is a bit much for us but I can see myself planning a 1/2 day in downtown Gilbert for food and shopping. Liberty is also a family friendly place and with the patio outside I hear is dog friendly too. Perfect for us since we're having our baby real soon and love to take our dog with us too. \n\nService was great. Everyone is so friendly and seating was not an issue. \n\nBack to the food..I ordered the Salmon BLT and loved it. My husband ordered the veggie scramble and though he commented that the eggs looked a bit overcooked he said he couldn't taste it being overcooked. He cleaned his plate within minutes. So no real complaints from us. Next time we go, I'll try one of the salads or side pasta dishes, those looked appetizing. The monster sized desserts were tempting but I'll save that for another trip as well.
3	A solid 3.5 stars.  My husband and I went here for a late dinner last Sunday evening.  The restaurant is very cute.  \n\nThe service was really slow.  It took at least 5 minutes for our waitress to come get our drink orders.  I think she was the only waitress working, but there were only 4 tables in the restaurant so that's not really an excuse!  She was also slow coming back to get our food order and bringing us the check.\n\nI got a glass of white sangria which was OK.  I'm used to sangria that has fruit in it, not just an orange wedge and a maraschino cherry garnishing the glass.  My husband got one of the specialty martini's.  I can't remember which one, but he enjoyed it.  \n\nWe shared the antipasto plate and I got a small strawberry and gorgonzola salad.  Everything on the antipasto plate was really good, but for $15 I just expected a little more cheese.  There was maybe 2-3oz of cheese on the entire plate.  They let you choose 4 cheeses which is nice, but I'd almost rather choose 2 or 3 and get more!  The meats were plentiful though, and very good.  My salad was incredible.  For a small salad it was pretty big and it was delicious.  It came with honey glazed pecans on it and they gave me a lot of pecans.  We ended our meal with the chocolate mouse with raspberries.  It was pretty good, my husband seemed to enjoy it more than I did though.  \n\nI would definitely come back and give a few more of the menu items a try!
2	"""I went to Doc's for a comedy show a few nights ago.  I had high hopes on walking in.  The room was really nice.  Big leather booths in the back and lots of tables, including tables for 2, with plenty of space in between them. That actually matters to me.  I don't like to be too close to strangers.  Hell I don't like to be too close to my friends half the time either, which explains a lot about my social life.\n\nWhen we came in we weren't sure where to sit, but asked at the front and were told to sit anywhere we like.  We chose a booth.  Not long after, the hostess came by and asked who had seated us there.  I think maybe she would have preferred we sit at a small table, but she was very accommodating.  This is where the beginning of a night full of \I don't have my shit together\"""" employees began.\n\nSeveral parties were coming through the restaurant, but there was no one at the door to collect the cover charge.  Two gals next to us ASKED their server if there was a cover, and the server basically said \""""I guess not if you came through the restaurant.\""""  They asked a second time about paying and were told \""""I don't think they charge cover until 11.\""""  That makes perfect sense, right?  Charging cover after the show is over.  It made me wonder how much money was lost that night.\n\nOur server was certainly no better.  I ordered a \""""honey deuce\"""" (grey goose, chambord, and lemonade) off their drink menu.  The server looked at me confused and left.  About 10 minutes later, he comes back empty-handed and asks again what I had ordered.  At that time, we ordered dinner.  We had come pretty early (about 45 minutes before show time) to minimize service issues.  It didn't work.  Our appetizers were a little slow, but not too bad.  The presentation was very nice, but unfortunately, that was all they had going for it.  The salmon croquettes were too salty, and frankly tasted like a frozen product.  The southern shrimp we ordered grilled, and while tasty, it was just shrimp with an average cocktail sauce.  What was unappealing was paying $9.99 for 4 shrimp.\n\nAfter our appetizer plates were cleared, we waited for an entree we were going to split.  And waited.  And waited.  It was pretty clear it was never coming.  Finally the server came by and told my husband something about the order, blaming the kitchen.  Blaming the kitchen doesn't work for me.  Had the server been paying attention to our table, he would have discovered the problem at least 15-20 minutes earlier.  But the Miles Bayou Chicken did finally arrive (\""""Chicken Breast rolled in shrimp and vegetables, wrapped with maple bacon,  crusted with black peppercorn, served with a sweet black butter rum sauce\"""").  Doesn't that sound good?  I suggest you savor the description, that was the best part of it.   I don't even recall there being shrimp involved with this dish.  The chicken was sliced and didn't taste like fresh chicken.  It tasted more like the chicken breasts you can buy frozen that have water added.  The entree wasn't horrible, just not nearly as good as it sounded.\n\nPerhaps the service is better in the restaurant, but I wasn't pleased enough with the food to go back for dinner.  I wouldn't hesitate, however, to go back for entertainment.  We did have a good time in spite of its shortcomings, and there is a Dairy Queen right across the street."""""""
1	"""Z Gallerie has some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced at a retail store.  With that said, let me be clear.  I am not as much referring to the workers in the store.  They were at least nice and tried to help (although I do feel they misrepresented things).  However, when contacting customer service to discuss my concern, I was essentially told \tough luck - there is nothing we can do.\""""  In every conversation I had, it was clear they couldn't care less if I every bought another thing at this store (I won't!).  \n\nBottom line - I bought a sofa from the web site (they didn't have one in store) - spent $2,500 for \""""down cushions\"""" and essentially got hard, foam cushions.  I could have gotten that for $1,000 somewhere else but I paid more because I thought I was getting a higher quality product.  Not true.  Add insult to injury - they treat their customers like crap.  \n\nOnly buy if you know for sure you won't have any issues.  If you do - they are likely to tell you what they told me - \""""sorry, nothing we can do.\"""""""""""
4	Don't be put off by the appearance.\nThe great little cash only restaurant has some of the best beans, rice and salsa I have had (I know that many will refute this).\nThe menu is what you would expect, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. all at a great price, as well as lunch and dinner specials that can't be beat.\nThere is only outside seating, on a make-shift patio.\nThere is the occasional loiterer who will ask for change or food, so it is best for take-out and to-go orders. But eating there is not bad.\nIt is right around the corner from me and part of my neighborhood. There are always people there, and having eaten there often, I know why. My only complaint is they are cash only.
4	good burger, though I wish that demi baguette was a little more toasted, or less bready more brioche like texture. I'm not a huge fan of the bread but it's not bad.  I normally don't like sweet potato fries, but they are really good.  Cause they are savory and not way sweet like the way most people serve them.  The meat is also cooked properly, I hate when I order a Medium burger and a friend orders a medium well and it's the same thing.
5	Me and my friends are from the midwest and the Midwest has good burgers. OMG Zinburger has the best burger ever. The patty is cooked perfectly and juicy. We had the zin burger and it blew our minds away. The service is also excellent. We didn't like the chocolate shake we ordered and it was replaced at no cost for a chocolate vanilla shake that was incredible. Love the burger. Love the shake. Love the service. Please open up in California.
4	I know it is ridiculous to spend $60 on a top for working out and $80-100 on pants for exercise.  That said, the products last quite some time, are well worth it and are designed with yoga and running workouts in mind.  My workouts range from Bodyrock with tons of jumping and lots of sweating to spin to yoga, so the workout gear from Lulu fits just fine.   The tanks don't chafe, the ones with built-in bras actually work really well, and the pants/capris are fabulous.  The bags I have purchased through Lulu seem to have been tested by women for a while before finally getting it right with numerous pockets, pouches, and helpfully designed features that make them perfect. \n\nI usually get my products from Lulu online but went into the store since I needed some capris before a trip the next day.  The capris were a huge hit. I live in Phoenix, and the studio capris were incredibly light weight and a now-everyday wear item.  \n\nThe staff were all super friendly, although also a bit hovering and constantly asking if I needed a dressing room (better than no staff and having to wait for a room though!)  The store is well designed with easy access and easy to find sizes and helpful staff in every corner.  The stores sometimes have more colors and options than what is online.  I didn't see the sale rack, and I need to ask next time! \n\nThis location offers the free yoga, running, and cross fit classes during the week.\n\nThe cons: Lulu's final sale items are final sale and non-returnable. So, if you choose something from the final sale, try it on, check for shoddy stitching and anything else funky.  The return policy is really strict.  An item that was regular price can be returned within 14 days of the original purchase date. All tags must be still attached.  From what I read on some of the Lululemon fan blogs, the quality has gone down hill after the manufacturing started in other locations besides the original Canada location.  Also bright colors and dark colors have bled. I had a dark Ta Ta Tamer (love the bra!) bleed onto a bright green tank.  I also had a pop orange cool racerback bleed onto a towel when sweating it out at the gym. I did follow all the specific detailed laundry rules too!
1	I should have went to the Safeway next door for sushi.\n\nThis was the first time I went to sushi joint, looked at the menu and decided that the best sounding thing was the steak. I opted for the grilled salmon and wasabi mash. While I am a huge sushi fan, the price of the rolls were a wee bit more expensive than some GOOD sushi places I went to. My friend opted for a bento box that had a crab nigiri (which was simply a half a stick of imitation Krab on top of rice). So sad. \n\nMy plate arrived and looked like a garden threw up on my plate. The steamed veggies were scattered around my plate like the salad shooter malfunctioned. The grilled salmon was just okay, served on top of wasabi mash that was also just okay. \n\nThe server was also very clueless. She brought over a bowl of miso soup and sat the soup between my friend and I. I wasn't sure who it belonged to so I asked for straws so we could share. =) She didn't think it was too funny. She said she wasn't sure whose meal it came with so she just left in the middle so we can figure it out. (THANKS!)\n\nBy the way, the waitresses were wearing traditional Chinese dresses. Shouldn't they be in a kimono or something? Who is the smart white guy that owns this place?!\n\nI walked away from Zen 32 and I won't be back.
5	I heard of this place from my buddies on Chandler PD as they go there often and told me to try it.  It's a cool theme in there, one I can relate to growing up in and around the firehouse with my dad.  Lots of firetrucks, hoses, and pictures around of firemen.  Lots of hotsauces when you walk in the door - that's nice.\nGood subs and hoagies and affordably priced - I got a great hot sub for less than what I typically pay for at Subway.\nAnd after going to their web site and learning that they have a Foundation where they give money and tools back to First Responders... I'm definitely returning and telling everybody I know about it.\nAnd for the record, all the guys and kids working there were really nice.
3	I am a big fan of Babbo...maybe just not this location as much as others.  I am giving this location 3 stars, but mind you the location on 16th St. is deserving of 4.  Guess it is all about the location in this case.\n\nWe arrived shortly after 7 pm on a Monday night.  The place was packed!  I really wanted to sit on the patio and eat, but apparently you can't drink alcoholic beverages outside, so inside it was.\n\nIt seemed as if they had about 4 new people starting.  Our server had a shadow and he followed every action she did in succession with her moves.  Slightly odd.\n\nThe bread was delivered to our table promptly.  What a nice treat!  I like that they sliced it up for us and brought us extras free of charge to munch on.  It was fresh, warm, and had the perfect amount of baked red onions on it to add a hint of sweetness.  Fear not, they also provide you with a plethora of oil and vinegar for dipping, to which I added mounds of pepper, parm cheese, and crushed red pepper to spice it up.\n\nWe decided to order a side mista salad to split with each other.  It was ehhhh, but not as fresh as I have experienced before.  I do really enjoy the mista salad and the variety of items that are in it.  It is not just your traditional crappy house salad that you get from many other competitor restaurants.\n\nThe food took a while to arrive, so more bread was delivered in the mean time.  I ordered the creamy garlic chicken and my fiance the southwestern chicken pasta.  For both, the sauce could have been a little thicker, but in either case it made for great dipping of the bread.  The sun dried tomatoes in my pasta were horribly sour and added a slightly funky taste to the whole meal.  I settled with picking them out and the rest was okay from that point forward.  I added in lots of extra parm cheese to give the sauce more thickness and ultimately provide more flavor.  \n\nI decided that I preferred the meal that my fiance ordered better than mine (I HATE when that happens!).  I did notice a lack of overall ingredients such as the bell peppers and green onions, but in either case his was delicious.  He mentioned that the peppers were a little undercooked and may have tasted better if they were sauteed. \n\nOverall, not a bad experience, but I definitely prefer the alternate locations as of this point.  I will definitely go back and give it a second chance and hopefully bump up my initial rating.
3	"""How do you say WOW backwards?  A girlfriend of mine mentioned that she wanted pizza and I was hesitant because I am a little bit of a pizza snob having had great pies in the northeast.  Why would I look in the southwest for good bread, bruschetta and salads?  Try the eggplant and sausage bruschetta in your medley of four.  I did not have one arrangement that was not amazing on the lips!  \n\nI was happy they had a happy hour menu but it meant that you had to sit in a certain area deemed to be the \bar\"""" versus the restaurant.   That was a bit crazy...and now that I remember, I have to remove one star from the rating just because of that policy..silly!\n\nLet me say that the ambience is nice and trendy and just cheesey enough to be okay...I mean do you really need a fake digital fireplace reflected on your wall?  No really? Do you?  And who is that woman muralled in the restaurant?    And with all these questions and concerns, I would certainly return since the food is soo tasty."""""""
1	The resort is beautiful.\n\nHowever, the spa left much to be desired. I had a hot stone massage, which I usually love. However, this was the worst massage I've ever had. First off, the masseuse reeked of garlic; the smell was overwhelming. Secondly, after about 35 minutes into my 60 minute massage, between getting my skin pinched between rocks, listening to the rocks grinding on the backs of my stud earrings, and the smell, I had to get out of the room.  The masseuse apologized saying that he was sorry I didn't enjoy my massage. \n\nI paid for the whole massage and left a 15% tip but hesitated complaining at the front desk because I didn't want to get the masseuse in trouble. However, upon thinking about it, I did contact the spa and left a voice mail message about my experience. That was four days ago and nobody has bothered to return my call. Boo, not very good customer service. Too bad, because the property is beautiful.
4	For a chain restaurant, the pizza was yummy.  The good score isn't just about the pizza though, our service was GREAT!  They (not our waitress) dropped a slice of our pizza when trying to serve it out of the deep dish.  About 10 minutes after, our waitress came out and profusely apologized and threw in a mini pizza for us.  They gave it to us at no cost (as it should have been, but it was nice anyway).\n\nOur waitress in general was super helpful in guiding us to the right meal.  Rather than telling us an item was terrible, she just tried to steer us in another direction, which I loved.  She was very friendly and there when we needed her.  They also offer a check in discount of $2 off which is awesome!\n\nThe biggest disappointment was their freshly baked cookie al la mode.  It was not a good cookie...I ate it of course, but I make better ones myself.  Save yourself the calories and skip the dessert, it was not worth it.
5	I've been eating here for years, since it was Sonora Brewery.  I've always loved the food, the beer, and the service.  I moved out of state a year ago, came back for business this week and HAD to have the yummy Kobe Burger.  And I'm pleased to say, they didn't let me down.  It was cooked perfectly, and the sweet potato fries appetizer was a great way to start the meal.  Vanilla porter, delicious!  And here's the kicker:  after not setting foot in the place for almost a full year, my server knew not only how I wanted my burger, but also remembered what kind of dressing I liked on the side to dip my fries in!  THAT'S personalized service!  Five stars, SunUp...You deserve 'em!
4	"""Delicious breakfast food and great space really make this place.  The long wait this time was disappointing (spring training and St. Patty's day the day before probably exacerbated the wait), but the wait for the food is still worth it.   A long wait for the food once we were seated, but chatting with good peeps I didn't even really notice.  That's the only minus to this place, really.\n\nThe food is very good.  I brought two newcomers here today who were impressed with the food.  They had veggie omelets and buttermilk pancakes.  Aren't they good Bonnie?  I ordered the egg bagel sandwich with applewood smoked ham (actually it was on sourdough because they ran out of bagel.  Lame but forgiven because they were very busy and it was still freaking good).  The ham is premium stuff and about 1/4\ thick.  Other times I have had the garlic mushroom omelet with (and they accomodated my request for brie and ham) in a sherry mushroom cream sauce - it was absolutely heavenly.\n\nThe eclectic furniture, bold colors of the interior and artwork for sale are noteworthy - but artwork for sale in the crapper?  Kinda gross..."""""""
5	"""I love this little local company's soap, logo and name.....  I mean, common'  who won't go \awe\"""" when they see the little pig and the name \""""Stinkin' Cute Soap\"""" :)    \n\nThe products are available online at their Website or at local farmer's market's around town.   All soaps are handcrafted locally, are made of goats milk and  many are Vegan and all-natural, which I love.   \n\nThe scents are all unique...I recently purchased a couple of flavors like:  Raspberry Lemonade, Strawberry Shortcake (a soap/exfolliant), Creme Brulee, and Grapefruit Margarita (citrus and clean smelling).   I resisted buying the Guiness-flavored soap (yup, it's really made with Guiness beer)...I'm going to hold off for the holidays to get that one for my husband.\n\nThe founder of the Stinkin' Cute Soap Company believes in giving back to the community and she created a product called \""""Save the Tata's\""""  with a portion going to Breast Cancer Society.  The owner will also make custom soaps and branding for baby showers, wedding showers, and other events.  I was recently at an event for a local school board candidate where Stinkin' Cute Soap Co created small soaps with the candidate's name and logo that were handed out in \""""goodie bags\""""! \n\nOne product I'm super in love with is their \""""Solid Lotion Bar\"""" ....yup, lotion in a stick.  It's convenient to carry around this in your purse or glove compartment during our especially dry weather.  It's kind of like a deodorant stick that you rub on your arms or legs and then rub the lotion in.   \n\nI believe in supporting local companies, who develop quality product and give back to the community!  Stinkin' Cute Soap Company is one of those!  Check them out online to see their schedule and their products...I only listed a couple of highlights, but they have tons of cute product ideas!"""""""
3	"""This place is a little difficult for me to review.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn across the street and this is the closest restaurant so off I went.\n\nI walked in and the owner or manager met me at the door and asked \how many\""""?\n\nI told him I wanted to order take out and handed me a menu and pointed to the waiting area which was covered in newspapers.  I chose to go to the bar, order a glass of wine, and peruse the menu.\n\nThe drinks are expensive but I didn't think the food was.  Less than $10 for my Mongolian Chicken which came with white sticky rice and a fortune cookie.  When ordering I asked if I could have fried rice instead of white rice but was told \""""no\"""".  Most places allow this for a nominal fee.\n\nFine by me.  Give the white rice.  Food was prepared and their to-go boxes were a lot better than the standard white Chinese \""""to go\"""" boxes.  They also included the plastic-ware, napkin, and soy sauce, which a lot of places forget.\n\nLooking around I found a whole lot of goodness along with a couple disappointments.  Most notably the newspaper strewn about and behind the bar, to the right were a lot of boxes stacked in an unsightly fashion.  I could have been a little more presentable in my opinion.\n\nI peeked into the dining room because I wanted to see if the piano music was piped in or live.  It was live which was very nice. Also, the dinning room looked very nice and cozy.\n\nAs I was leaving the same man who greeted me upon entering made sure to wish me a good evening.  My initial impression of the man was that he was surly and testy but that's just how he comes off.\n\nThe food was very good.  The Mongolian sauce was mixture of sweet with spice and the chicken and vegetables all tasted fresh."""""""
5	I was lured into this gallery by the vibrant colors and good fun that it's walls emanate. The clincher for me was a painting of two monkeys and a paper airplane hovering over the pair. Upon catching a glimpse of that scene, I had to walk through this gallery's doors and be part of the fun. \n\nI stress the word fun when it comes to this gallery because so much art is serious. There's nothing wrong with serious; some art should be serious. The world, more so, needs serious art. It's refreshing, however, to see more whimsical work on display. Wilde Meyer does not offer a lower caliber of fine art, but rather another degree of excellence to the fine art world. Check it out!
4	This is a COMPLETELY different experience than the Carolina's on 91st Ave and Peoria store. This location is clean, well-kept, looks new, and has a good vibe inside of it. The food was even better here. Everything at this location seems to be on a higher level. \n\nI wanted to get Huevos Rancheros, and it's not on the menu. Isn't this blasphemy? I would say so. Settled on the Enchilada, Tostada, Taco combo. Delish. \n\nEveryone has raved about the tortillas, and they really are all of that, and then some. \n\nThis is THE place in town to get quality FAST Mexican food. Worth the little detour from the Bertos brothers.
5	"""Sweet baby Jesus. All of my prayers have been answered. I left the Great State of Texas three years ago and have been disappointed by so many bbq restaurants throughout the state of Arizona. I was saddened by the \n\best bbq\"""" in Tucson and decided that, until I lived in Texas again, I would just live a meaningless bbq free existence. \n\nAs I moped through another day in the hottest place on the planet, my very thoughtful partner suggested that we try the best bbq in Phoenix, according to the Phoenix New Times. I resisted. I said I was tired, I made up lame excuses, I feigned heat sickness. When I had no more excuses I finally relented and joined him in what would be the most delicious dinner I have had in three f*in years. \n\nHighlights of the meal:\n\nBrisket- Tender, delicious, excellent rub and crust\nRibs- Fall of the bone meat with great flavor\nSauce- Just enough tang and sweet. Balanced like a god damned ballerina\nColeslaw- Sweet, sour, crunchy, yummy\nPotato salad-  Oh how I love thee\n\nI will be back again. I will blog about them. I will tell my friends. You will not be disappointed. If you don't believe me, go anyway. They offer free samples. If you don't cream your jeans, you can just walk out the door."""""""
5	I lost 60 lbs. this year and decided that my reward was to go to Brazil. You'd think as a waxing noobie I'd have chosen something more tame, like legs or eyebrows, but no. Nine months of being a low-fat raw vegan had made me strangely fearless. \n\nMy aesthetician, Rachael, was the best. She made me feel very comfortable, telling me all about the procedure and answered my every question. I can't say it was completely painless, but she said that successive treatments get a lot easier. Since there were no bite marks on the ceiling, I had to believe this was true.\n\nIf there was anything to improve, I'd say throw some pictures up on the walls or cover the fluorescent lights with those pretty cloud covers. We need something to look at during this special time of hair yanking. Otherwise, great service, great price. See you again!
5	What can I tell ya...it's SO good.  Have lived right around the corner from this place for 2 years and have probably been there once a week (sometimes more if I can convince someone to go for lunch!) and have never had a bad meal.  Yeah, maybe I have made some interesting choices that weren't for me, but even then I could taste the flavors and freshness in every dish.  My favs are the crispy rice noodle cake (how do they keep the veggies from not being soggy, over-cooked messes?), the papaya salad, shrimp in black bean sauce, crispy lemon chicken, pad thai and the soups are divine.  Oh, I forgot the spicy green beans.  And the desserts - a taste sensation.  \nJustina (what a gem) has recently just revamped the place and it looks fantastic.  Hard to believe this hip joint is nestled next to a dry cleaners (which I don't recommend...cannot believe some of the racists comments to come out the owners mouth on a few occasions) and a Walgreens.  \nAnd hey, it's BYOB, what's not to love about this place.  I wish I hadn't written this review because now all I can think about eating for dinner is crispy rice noodle cake and Cyclo is closed on Mondays. Blast you Yelp for making me Yelp!!!!!!!!!!
5	LOVE this place!! After living in Arizona for THREE years and having no luck finding a good Thai place I stumbled upon this little gem. I almost didn't go in because it really looked like an Americanized little fast food place, however I was starving and my only other option was Peter Piper Pizza (YUCK) so in I went. The first good sign was that all of the tables were full and there were probably 10-15 people waiting for take out. It was very busy. We got a seat and order some Yellow Curry and Pad Thai noodles. When I bit into this food it was like angels were singing from Heaven. Truly fantastic food!! The prices are great as well and everyone who works there is super friendly. This is now 'my' Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area. I HIGHLY recommend Thai House!
3	Sooooo, I had heard great things about Truckin' Good Food, and did lots of research on them before going to the Scottsdale Farmer's Market to stalk them.  We made a special trip to go find this crepe truck, and I must say the crepes were delicious.  Unfortunately my issue is with the wait and the lack of ingredients.  \n\nThere wasn't anyone in front of us, so we walked right up to the window and ordered two crepes. I ordered a nutella and banana crepe, except they didn't have any bananas, I was like that's fine...I'm here for a crepe, I will get one- so just plain nutella (but they didn't offer to reduce the price which sort of annoyed me).  Then we ordered the other sweet crepe which was lemon curd.  Since there wasn't anyone there, we thought it would be quick, however they said it would be 20 minutes for the crepes to be ready.  I was shocked.  How can to have customers wait for 20 minutes for crepes when there aren't even people in line.  I couldn't imagine how long it would take it there were people in front of us.\n\nFinally, after getting the crepes and getting a chance to eat them, I was at least happy with the result.  The crepes were flavorful (even if they were missing banana) and thin.  I'd go back, but hope that they had figured out how to get crepes out faster.
4	"""Went here today instead of My Big Fat Greek because honestly I find it overpriced for the quality they serve. My boyfriends little sister got some spicy chicken pita wrap with fries, he got two gyros, and I had the beef pita burger lunch special with rice and greek salad. Total came out to $24 which for three people is great. Our food took about 10 minutes to come out, I went to wash my hands in their bathroom and the water would not get hot no matter how long I waited ( I HATE THAT!) I saw on the table menu that they have three dolmas (dolmades) as a side order for $1.79 and I went to the counter to add it to our meals. \n\nA minute or so later and our food comes out, the salad was very nice and not heavy on the dressing like some places. I tried a few of the french fries and they were light and crisp, very good with ketchup. The spicy chicken is indeed hot, but the texture is great and it was cooked well. Their tzatziki is more like a cream cheese and not a sauce, but still very good. My \pita burger\"""" I ordered with red pepper hummus and it had lettuce and tomatoes on it as well, the beef was somewhat an odd texture but still good. The dolmas were cold and rice filled only, I thought both dolmas/dolmades (aren't they the same thing?) had some lamb/beef chunks but these tasted great none the less.\n\n I don't know what the prices are for dinner, but the lunch specials included drinks and two sides so it worked out great. Obviously this isn't authentic greek ( the only place worth that title is Zorba's in Chandler,) but it was delicious and not expensive so there was nothing to complain about. I want to try the lemon soup next time because to me that's the staple every \""""greek\"""" joint needs to perfect!"""""""
4	My absolute favorite thing about summer in Scottsdale is that restaurants and hotels get SUPER cheap and do every night happy hours. Literally, best Happy Hour in South Scottsdale, by far. I originally wanted to eat at Culinary Drop Out, but the line was long and I was STARVING. Went into Wildfish, because even though I had never eaten there, and was left without my Bible of Yelp, I took a chance since I had eaten at its North Scottsdale, Big Brother location, Eddie V's, dozens of times. The menu is very similar to Eddie V's, but I would say, a bit trendier. Me and my man had appetizers and I had a $5 Mojito, and it was delicious. I had ahi tuna tar tar, a green salad with shrimp, shrimp cocktail, and by far, the best calamari I had ever had. It was like, salty, sweet, crunchy, and had cashews on it. I couldn't tell if I was eating calamari, or a dessert! Go for Happy hour FOR SURE. Great atmosphere, too...
4	So after my latest frustrations with ZPizza I contacted management. I explained the situation and after an initial email I received a follow up. They didn't give me free pizza for life(guaranteed five stars) but they did give me a small discount on my next pizza which we ordered that night to see if things would change.\n\nI was told by management that they had new cooks and the online ordering I guess is not as straight forward on their end as it is for the customer so we called in our order last night. \n\nI am happy to report the pizza was pretty much perfect, not missing any toppings, a decent amount of toppings, etc. I am not sure the price was right but maybe their prices have gone up, even so I appreciated that management actually got back to me and that I can enjoy Z again.
4	I came here one Sunday morning when another restaurant had a line out the door. They said it would be a 30 minute wait (which was less than the other place) so we said we would stay. We got a table in 10 minutes and our coffee was out super quick, and was really good coffee! I ordered a classic breakfast of eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast and fruit. It came out quickly and tasted good. It was nothing memorable, I would say that the food is average...but I liked the speed of getting a table on a BUSY Sunday, the speed of the server and of the food coming out, so I will give it a pretty good rating overall.
1	"""I have had two experiences with Bella Nails, and I can't say that either was exceptionally great.  First, I went as a walk-in on a Sunday afternoon.  I was seated within a few minutes, and a man began my gel polish.  After five minutes of small talk, he left and walked over to two girls getting pedicures.  A new lady replaced him and continued my manicure.  After she took over, he grew progressively more friendly with the two girls, suggesting he be their boyfriend and offering them positions at the nail salon.  I sat through my entire service, listening to him flirt with the only other customers in the salon.  He did not acknowledge me when I thanked him upon leaving.  Although annoying and slightly uncomfortable, my first experience didn't deter me enough to not return.  About a month later, when two friends were visiting from out of town, we decided to get pedicures and manicures.  I thought of Bella (as it's close to my home), and I called to make appointments for that same afternoon.  We arrived at 2:45 for our 3 o'clock appointment.  There was no one available to help us even after announcing ourselves and reminding them of our scheduled appointments.  We were told to sit and \it will just be a few minutes.\""""  By 3:40 someone had just started one friend's pedicure, and at 4 o'clock another person finally began buffing my other friend's nails to start her manicure.  My friend getting a manicure chose her polish color from a palette on the desk, and the manicurist brought over an entirely different color.  My friend explained that this is not what she wanted, while the lady argued that it indeed was.  My friend even pointed out that the names were different, but the lady insisted.  Meanwhile, around 4:15, I was still waiting to begin my manicure.  Eventually, we ended up leaving--one complete pedicure, one (free) nail buffing, and another unhappy customer that plans to never return.  Icing on the cake?  As we left a man shouted, \""""Okay, well you try again tomorrow.\""""  I think not."""""""
2	Came here for breakfast and had a mixed experience.  I had their  Cinnamon  roll French toast and thought it was delicious.  Everything went down hill from there. \n\nI thought it was great that Black Bear offered a smaller size omelet for those not looking to have a large meal.  My wife ordered a small ham and cheese omelet and we were both shocked when we saw the hideous thing that was brought out.  It was two fried eggs with unmelted cheese and uncooked ham on top of it.  We sent it back to get melted. After they microwaved it, the dish became extremely greasy and salty.  It was gross.  Also, our sodas were flat and overly sweet with syrup.  \n\nThe French toast earned 2 of the 5 stars back after they lost all there stars on the omelet.
4	A caveat to this review is that I love to cook and make my own meal. Guess what; this is the place for control freaks like me. The fresh diversity of meats, chicken and fish; are outstanding! The veggies are very fresh as well. I recommend that you try the sauces first with the little spoons. Here you are master of your own pallet. You can ask them to use less or no oil to make the meal a little healthier. Choose wisely because the portions are as generous as you want to make of them! The owner is awesome and the cast and crew are ubber friendly. There happy hour specials are excellent if your a well drinker. I recommend making yourself a spicy Mongo beef. Use the N.Y strip instead of the sliced beef and you will know where I am coming from!
1	As a big breakfast lover I was pretty excited when I found out there was a new breakfast place opening with a name as great as Bacon. I figured with a name like that it's gotta be good right? I was wrong. Maybe they have the Swine flu.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went to Bacon last Sunday for breakfast. I ordered the scrambled eggs with (what else) bacon, potatoes and an english muffin. Boyfriend had french toast.\n\nIt took FOREVER to get our food. At least 2 tables who sat down after us got their food before we did. When we finally did get our food, mine was cold. The eggs were pretty good but the potatoes were cold and blah and the bacon was thin and just okay. \n\nIf you're gonna call your place Bacon you should have the best bacon ever! Not the case. Matt's Big Breakfast has much better bacon.\n\nAt the end of our meal one of the employees came over and apologized for our long wait time and presented us with coupons and invited us to come back. I was pleasantly surprised until I looked at the coupons and realized they expired at the end of April, which at the time was 4 days away! Gee, thanks Bacon!\n\nI won't be going back.
3	"""I came here for lunch last week with some friends to celebrate my belated birthday. We were disappointed Cafe Monarch was closed for the summer and we were looking for somewhere that was BYO because we were hauling around our wine. Viola! Coup de Tartes! \n\nWe all share so we can try a bit of everything (we do this pretty much everywhere) and we started with the goat cheese on toast and the onion tart. Both came with salads that were nicely dressed in vinaigrette's. Both appetizers were good, though the onion tart outshined the goat cheese. The tart was creamy, oniony and delicious. Everything we could hope for. Everyone enjoyed it. The goat on toast was exactly that:  Cheese on toast. It tasted good because I like goat cheese so much and it reminded me I needed to pick more up at the grocery store, but it really was nothing exciting. In fact, it's getting by far too much face time now. \n\nFor the entree we kept it light to save plenty of room for dessert. We shared the seafood salad and the ham and brie sandwich. The sandwich was just ham and brie on an average baguette. Like something you'd pick up at Safeway. The baguettes at Lee's Sandwiches are much better and the ham on the sandwich was the processed stuck-together loaf kind (like the Oscar Meyer packaged type). I've had by far better ham and brie sandwiches for two euros in the metro stations in France. Granted, that was in France but you get my drift. Clearly, we should have gone with the lamb sandwich. The salad was loaded with seafood and the dressing was fine but it didn't make me want to lick my plate and that's what I was looking for. Enough said. \n\nNext course, dessert. We ordered their seasonal tart, the smores, the \famous\"""" bananas foster brulee and the one I was looking most forward to, the dark chocolate salted caramel. First the salted caramel tart.. I had a fellow dark chocolate salted caramel lover at the table so we both dug right in and we were equally disappointed. It miraculously tasted nothing like chocolate, caramel or salt. Just sweet goo. I don't think we even finished it. The banana brulee tart was good, though not as good as I remembered it. The hi-light of dessert, surprisingly, was the smores. I was a little jaded because it came with milk chocolate (I'm a die hard dark chocolate lover and you know what they say, one you go... nevermind) but damn, that thing was good. A little graham cracker crust filled with creamy milk chocolate and topped with a toasted marshmallow. That plate deserved to get licked! \n\nI had been here once before a few years ago for dinner and I was disappointed that the lunch menu only had sandwiches and salads on it. I understand the need to keep it simple and quick, but not even a single entree? Nothing was bad but aside from the onion tart and the smores tart, nothing was a standout. I was just a little disappointed."""""""
4	I wish there was a Sprouts closer to me, but when I need my Sprouts fix, this is my go-to location. Think of Sprouts like Whole Foods eclectic little brother. It's full of organic cuisine, some of which is really tasty and some that is just a little too, umm, organic for my liking. However, typically I find delicious eats here. They have great finds such as Walden Farms dressing that has zero calories and fat. Yum! They have tasty sandwiches, delicious (and organic) desserts, items perfect for any dietary restriction and plenty of snacks that will keep your tummy satisfied and your waistline small. That's all for me, but after writing this review, I realized that I need to pay a visit to Sprouts very soon!
2	We went there Tuesday night for a friend's birthday celebration.  There were 8 of us in our party and we sat outside on the terrace.  It wasn't too busy there were plenty of tables free at 6:30 when we arrived.\n\nA few minutes later our appetizers and salads arrive.  The mussels were delicious.  They are prepared in a tomato, sausage, onion and pepper mix.  The salads were fine, nothing too exciting.\n\nOne of our party members knows the owner and went to talk to her about our lousy service.  She offered to bring us a free dessert, but basically acted like she didn't believe her.\n\nAt 8:20 our dinner arrives.  I ordered the angel hair pasta  and added a side of prawns to the dish.  I had exactly one bite of the pasta - it was cold and overcooked and absolutely flavorless.  yuck.  The prawns were beautiful and cooked to perfection but totally lacking in any seasoning.  The waitress disappeared so I took the lemon from my water and squeezed it over the prawns.  The waitress made absolutely no comment when she came to take away my plate.  My husbands steak was equally cold.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals.\n\nBy this time we were getting pretty cold, we noticed a dozen propane heaters in the corner.  Perhaps they were out of propane?\n\nAs we were sitting and chatting after dinner one of the kitchen staff started dragging big plastic garbage cans right past our table to the dumpster.  He made 3 trips, dragging the garbage cans right past us each time.  \n\nNot sure I'll return.

2	"""Vegetarian burrito AND grilled Vegetarian burritos are both made with animal lard (in the beans).  One employee shrugged her shoulders, another said \that's the way it is\"""", and a third said I'd just have to order it without the (lard) beans.  Why make this naive restaurant mistake?  Don't call it a vegetarian burrito if it isn't vegetarian.  Just call it a veggie burrito.   It's especially annoying because vegetarians tend to gravitate towards more gringo places like this one that are more likely to have vegetarian items than the more \""""traditional\"""" Mexican places where lard and chicken stock is put in everything.\n\nGrilled veggie burrito had cold cheese inside.  Not melted, not lukewarm, but cold.  Tortilla wasn't the slightest bit warm either, just as if it was served raw.  So there's this cool to the touch tortilla with cold cheese inside, and then the grilled veggies.  \n\nTables receive salsa which is nice, the hot is really more of a medium, but then a small portion of chips.  The one-top next to me had the same chips portion and we had 3 in our party.  Why do this to people?  You're going to hear a request for more chips within the first few minutes, and people are going to wonder why the table only had one little portion in the first place.\n\nAtmosphere is clean with huge mirrors on some of the walls, and a flat panel TV on the other showing a nature documentary.  A few fake Macaws hanging from the ceiling.  It still has a trace of the Pick Up Stix feel that used to be here but went out of business.  Ordering procedure is the same.\n\nStaff was entirely unlike most Mexican places - vast majority of people were caucasian, or gringo if you prefer, and that raises an eyebrow in an ethnic restaurant.  Maybe that matters to the reader here, maybe not.\n\nOn a positive note, the employees did check on tables as folks were dining, and were over the top with politeness.   That's incredibly rare these days."""""""
5	What makes me feel better about being another year older?  Perfectly cooked beets in a mustard cream sauce.  Thanks, Tuck Shop.  \n\nI had attempted to eat here a few weeks previously, but, unbeknownst to me, it was the Coronado Historic District Neighborhood Festival-- and the regretful host informed us the wait was an hour and a half.  The courteousness of the host, the brief peek I had of the interior that night, and a quick scan of their menu online when we got home secured it as a top choice for my birthday dinner, and by making my reservation for 12 a week in advance, we were in!\n\nBecause there were so many of us, we were able to order quite a few dishes and trade around-- a practice that the waiter had greatly encouraged when we ordered by saying the dishes were served 'family-style' and meant for sharing.  For that descriptor, I expected bigger portions, but they turned out to be closer to a sizing I generally prefer-- moderate. The quality was excellent, well-chosen flavor pairings, and everything had that great homemade quality-- nothing came out cookie-cutter style.    I was very interested in the cheese and chorizo stuffed Medjools, but as I'm a vegetarian-- I opted for the Fontina & Pear Panini plate. We even received an interesting tip from our waiter while gorging on the slab of chocolate decadence we ordered for dessert-- bleu cheese to break the palette and offset the sweetness.  Not bad, definitely for the adventurer.\n\nThe only thing I would have passed on was the cookie dough ball parting taster.  Their presentation was lovely, four or five little dough balls drizzled in chocolate-- though in the end, I've had better raw cookie dough (I've been spoiled by Wanda's Magical Cookie Dough from Sack's for 6 years now) and it didn't quite live up to the rest of the fare.  But hell-- they were free.
3	"""I've been here once or twice when I was younger, so obviously I can't remember what the food tasted like or my overall experience. \nToday I went for lunch with my husband and daughter and was pretty let down. \nThe ambiance was fun, we sat outside next to the waterfall (it was hot, but I love the sound of water).\nOur server was very nice and energetic but super slow. I don't know what his name was and it took forever to put our order in! Was it busy? No. It got pretty annoying because my 18 month old is FAR FROM patient. Oh well, she got back at slow service with the beautiful mess she left under her chair :)\nNone of their salads sounded good, but I'm picky with dressings. I'm sure they're great. I could have eaten burgers and fries but I'm really trying to eat healthy! SOOO I got a cup of soup and it was overpriced and wasn't \stop the presses\"""" fantastic. My bad.\nMy husband got the \""""Green Chili Philly\"""" and that was friggin' GREAT! I should have ignored my diet for one meal. \nMy daughter had chicken fingers and fries and those were also great! (Yes, I nibbled on a few).\n\nLesson learned? Do NOT go here for soup :)\nAll in all, it was OK."""""""
4	my family went to az for vacation and found reviews for this place on yelp. coming from CA, i've never had the luxury of trying fry bread. it's very similar to the asian indian prathara, but it seems a bit more greasy...but don't get me wrong, still very good.  we had the red chili ultimate taco - it was HUGE!  \n\nThe best was chocolate and butter fry bread - clogged arteries here we come (butter on top of something deep fried ...eeks).  definitely get this one to share.  my only regret is that i didnt try the honey fry bread.
1	"""The food is cooked in advance and reheated. I've never eaten anything like that before, the pork was 'gamey' (if that's possible, with refrigerator flavor), dry, tough and hard like a shell (like crispy without the crisp) on the outside. Frozen spinach with no seasoning. Asparagus was grilled, then re-grilled to heat back up (dry and over charred). Since I couldn't eat the pork and it was sitting there, the server asked how things were and I said it was dry and tough. He said it was because it was so thin it cooks quickly and that's why. I (not a chef) have grilled pork rollatini's before, and managed to not cook them to death. \nRegardless, it could not have been cooked from raw, it was beyond just plain overcooked. \nHe offered to replace it with pork souvlaki so I agreed, if it was fresh. It had better flavor but was 70% fat & sinew so I just ate what I could and gave up at that point. \nAfter the food was served the server went quiet, I think he knew it was gross. The leg of lamb was a slice of grey/brown and curled upwards at the edges. Canned beets. I don't understand having a restaurant if that's what's served... just sell retail or something if you want to run a business. Don't ruin all that perfectly good food while ripping people off, there's just no point in it. \n\Passionate owner\"""" my ass, someone who has passion for food would most likely murder anyone who treats it like this restaurant does."""""""

5	I love this place...it is right around the corner from my job and it tastes soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good! Can I just say that everything is so fresh and delicious...the carne asada burrito is AMAZING!!!! You have to get it with the guacamole...they make it fresh and its delicious! They have all different types of salsa that are all great! The chicken salad and the tacos are also phenomenal!  They have raspados too that are great!  They have just done it right and nothing is wrong about this place.
1	"""Where to begin?  This place can't decide whether it's a restaurant, bar, Indian Casino (the seating looks like poker tables) or bingo hall. There were three separate bars (all under staffed), a large stage and a lot of seating throughout.  Loud music, tons of people, etc.\n\nThe Food\nYou would think that a restaurant called \Primebar\"""" would have amazing PRIME steaks.  Not so much..the rib eye was tough with gristle- one of the worst cuts of meat my boyfriend has had in years.  My dish, the salmon, should have been called \""""salmon soup.\""""  It came in a bowl filled with about an inch and a half of broth.  The beet salad should have been called the \""""canned diced beet salad.\""""  And last but not least, the yellowfin tuna sashimi just sucked.\n\nThe Wine\nOrdered two bottles of Plumpjack (over $100 each) and they were served warm (obviously primebar doesn't store their wine in a cooler at the right temperature of 50-55 degrees).\n\nThe Service\nThe hostesses and bartenders were very nice.  Our waitress was sweet but when we asked her what cut of meat the \""""primebar cut\"""" was, she answered \""""beef I think.\"""" (kind of funny).  \n\nThe Crowd\nI'm speechless\n\n$400 later we drove to Ocean Club and had a fabulous time!"""""""
4	I was in the area yesterday wondering what to have for lunch when I remembered that I wanted to try Chestnut Lane, my first trip here they were closed for vacation, so now was my chance. \n\nThe parking lot is home to many businesses so you will be lucky if you can find a spot, I had to park in the back alley. \n\nI couldn't even enter when I walked up to the door due to the large crowed of people who arrived before me. \nThis place is TINY but in the cutest homey kind of way.\n\nFinally being able to creep into the doorway I eyed their salad case, which I have to say was the most visually stunning salad case I've ever laid my eyes on. Everything was so beautifully displayed and fresh looking. I knew I would have a hard time making up my mind. \n\nThe girl at the counter was very friendly and helpful, she even offered me a tasting of one of the new salads they just brought out to see if I liked it. \nIn the end I decided on the Chestnut Lane Chopped Salad (see pics) which was grilled natural chicken breast, corn, local tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, feta cheese, pumpkin seeds \nand chopped greens tossed with a balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nMy initial thought was how small it seemed for $12 but once I started eating it I was really pleased, it was just Delicious! \nEvery bite was full of flavor without being too heavily dressed and it even filled me up, although my inner pig would have liked to eat twice as much! \n\nIf I ever had my own little cafe it would be a lot like this, I cant wait to return to try more!
2	"""AZ Mills is really worth going to only if you are: hoping to see gang members; interested in meeting a gaggle of single mothers; or really pinching your pennies.\n\nEven though it's an outlet mall, I didn't find many \deals\"""" here.  The prices at Gap's outlet were great, but every shirt I picked up was clearly a defect.  The V-neck sweaters looked nice, for example, except the Vs were all skewed and cut against the grain of the fabric.  Fifty percent off a piece of crap is still too pricey.\n\nBut even if you loved the low prices, you'd still have to decide whether you want to wade through this crowd.  Maybe it's the economy or just that I went at a busy time, but the mall was packed with a rather unsavory potpourri of screaming toddlers, overweight schmos with plumber's crack, semi-hardcore cholos, and mile after mile of chatty single mothers.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the bathrooms need serious attention and the crowds are prohibitive.  But I suppose if you're feeling very light in the pocketbook, you could snag some pretty foxy almost-V-neck sweaters for cheap.  Shop on."""""""
5	I absolutely love this place! The fact it's only a couple miles from my house is an added bonus. \n\nIt's authentic northeastern Thai food. It's very good. I've backpacked through the region and know the cuisine, obviously not as much as someone who's lived there for years as an ex-pat, or a resident, but I feel I got a grasp of the cuisine in the month I lived there. \n\nThis place is phenomenal. It's the best Thai food I've had in the valley. Obviously it's not your typical Thai food restaurant, due to it being NE Thai, but don't let that turn you away. Don't let any of the bad reviews turn you away, I've been blown away by the food. \n\nTheir salads are all phenomenal. There is one with lettuce, glass noodles, bean sprouts, pork, and shrimp (forgot the name!) and that's my favorite. If you're not into spicy, order at a 1 or 2 spicy and they'll bring out the chili spice for you to put on yourself. I've ordered it a 3 spicy and it's almost too much for me to handle, and I LOVE spicy food and especially Thai spicy. They serve a pitcher of water at every table. Their larb salad is also to-die-for. \n\nThey serve traditional Thai soups like shrimp and rice, chicken and rice..etc. They're so good and a meal in and of themselves.
5	Shane's Rib Shack is my go to place for Lunch. You will spend between $7 - $10 dollars unless you go for the ribs. I have had just about everything on the menu. My favorite is the Beef Brisket Sandwich with the beans and a large drink. These sandwiches are huge and sometimes I can't finish them. Their ribs and chicken fingers along with the Big Dad Pork Sandwich are great as well. \n\nThey have all kinds of different barbeque sauces and the staff is friendly and very helpful. They have an outdoor area and just a relaxing place to have a meal.
4	"""I haven't been to a Ruby Tuesday's since the early 90's, back when a bunch of restaurants that all looked and sounded the same opened(TGIFridays, et al).  You know, the kind of restaurants that make the servers wear \flair,\"""" has a bunch of obnoxious crap on the wall, and has gimmicky sounding food.\n\nI wasn't really impressed then, which is probably why I haven't been back in 15+ years.\n\nBut, I have this friend who is a really picky eater and ends up eating at the same restaurant 80 times in a row, finally tires of it, then moves on to the next restaurant where he repeats the process.  His current fave is the newest addition to the corporate monstrosity that is the Tempe Marketplace.  Because he's the picky one, and he's usually driving, we let him pick the place.\n\nI wasn't thrilled to go to Ruby Tuesday's.  I kept having Office Space flashbacks of that dorky kid at Chotchkie's doing the finger-as-a-gun shooting thing.  Ugh.\n\nSo when I walked into the tastefully decorated restaurant with a rather large and decent salad bar, I was surprised. Our group of 5 was seated at a nice dining table that was off to the side a little bit instead of being crammed into a booth or in the middle of the dining room.  Our waitress was nice and accommodating to our needs, especially when it came to paying the bill, which they do with great efficiency.\n\nAnd, I'm a huge fan of salad bars. Especially when they have a selection of vegetables that is not limited to iceberg lettuce and dehydrated cucumbers.  I made myself a beautiful salad with mixed baby greens and a variety of colored vegetables. No offense to the staff, but my friend ordered a salad from the menu, and my concoction was wwwwwaaaaaaayyyyyy better looking.  I could easily have been satisfied with my vegetable artistry, but the lunch special entree included the salad bar.  So for $15 (tax and tip included) I had 2 turkey \""""sliders\"""", french fries, a gorgeous salad and an iced tea.  Thankfully, one of our cohort helped me out with the meal, because there was no way I could finish all of it.\n\nI admit I was wrong to be so judgemental. I'm sorry Ruby Tuesday, you deserve more credit than I gave you.  And to make it up to you, I promise to return and lay down more of my husband's hard earned cash."""""""

4	If you are hungry, Hula's will not let you down.  I have wanted to try Hula's for a long time and I am so happy that Groupon offered a deal.  I took my mom for brunch when she was in town.  Very friendly staff and I love the retro look of the place.  The best part....they have Sweet Potato Fries!!!  \n\nI decided on The Big Breakfast Sandwich.  Big is an understatement!  This sandwich is huge!  A big helping of scrambled eggs, some bacon and tomato, what else could you ask for.  An awesome breakfast sandwich that went great with my mimosa!\n\nMy mom went with the Polynesian Chicken Sandwich which was also fabulous.  Just the right about of teriyaki and pineapple piled on grilled chicken.  The pesto sauce was a great touch.  My roommate who is in love with sweet potato fries order a basket along with Island Eggs Benedict.  \n\nI will be going back to Hula's soon especially with the All-Day Drink Specials on Saturday and Sunday!
5	"""Great store! It was closing time and I just needed to pick up one item. The manager was so nice and let me in to grab what I needed. He went an extra step to help out a customer when it would have been easier just to say \Sorry, we are closed\"""" and shut the door. Even though it was after hours, ALL of the staff were in a good mood and very friendly. \n\nAlso, the store is clean and well put together. Lots of merchandise. Good location in the Arrowhead area with tons of other shopping very close. From the phone rep to the manager to the cashier all of the staff is super friendly and helpful. I will definitely keep shopping there....!"""""""
3	Had lunch here while in town for work, and later stopped back for a beer.  Food was average bar food, though they do that portion the ketchup thing (rather than have bottles at the table, or brought to the table, they bring out portions in little cups) which I think is silly.  My teriyaki chicken sandwich was just so-s0, but not bad.  There were like 6 people in the whole place, but the service was not all that attentive.  There was some good gossip happening as you could see all the staff clustered together chatting during our entire meal.  Later, the place was much busier, but the service at the bar - just to drink beer - was no better.  I'd go back, but I'd look for someplace as an alternative first.
4	My hunt for sheet music and music books sent me to this Sam Ash the other day.  The location is a bit bizarre, methinks.  Wouldn't the only Valley location for this make more sense in, oh I dunno, Tempe (and not some non-descript part of Glendale)??\n\nIn any event, the location was (oddly-enough) convenient for moi.  It's located in an old grocery store strip mall, all by its lonesome.  But in the middle of the day it was more hoppin than I expected.  \n\nThe customer service peeps were more than accommodating.  I had no idea what I was looking for, really, but they helped me spit it out.  \n\nThe instrument, guitar selection was wall-to-wall and went clear from the floor to the ceiling -- no space was unspoken for.  I rarely frequent music stores, but this once they were great -- would def. go back again.

4	"""Date Night Delux! \n\nThis place has a great atmosphere. My boyfriend and I went on our first date at Delux.  We shared a romantic mini shopping cart of french fries over a bright blue glowing table.  The Bar is lined with a great selection of Beer and I very much so enjoyed my wine. \n\nI had the Turkey Burger, which I never do, but I was trying to appear more health conscious to my new beau.  It was the first Vege Burger Ive ever truly enjoyed! It was so juicy and cooked to perfection.  My boyfriend had the cheesburger which he devoured and in the few bites it took him to down his dinner, he made \Mmmmm\"""" noises the entire time with his eyes closed as if he was in Burger Heaven. \n\nThe Staff was pretty attentive, and the open kitchen kept things interesting with the occasional flames of fire catching my eye.  The lighting was great, the music was good, the TVs had the right games on and even with all of that going on the mood was quiet and serene with a touch of intimate.\n\nMy only semi negative review is the location.  Its in a little shopping center, next to a Safeway and a frozen yogurt spot. A place like this deserves a more swanky, downtown feeling location with a nice view. \n\nMy boyfriend lives out of town but we go to Delux every time he's back to visit!

5	Best run ever!   It may not be the longest but it sure was fun, and what a great cause! \nOnly complaint I have (and I hate to complain about this cause)   When people sign up they for some reason like to put down that they are great runners with great times so they get put in the front of the group, well after the first mile they give up and walk, making obstacle for the rest of us.  If you have a chance to do this race, DO IT!
4	This CC is built on several green standards and the architecture and landscape is impressive in comparison to many of the Centers i attend. \nThe food court inside the CC is always only half open, but that's ok, because the only thing to do in the surrounding area is eat.\nThe downtown is very boring and seemingly deserted considering there's a metro shopping center and ASU within two blocks. It's like this every time I'm here. Where is everyone?  \nEven though the CC itself deserves 5 stars I almost gave this post 3 due to the uneventful city.
4	It was a.... Bed, Bath and Beyond.  Yeah, they don't differ that much place to place.  The staff here was very helpful, though for my taste they were perhaps a little over-zealous, can't be blamed for that.\n\nThe store isn't too huge, though still rather huge, so they don't carry everything the others do.  \n\nThe only reason I'm reviewing a BBnB and giving them 4 stars is that I was looking for a bread maker and they found one which had a price discrepancy that made it like $70 cheaper than it sells for else where.  They fought pretty hard to try to get me one at that price, to no avail but they tried while I kicked back in the homedics back molester...  Not a bad day.
4	My dog has a sensitive stomach and has to eat natural stuff. Is it a pain in the booty? Yes. Does my dog eat better than I do every month? Sadly, since after paying big bucks for her food I'm usually stuck with McDonalds for a few days afterwords. But after going from pet store to feed tacks, this is the only place I've found so far that has the best pricing on my little spoiled turd/puppy's Canidae dry food. \n\nThis is more of a food place, not much of a dog accessories or supply store. If you don't feed your dog any fancy stuff like human-grade food or canned squid, just go to your local Petsmart, but for natural food this is a convenient place to go. Could you find some dog treats on Amazon for cheaper? 90% of the time, yes, but if you need the food ASAP and are willing to pay $1-3 more than it usually would so you don't have to wait for it to ship out, this is a great local place to support.\n\nALSO, they give out a ton of free samples for you to try out and being the secret cheap hoarder that I am, I always grab some for my dog to try. The staff are more than happy to give you a ton and explain to you the pros and cons of each.

What was lunch? I went with the salad - just the salad - from the gigantic salad bar. No drink. Only water. So to me, that's one expensive salad. Sure, they have plenty to pile high on your plate, but I left feeling that I could make the very same salad for 1/2 the cost. \n\nAlso, if you're in line in front of regulars on the lunch rush, be prepared to have your personal space invaded. If you're not moving fast enough, they will likely just push you forward with their own trays. Seriously. I think I managed to throw together a pretty decent salad, but the fear of the lady with the big-lady-bag scared me to the register. \n\nI have no reason to go back.

1	I recently did the body wrap here. It was a horrible experience for me. I will never do one again! No one informed me that I was going to get burnt. I got burnt on my theigh, abdominal, and hip. It took 3 days to fade away, and it developed a water blister on the left side of my hip. Today you can still see the burn a little bit. Im hoping it does not scar. I called to member services to complain and they were NOT helpful at all! The girl offered to credit me a free session, I was like are you kidding me why would I want to go through this again after being burnt and terrified from it. I couldn't even put clothes on because it hurt so bad. At the time when I was getting it done I even told the girl I felt it burning and she told me it was normal. I basically got a 1-2 degree burn from this experience and all protan had to say was its normal it takes a few hours to a day to go away! NOT! This will probably leave a scar on my skin. If anyone does the body wrap I would make sure to ask all the questions before doing it.
4	Stopped in here for a first visit today at lunch time, joined by Norm R. & Mike C.  I had a Grilled Turkey Sandwich ($7.99) with a bowl of Chicken Corn Chowder for the included side.  The sandwich was good, but not a match for the Monterey Club Sandwich I enjoyed the other day at First Watch on Thomas.  The chowder was killer good & everything was nice about the restaurant and the service here, as it was at the other location.     :-)
5	I love Chino Bandito for takeout. I wouldn't want to eat there, but I like taking the blazing tin trough of goodness home to unwrap and savor it! My favorite is the Jade Chicken, alone or as a quesadilla. The jerk chicken is my other go-to selection but the egg fu young is another good option. JD likes the hengrenade chicken, barbequed pork,  the carnitas and the machaca all in quesadillas. \nI think the jerk fried rice is delicious and usually try to steal some of JD's since he gets double rice and no beans. I have to go with the black beans, even though their consistency reminds me of hot road tar. They taste kind of sweet. Add some of CB's homemade salsa and its a tantalizing side dish that compliments a really good takeout meal. The cookies arent bad either. Two combo meals with tax adds up to $17.33. Super cheap for the amout of food you get.
